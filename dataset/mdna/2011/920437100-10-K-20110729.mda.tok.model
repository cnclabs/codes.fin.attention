value line top ranked stocks timeliness rank and gained in the twelve months ended april   significantly ahead of the s p index which rose during the same period 
the nasdaq and the dow jones industrial average declined and respectively from the end of september to march  from march  to april   those indices have increased nearly and  respectively  with the nasdaq and the dow jones industrial average above their respective september levels 
nevertheless  the severe downturn experienced in the september to march period and continued volatility in the financial markets have resulted in many individual investors withdrawing money from equity investments  including equity mutual funds 
this risk averse temperament of investors continues to negatively impact both the company s revenues from its research periodicals and publications and the company s cash flows derived from its non voting revenues and non voting profits interests in eam 
investment management fees for fiscal declined primarily as a result of an decline in average value line fund assets under management during fiscal as compared to the average value line fund assets under management for the twelve months ended april  which we sometimes refer to as fiscal 
in response  the company continues to be diligent in operational and marketing execution  and in expense management 
results of operations the operating results of the company for fiscal year improved from the previous year

factors that have contributed to the decline in the investment periodicals and related publications revenues include competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no direct cost to their clients 
as of april   total company wide circulation has declined compared to total circulation at april  although renewal rates for the flagship product  the value line investment survey  are  up from for fiscal  the company is not adding enough new subscribers to offset the subscribers that choose not to renew the flagship product and other value line products 
the company has been successful in growing revenues from electronic investment periodicals within institutional sales  with earned revenues increasing  or for the twelve months ended april   as compared to fiscal gross institutional sales were  for the twelve months ended april   an increase of  or from fiscal this increase continues a positive growth trend for institutional sales  but is not sufficient to wholly offset the lost revenues from retail subscribers

the company was successful in growing electronic investment periodicals revenues within institutional sales  which increased  or from fiscal gross institutional sales for fiscal were  up  or  from fiscal within investment periodicals and related publications are subscription revenues derived from print and electronic products

vs 
unearned revenues short and long term for the twelve months ended april   print publication revenues decreased  or  from fiscal for the reasons described earlier 
print circulation  which has always dominated the company s subscription base  has fallen as of april  as compared to print circulation at april  for the twelve months ended april   electronic publications revenues were higher than for fiscal the electronic publication revenues are broken down into institutional accounts and retail subscribers 
for the twelve months ended april   institutional revenues increased  or  as compared to fiscal for the twelve months ended april  electronic publications revenues from retail subscribers were down  or  as compared to fiscal the company has relied more on its institutional sales marketing efforts  and the increase in institutional revenues is a direct result of a focused effort to sell to colleges  libraries and corporate accounts 
the decrease in electronic retail publications revenues is primarily attributable to the decrease in circulation within the company s software products  which have not had a major update recently 
for the twelve months ended april   print publication revenues decreased  or from fiscal fiscal print circulation  which has always dominated our subscription base  had decreased from year end fiscal electronic publications revenues decreased by  or less than for the twelve months ended april  as compared to fiscal the electronic publication revenues are broken down into institutional accounts and retail subscribers 
for the twelve months ended april   institutional revenues had increased  or  while revenues from retail subscribers were down  or  in each case as compared to fiscal the majority of the company s subscribers have traditionally been individual investors who generally receive printed publications via us mail on a weekly basis 
consistent with the experience of other print publishers in many fields  the company found that its universe of customers has been declining as individuals migrate to online delivered services 
investors interested in online investment information have access to free equity research from many sources 
for example  most retail broker dealers with online trading capabilities offer their customers free or low cost research services that directly compete with the company s services 
the company believes that the volatility of the equity market and the severe economic recession  which economics authorities say is likely to have ended during the fourth quarter of calendar  have to some extent eroded retail investor interest in equities 
the company also believes that the negative trend in overall subscription revenue is likely to continue  albeit at a slower rate than the decline experienced in recent years  until new products have been developed and marketed 
the company has established the goal of developing competitive electronic products and marketing them effectively through traditional and electronic channels 
towards that end  the company has been working closely with a third party firm with expertise both in crafting effective online marketing strategies and modernizing legacy information technology systems 
the company is not able to predict when these efforts will result in the launch of new services or whether they will be successful in reversing the trend of declining retail publishing revenues 
the value line timeliness ranking systemtm the ranking system  a component in the company s flagship product  the value line investment survey  is also an important part of the company s copyright data business 
during the twelve months ended april   the combined ranking system rank stock performance of allowing for weekly changes in ranks  compares very favorably to the s p index performance of 
by contrast  during fiscal  the combined ranking system rank and stock performance compared unfavorably to the s p index performance for that period 
the company attributes this relative underperformance to the rapid and severe price actions in the markets experienced during the fiscal period  which  appear to have favored short term investing  as investors bought well known names whose earnings had plunged and whose stock prices were depressed in hopes the stock prices would rebound 
such stocks are generally not well ranked by the company because the ranking system emphasizes among other data points  earnings results  cash flow and price momentum 
the ranking system is designed to be predictive over a six to twelve month period 
copyright data fees copyright data fees have increased  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to fiscal as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data representing billion in various products  as compared to four contracts and billion in assets at the end of fiscal  representing a increase in assets 
the company believes the growth of this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products 
this market has become significantly more competitive as a result of product diversification and increased use of indices by portfolio managers 
copyright data fees have been an important component of the company s plan to replace shrinking publishing revenues 
no new products have been added in fiscal year the company believes that the growth of this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products 
one account was added and one lost in june  so there was no net change in the number of accounts in fiscal for fiscal copyright data fees decreased  or  as compared to fiscal as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data and represented billion in various products  as compared to four contracts and billion in assets at the end of fiscal  representing a increase in assets 
despite the increase in year end assets under management from april  to april   average assets under management during the year ended april  were lower than for the year ended april  the company believes that this decrease in average assets under management resulted from both the underperformance by the ranking system in fiscal and the broad and deep declines in the equity markets from september until march which significantly impacted assets of the third party sponsors that are customers of our copyright data business and resulted in lower asset based fees paid to the company 
no new accounts were added in fiscal investment management segment as of the restructuring date  december   the company deconsolidated its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses and its interest in these businesses was restructured as a non voting revenues and non voting profits interest in eam 
accordingly  the company will no longer report this operation as a separate business segment  although it still maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business 
total assets in the value line funds managed by eam at april  were approximately billion  as compared to total assets in the value line funds managed by eam llc  the predecessor of eam  at april  of approximately billion 
this decrease of approximately million  or resulted primarily from net redemptions from all major fund categories  with market appreciation fully offsetting redemptions in the variable annuity asset class and partially offsetting redemptions in the equity fund class of assets in the value line funds

vs 
segment revenues from external customers segment profit from operations segment profit margin from operations period from may  through december  the decrease in the operating profit margin and segment operating profits in the investment periodicals  publishing and copyright data segment resulted primarily from the decline in investment publication and periodicals revenues without a proportionate decrease in expenses for production and administration  including overhead costs 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in copyright data revenues  which are asset based  during fiscal while the company s costs to provide the copyright data are relatively fixed 
the negative operating profit margin and operating loss in the investment management segment during fiscal resulted from million of expenses associated with the restructuring transaction  the non cash compensation to a former employee of million and recognition of  of expenses associated with an operating lease exit obligation partially offset by a reduction of million in estimated settlement expenses to administer the fair fund 
investment management fees and distribution revenues declined as compared to fiscal resulting from lower average assets under management in the value line mutual funds and from the investment management business being converted  on december  into a non voting revenues interest and a non voting profits interest which are not considered to be operating activities of the company 
fiscal s negative operating profit margin and loss was a direct result of the  provision for the settlement 
investment periodicals  publishing copyright data segment revenues from the company s investment periodicals  publishing copyright data business for fiscal declined from fiscal levels primarily due to the continued deterioration in circulation of the total product line while operating profit and operating profit margins declined due to the relatively fixed costs related to producing the company s products and overhead costs classified as administrative expenses 
the company believes that competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no cost to their clients contributed to the decline in revenue in this segment 
the recession and continued volatility in the markets have also contributed to the decline in subscriptions  to the company s products  as individuals have reduced many forms of discretionary spending 
also  some investors may have shifted from equity investments to fixed income investments 
the company provides only limited research on fixed income investments  and this is not a core aspect of value line s business 
the decline in the operating profit margin in this segment from fiscal s operating margin was offset partially by the increase in revenues from copyright data fees  which are asset based 
costs for the company s copyright data products are relatively fixed costs for the company  so that expenses do not increase proportionately to increases in revenue

management does not anticipate making any borrowings in fiscal retained earnings were over million and liquid assets over million at april  critical accounting estimates and policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent  and the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition income taxes reserve for settlement expenses revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenues come from the sale of print and electronic subscriptions and fees for copyright proprietary information  and  prior to december   investment management and b fees 
the company recognizes subscription revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription  which generally ranges from three months to one year or longer  varying based on the product or service

income taxes the company s effective annual income tax expense rate is based on the us federal and state and local jurisdiction tax rates on income and losses that are part of its consolidated financial statements 
tax planning opportunities and the blend of business income  including income derived from the company s non voting revenue and non voting profits interests in eam and income from securities transactions  will impact the effective tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s tax returns the company s cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as non taxable income that is not includable in the company s tax return and expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax return and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april  and  the company had  and  respectively  of deferred tax assets  which included  and  of short term deferred federal  state  and local taxes  respectively  related to the net operating loss carryforwards of million and million respectively 
in assessing the company s deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or utilized in the company s tax filings 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets the company determines a lesser allowance is required  the company would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause the company s income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  the company establishes reserves at the time that it determines that it is more likely than not that it will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
the company adjusts these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which the company has previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to the company s income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
reserve for settlement expenses as of april  and the company had  and  respectively  reserved for expected expenses related to the sec settlement 
the amount of the reserve for expected expense is an estimate of the expected cost of the administration of the fair fund established by the sec to reimburse shareholders who owned shares in the affected value line funds in the period covered by the settlement and other related costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks 
the company s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s business activities 
interest rate risk the company s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk 
despite this objective  management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  the company s management invests primarily in short term obligations maturing in six months to one year 
the fair values of the company s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table

equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold
