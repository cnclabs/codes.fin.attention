general the company s poultry operations are integrated through its control of all functions relative to the production of its chicken products  including hatching egg production  hatching  feed manufacturing  raising chickens to marketable age grow out  processing and marketing 
consistent with the poultry industry  the company s profitability is substantially impacted by the market price for its finished products and feed grains  both of which may fluctuate substantially and exhibit cyclical characteristics typically associated with commodity markets 
other costs  excluding feed grains  related to the profitability of the company s poultry operations  including hatching egg production  hatching  growing  and processing cost  are responsive to efficient cost containment programs and management practices

the company believes that value added products are subject to less price volatility and generate higher  more consistent profit margin than whole chickens ice packed and shipped in bulk form 
to reduce its exposure to market cyclicality that has historically characterized commodity chicken market prices  the company has increasingly concentrated on the production and marketing of value added product lines with emphasis on product quality  customer service  and brand recognition 
however  the company cannot eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in commodity market prices for chicken since market prices for value added products also exhibit cyclicality 
the company adds value to its poultry products by performing one or more processing steps beyond the stage where the whole chicken is first saleable as a finished product  such as cutting  deep chilling  packaging and labeling the product 
the company s prepared chicken product line includes approximately institutional and consumer packaged chicken items that it sells nationally  primarily to distributors and food service establishments

the company recorded a charge of million to lower the value of live broiler inventories on hand at october  from cost to market value  which resulted primarily from the significant increase in costs for corn and soybean meal 
when market conditions are favorable  the company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost  and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date 
however  the company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory on october  to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds during november and december will be higher than the anticipated sales price during those months 
accordingly  the company adjusted the value of live inventory from cost to estimated market value 
the company had no such charge at october  because the company estimated the cost to grow  process and distribute live birds in inventory on october  was lower than the anticipated sales price of the finish product 
for the twelve months ending october   cost of sales includes adjustments of million to record live broiler inventory at market value 
of this amount  million is considered a component of cost of sales as the related products have been sold  leaving a million reserve at october  these adjustments were necessary because the projected cost at that time to complete  process and sell the broilers was expected to exceed the market value of finished product

allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes provisions for probable doubtful accounts based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount  and the allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense would increase by the same amount 

table of contents inventories processed and prepared inventories and inventories of feed  eggs  medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
when market prices for poultry are low and feed grains are high  the company may be required to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market value  which would increase the company s cost of sales 
live poultry inventories of broilers are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeders at cost less accumulated amortization 
the cost associated with broiler inventories  consisting principally of chicks  feed  medicine and payments to the growers who raise the chicks for us  are accumulated during the growing period 
the cost associated with breeder inventories  consisting principally of breeder chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments are accumulated during the growing period 
capitalized breeder costs are then amortized over nine months using the straight line method 
mortality of broilers and breeders is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
if market prices for chicks  feed or medicine or if grower payments increase or decrease during the period  the company could have an increase or decrease in the market value of its inventory as well as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
should the company decide that the nine month amortization period used to amortize the breeder costs is no longer appropriate as a result of operational changes  a shorter or longer amortization period could increase or decrease the cost of sales recorded in future periods 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal charges to cost of sales to write down live poultry inventories 
the company made an adjustment to the value of its live inventories at october  as with processed inventories  the value of live chickens  the costs for which are accumulated during the life of a flock as each flock is fed and cared for  must be at the lower of cost or market 
because of relatively low market prices for poultry during november and december and high feed grains  the projected cost to complete  process and sell broilers included in live inventory at october  is expected to exceed the market value for the finished product 
accordingly  the company s results for the year ended october  include a charge of million before income taxes to reduce the value of live inventories from cost to market 
the company s live broiler inventories are recorded at cost at october  and because the estimated market value was higher than the estimated cost to complete those live broiler inventories 
breeders are generally not subject to lower of cost or market reserves due to their longer production lives 
long lived assets depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
the company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
if the company s assumptions with respect to the future expected cash flows associated with the use of long lived assets currently recorded change  then the company s determination that no impairment charges are necessary may change and result in the company recording an impairment charge in a future period 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for workers compensation benefits and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
management regularly reviews the assumptions used to recognize periodic expenses 
if historical experience proves not to be a good indicator of future expenses  if management were to use different actuarial assumptions  or if there is a negative trend in the company s claims history  there could be a significant increase or decrease in cost of sales depending on whether these expenses increased or decreased  respectively 

table of contents income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities and considers any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing the company s income tax expense 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
deferred income taxes are accounted for using the liability method and relate principally to depreciation expense  stock based compensation programs and self insurance programs accounted for differently for financial and income tax purposes 
valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset 
contingencies the company is involved in various claims and litigation incidental to its business 
although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty  management  upon the advice of counsel  is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company recognizes the costs of legal defense for the legal proceedings to which it is a party in the periods incurred 
after a considerable analysis of each case  the company determines the amount of reserves required  if any 
at this time  the company has not accrued any reserve for any of these matters 
future reserves may be required if losses are deemed reasonably estimable and probable due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of legal strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of reserves or by accruals of losses to reflect any adverse determinations of these legal proceedings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal  for use in manufacturing feed for its chickens 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
feed grains are subject to volatile price changes caused by factors described below that include weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect on the company s profitability 
generally  the company purchases feed ingredients for deferred delivery from one month to six months after the time of purchase 
the company sometimes purchases its feed ingredients for prompt delivery to its feed mills at market prices at the time of such purchases 
the grain purchases are made directly with our usual grain suppliers  which are companies in the regular business of supplying grain to end users  and do not involve options to purchase 

table of contents such purchases occur when senior management concludes that market factors indicate that prices at the time the grain is needed are likely to be higher than current prices  or where  based on current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products  management believes it can purchase feed ingredients at prices that will allow the company to earn a reasonable return for its shareholders 
market factors considered by management in determining whether or not and to what extent to buy grain for deferred delivery include current market prices  current and predicted weather patterns in the united states  south america  china and other grain producing areas  as such weather patterns might affect the planting  growing  harvesting and yield of feed grains  the expected size of the harvest of feed grains in the united states and other grain producing areas of the world as reported by governmental and private sources  current and expected changes to the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments  the relative strength of united states currency and expected changes therein as it might impact the ability of foreign countries to buy united states feed grain commodities  the current and expected volumes of export of feed grain commodities as reported by governmental and private sources  the current and expected use of available feed grains for uses other than as livestock feed grains such as the use of corn for the production of ethanol  which use is impacted by the price of crude oil  and current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products 
the company purchases physical grain  not financial instruments such as puts  calls or straddles that derive their value from the value of physical grain 
thus  the company does not use derivative financial instruments as defined by in asc  accounting for derivatives for instruments and hedging activities 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions or purchase any grain related contracts other than the physical grain contracts described above 
the cost of feed grains is recognized in cost of sales  on a first in first out basis  at the same time that the sales of the chickens that consume the feed grains are recognized 
the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
the company maintains certain of its debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt approximates the carrying amount at october  management believes the potential effects of near term changes in interest rates on the company s debt are not material 
the company is a party to no other market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
