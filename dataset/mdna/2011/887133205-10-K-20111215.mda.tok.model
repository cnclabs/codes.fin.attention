item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and uncertainties and elsewhere in this document 
overview we commenced our exploration stage in january with the change in the management of the company 
from january until march  we were strictly a mineral exploration company 
with the subsequent management appointments of john swallow and paul dircksen  the addition of randal hardy  our acquisition of a drilling services company  the acquisition of butte highlands  and the acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd  we continue to advance our business plan 
prior to our new business model  the addition of new management  the purchase of timberline drilling formerly known as kettle drilling  and a more active and focused exploration division  the company had no reported revenues and accumulated losses 
during  we re focused our business model on exploration and development  with future revenues and cash flows  if any  to be derived from any future mineral production 
during the year  we actively sought a buyer for our drilling services subsidiary  timberline drilling  as we had determined that timberline drilling was a non core business and that the market was right for achieving a sale of that subsidiary 
at our south eureka property in nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend  which includes the lookout mountain project  we followed up on s exploration and drilling program with a program that included an additional  foot drilling program designed to increase our estimated mineralized material and to provide more certainty regarding previous estimates 
we also began environmental 
table of contents baseline studies as part of early permitting related activities 
we announced an updated gold mineralization estimate in march of  and we expect to announce another update with increased mineralized material in the second quarter of fiscal year our butte highlands joint venture in montana continued to make progress during the fiscal year 
the joint venture completed a significant underground definition drilling program and continued work on the permitting requirements and a final mining plan and model with the anticipated commencement of gold production in our drilling services subsidiary  timberline drilling  was very successful in the united states during fiscal  however late in the year we announced that we had entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell timberline drilling 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  the sale of timberline drilling was completed for a total realized value of approximately million 
mineral exploration in june   we acquired staccato gold resources ltd 
and its south eureka property in the nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend  which includes the lookout mountain project  and is one of the largest undeveloped exploration properties in nevada  encompassing some square miles 
since our acquisition of the south eureka property  in fiscal we completed an aggressive work program  including more than  feet of surface drilling  and metallurgical bottle roll and column tests 
the program objective was designed to obtain sufficient data to complete an updated mineralization estimate  and an updated ni technical report was released by the company in march in addition  we completed detailed mapping of the geology of the property to better understand the controls of mineralization and to outline additional exploration drill targets for testing during the summer and fall of as of september  we are in the process of completing a  foot reverse circulation drilling program at south eureka  with two drill rigs operating on site 
the current program is designed to expand the size of the ni compliant technical report  perform additional metallurgical testing and geologic mapping  perform environmental baseline studies  as well as hydrological characterization studies all drilling is expected to be completed by november   and the company expects to complete an updated ni technical report in march at butte highlands  our joint venture partner completed a  foot underground core drilling program during the year ended september  the program was designed to collect definition drilling data to facilitate a mine model for production planning purposes during the initial period of mine production 
timberline is being carried to production and is a joint venture partner in the butte highlands joint venture 
the joint venture also continued to collect environmental baseline data as part of its application for an operating permit for the project from the state of montana 
the required application has been submitted for an operating permit at butte highlands  and work is continuing on the other associated permits required for the operation 
no material permitting obstacles are expected as the project advances toward targeted production 
surface facilities and infrastructure required for development and production are already in place under the company s exploration permit which has been in place since august timberline s butte highlands joint venture is the first example of the company s strategy to enter into creative structures that move production responsibility to other parties while allowing exposure to gold production  where financing has been provided by a third party with proven expertise in underground mine development and operation 
this has been achieved with no dilution to timberline shareholders 
as noted  all expenditures relating to the development of the projected underground mine are being paid by timberline s joint venture partner  with a total expected development budget of usd million 
our management and geologists remain committed to providing exploration and potential for discovery to our investors 
looking ahead  it is the opinion of management that our primary commodity focus should be on gold  and to a lesser extent on silver in the precious metals area 
furthermore  we believe that projects similar to lookout mountain and butte highlands are a good fit for the current environment and the unique qualifications of our people and strategic partners 
results of operations for years ended september  and consolidated results us year ended september  consolidated net loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax consolidated net loss our overall consolidated net loss for the year decreased in comparison to the prior year primarily as a result of a greater than million improvement in net income from our discontinued operations timberline drilling and a reduction in salaries  benefits and professional expenses  offset by a slightly greater than million increase in mineral exploration expenses by the company 
these exploration expenses were largely incurred at our south eureka property

the income tax benefit during the years ended september  and arose as a result of a reduction in deferred income tax liabilities assumed upon the acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd 
exploration expenses increased significantly from the previous year as a result of exploration drilling undertaken in at our south eureka lookout mountain property 
non cash expenses decreased significantly in compared to the prior year as a result of a reduced value of stock options vesting during the current year 
other general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increased investor relations activities  a revamping of the company s marketing information  corporate logo  and website  and the initiation of payment of cash compensation to members of the company s board of directors 
discontinued operations timberline drilling wwe in september  the company announced that it had entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell its wholly owned timberline drilling subsidiary 
the results of operations for timberline drilling have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during the year ended september  timberline drilling had record net income  primarily attributable to the addition of new customers during the year and an increase in the number of drill rigs working for timberline drilling s largest customer 
average daily production rates from operating drills and higher revenues per foot drilled contributed to the increase in net income from the previous year  offset in part by preparation costs associated with the deployment of surface drilling rigs to new customer locations and higher maintenance costs 
during the year ended september  timberline drilling provided million in cash to timberline resources in order to fund exploration expenses of the company 
subsequent to september  but prior to the filing of this report  the company completed its sale of timberline drilling for total consideration of approximately million  including the receipt of million in cash and an additional million in cash from timberline drilling s working capital immediately prior to closing

we plan to continue exploration programs on our material exploration properties  to fund some exploratory activities and drilling on early stage properties  and to seek additional acquisition opportunities 
during the year ended september   we entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell our timberline drilling subsidiary 
subsequent to september  but prior to the filing of this report  the sale of timberline drilling was completed in exchange for million in cash  an additional million in cash from the existing working capital of timberline drilling  a promissory note in the principal amount of million with an interest rate of per annum  the assumption by the purchaser of approximately million of certain indebtedness of timberline drilling  and the provision of future discounted drilling services  or cash  to the company up to a total value of  over a year period 
the total amount of consideration to be received by the company is also subject to adjustment based upon the working capital of timberline drilling as of the closing date of the sale 
the company anticipates this adjustment will result in additional consideration to be received in excess of million 

table of contents in conjunction with the sale of timberline drilling subsequent to september   the company repaid its  convertible term note payable to juniper resources  llc  an entity controlled by ron guill  a director of the company 
as a result  as of the date of filing of this report  the company has no outstanding debt and a balance of cash on hand of approximately million  with a working capital balance of approximately million 
during the year ended september   due to declining operational and financial results  we decided to cease the operations of timberline drilling s wholly owned mexican contract core drilling subsidiary  world wide exploration 
for additional information regarding the operating  investing and financing cash flows associated with our discontinued operations  please refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the closure of our mexican operations is not expected to have a material impact on the company s cash flows in future periods 
as a result of our current cash balance  the proceeds from the sale of our timberline drilling subsidiary subsequent to our fiscal year end  and our ability to curtail discretionary exploration expenditures as needed  management believes that it has sufficient working capital to meet the company s ongoing operating expenses for the next months 
additional financing may be required if the company seeks to undertake further property acquisitions or expand its currently planned exploration programs 
financing activities in february  the company initiated a registered direct offering of the company s common stock to institutional investors in the united states 
the company entered into securities purchase agreements to sell  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  and the offering closed in march the company incurred  in expenses with respect to the offering  resulting in net proceeds of  proceeds from the offering were used to fund ongoing exploration activities at our lookout mountain project  as well as for general working capital 
in november  the company initiated a private placement of the company s restricted common stock 
under the private placement subscription agreement  the company could sell up to  units for a total of  the company reserved the right to increase the amount of the offering in the event that the offering was oversubscribed 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one half of one class a warrant  with each whole warrant exercisable to acquire one additional share of common stock at an exercise price of per share until may  and thereafter at an exercise price of per share until november  no registration rights were granted for the shares of common stock or the shares of common stock underlying the warrants 
the units were sold for each  representing management s estimate of the fair value of the unit 
the company sold a total of  units for gross proceeds of  with the private placement closing on november  proceeds from the private placement were used for general working capital and to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities in mining services and exploration 
subsequent to september  but prior to the filing of this report  all of the class a warrants expired without exercise 
in october  warrants to purchase  common shares of the company were exercised by warrant holders at a price of per common share  for aggregate total proceeds of  proceeds from the warrant exercises were used for general working capital and to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities in mining services and exploration 
on october  the company entered into a convertible note with small mine development smd  a company owned by ron guill  a director of the company 
the convertible note has a principal amount of million and is collateralized with all of the stock of timberline drilling  inc  as well as a deed of trust covering the company s butte highlands property in silver bow county  montana the butte highlands property and a right of first refusal over the company s butte highlands property the right of first refusal 
the convertible note bears interest at annually  compounded monthly  with interest payments due at maturity on october  the convertible note  including accrued interest  is convertible into common stock by smd at any time prior to payment of the note in full  at a conversion price of per share 
should the company issue any form of equity security other than the company s common stock  smd may also convert all or any portion of the outstanding amount under the convertible term note into the new form of equity security at the issuance price of the new form of equity security 
the convertible note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty

the convertible note was also amended to require interest accrued subsequent to june  to be paid by the company to smd monthly  rather than accruing interest to maturity 
all other terms of the loan were unchanged 
effective december  smd assigned the convertible note and all related agreements and rights to juniper resources  llc  an entity also controlled by ron guill 

table of contents subsequent to september  but prior to filing this report  the company repaid the entire balance of the convertible note and accrued interest as of the date of repayment and cancelled all of the related agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies and estimates see note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a complete summary of the significant accounting policies used in the presentation of our financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to asset impairments and asset retirement obligations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows asset impairments significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized 
the evaluation of our mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals  underlying mineralized material associated with the properties  and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale 
if no mineable ore body is discovered  or market conditions for minerals deteriorate  there is the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties 
the company reviews the carrying value of equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the equipment is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
asset retirement obligations the company has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as a result we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs we expects to incur in association with our south eureka property 
the company estimated applicable inflation and credit adjusted risk free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames 
to the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change  such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded 
a liability is recognized for the present value of estimated environmental remediation asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the offsetting balance is charged to the related long lived asset 
adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the asc guidance for consolidation accounting was updated to require an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this statement requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after nov 
 accordingly  the company adopted this updated guidance in fiscal year with no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the asc guidance for fair value measurements was updated to require additional disclosures related to movements of assets among levels and of the three tier fair value hierarchy 
also  a reconciliation of purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of anything valued with a level method is required 
disclosure regarding fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities will be required 
the updated guidance was adopted by the company in its quarter ending december   except for disclosures about the activity in level fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of this updated guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this standard will require entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity is eliminated 
the new requirements are generally effective for public entities in fiscal years including interim periods beginning after december  management does not believe asu will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in september  the asc guidance for testing of goodwill for impairment was updated to allow for the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further goodwill impairment testing is necessary 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  however  earlier adoption of the guidance is allowed 
the company adopted this guidance for assessment of goodwill impairment as of september  without a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations timberline and its subsidiaries lease office space and storage facilities 
all of these facilities  which we believe are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future  are leased 
under the current leases  we paid rental payments of  in the fiscal year ending september  the current leases call for the following fiscal year payments   and  
certain information contained in this management discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking information and actual results could differ from estimates  expectations or beliefs contained in such statements
