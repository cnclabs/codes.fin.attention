item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide wireless and wireline telecommunications services in north america  bermuda and the caribbean 
through our operating subsidiaries  we offer the following principal services wireless 
in the united states  we offer wireless voice and data services to retail customers under the alltel name in rural markets located principally in the southeast and midwest 
additionally  we offer wholesale wireless voice and data roaming services to national  regional  local and selected international wireless carriers in rural markets located principally in the southwest and midwest united states 
we also offer wireless voice and data services to retail customers in guyana under the cellink name  in bermuda under the cellularone name  and in other smaller markets in the caribbean and the united states 
wireline 
our local telephone and data services include our operations in guyana and the mainland united states 
we are the exclusive provider of domestic wireline local and long distance telephone services in guyana and international voice and data communications into and out of guyana 
we also offer facilities based integrated voice and data communications services to enterprise and residential customers in new england  primarily in vermont  and wholesale transport services in new york state 
we were incorporated in delaware in and began trading publicly in since that time  we have engaged in strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our operations 
from through  a significant majority of our revenue was derived from our wireless and wireline operations in guyana  in which we have owned an interest since we also derived a portion of our revenue during that time from a non controlling investment made in in a voice and data services provider in bermuda 
the company has been a provider of fixed and portable wireless broadband data and dial up internet services through our us virgin islands subsidiary  acquired in  which provides a small portion of the company annual revenues 
in the past six years  we have added substantially to the diversity of our business and greatly reduced our historical dependence on our guyana operations for our financial results 
we entered the us mainland telecommunications market through the acquisition of an operator of a wholesale wireless network in rural portions of the southwest and midwest and we continued our us expansion with the acquisition of a wireline voice  broadband data and dial up service provider in new england 
in  we increased our investment in our bermuda business to a controlling interest and entered into new us and caribbean markets  including investments in two early stage businesses providing wholesale transport services in new york state and wireless voice and data services in turks and caicos 
in addition to the diversification of our business through acquisition  we have further accentuated our focus on our us operations with increased capital investment in and growth of our wholesale wireless business 
in the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of a portion of the former alltel network from verizon wireless through our us retail wireless business  which now provides wireless voice and data services in rural markets of the united states under the alltel brand name the alltel acquisition 
since  revenue from our us operations has significantly grown as a percentage of consolidated revenue and as a result of our alltel acquisition  a substantial majority of our consolidated revenue is now generated in the united states  mainly through mobile wireless operations 
we continue to actively evaluate additional investment and acquisition opportunities in the united states and the caribbean that meet our return on investment and other acquisition criteria 

table of contents the following chart summarizes the operating activities of our principal subsidiaries  the segments in which we report their revenue and the markets they served as of december  services segment markets wireless us wireless united states rural markets international integrated telephony guyana island wireless bermuda  turks and caicos  us virgin islands  aruba wireline international integrated telephony guyana us wireline united states new england and new york state we provide management  technical  financial  regulatory  and marketing services to our subsidiaries and typically receive a management fee equal to a percentage of their respective revenue 
management fees from consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation 
as discussed above  we have historically been dependent on our wholesale us wireless business and international integrated telephony operations for a majority of our revenue and profits 
the addition of our retail us wireless business following the alltel acquisition on april  has shifted our reliance substantially to our us wireless segment  which now includes both our wholesale and retail us wireless businesses 
for the year ended december   approximately of our consolidated revenue was generated by our us wireless segment  while only was generated by our international integrated telephony segment 
in comparison  for the year ended december   approximately of our consolidated revenue was generated by our us wireless segment then our rural wireless segment  as we did not own a us retail wireless business  while was generated by our international integrated telephony segment 
as of december   our us retail wireless services were offered in six states to approximately  customers under the alltel brand name 
our wireless licenses provide mobile data and voice coverage to a network footprint covering a population of approximately six million people as of december  through the alltel acquisition  we acquired a regional  non contiguous wireless network that we anticipate will require network expansion and improvements as well as roaming support to ensure ongoing nationwide coverage 
our alltel service offerings provide rate plans  advanced devices and features that include local and nationwide voice and data services on either a postpaid or prepaid basis 
we offer several rate plans designed for customers to choose the flexibility that they desire for their calling preferences  and believe that the ability to offer nationwide calling to our customers is a key factor in our ability to remain competitive in the telecommunications market 
the revenue of our us retail wireless business is primarily driven by the number of wireless retail subscribers  their adoption of our enhanced service offerings and their related voice and data usage 
the number of our retail subscribers and their usage volumes and patterns also has a major impact on the profitability of our us retail wireless operations 
our customer activity may be influenced by traditional retail selling periods  which may be seasonal in nature  and other factors that arise in connection with our rural customer base 
we are currently in a transition period as we move from the legacy alltel information technology systems and platforms to our own 
during this transition  which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of  we anticipate that our us retail wireless revenue will decline as our ability to drive subscriber additions  control churn and optimize our offerings is constrained 
during this time  we also expect to experience higher economic related churn as we eliminate certain sales and credit practices implemented by the management of the trust that operated the alltel assets from through the completion of the alltel acquisition 
during this time  we may engage in sales and promotional activities designed to retain or increase our 
table of contents customer base  but may be affected by other factors  including general economic conditions  the roaming and usage of our existing customer base and actions by our competitors  which may reduce or outweigh the success of our marketing or promotional efforts 
once this transition period expires  we expect that our churn will gradually improve as we are able to refine our service offerings 
the mix of our customers and their patterns of usage  particularly usage outside our network footprint  will have a significant impact on the level of profits for our us retail wireless business 
in general  we compete with national and regional wireless providers that offer both prepaid and postpaid services whose scale  resources and us network footprint are generally significantly greater than ours 
our ability to remain competitive and to maintain reasonable profit margins will depend  in part  on our ability to provide competitive pricing for our customers  to provide the latest mobile voice and data services in all of the areas where they wish to access those services and to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors 
in addition  the revenue and profits of our us wholesale wireless business are an important part of our overall us wireless revenues and are primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations we operate  the amount of voice and data traffic that each of these sites generates  and the rate we get paid from our carrier customers on that traffic 
we provide wholesale roaming services in a number of areas in the us mainly in the western united states where we do not also operate a retail wireless business 
as a result of the alltel acquisition  our reported wholesale wireless revenue also includes roaming revenue generation in areas in which we have retail wireless operations 
historically  the growth in same site voice and data volumes and the number of operated sites has outpaced the decline in data rates 
however  during  a significant decrease in the data rates almost offset overall voice and data traffic growth  and we expect that growth in will be offset by further decreased rates 
the growth of wholesale wireless revenue has historically been driven mainly by the rate at which we expand the number of base stations we operate 
we compete with other wireless service providers that operate networks in their markets and offer wholesale roaming services as well 
however  the most significant competitive factor we face in our us wholesale wireless business is the extent to which our carrier customers elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure including networks that we built out pursuant to certain roaming agreements in a market in which they operate  reducing or eliminating their need for our services in those markets 
for example  the acquisition by verizon wireless of alltel corporation and subsequent acquisition of certain divested alltel assets by at t resulted in our wholesale customers acquiring their own infrastructure in certain markets where they are currently served by us 
this has already resulted in some loss  and is expected to continue to result in a significant loss  of wireless wholesale revenue and operating income in future periods  which  if not offset by growth in other wholesale revenue generated or other sources  could materially reduce our overall operating profits 
while we are not able to forecast the extent of this revenue impact precisely  we expect that at the very least such loss may more than offset any growth in us wholesale wireless revenue during these periods 
acquisition of alltel assets on april   we completed our previously announced acquisition of a portion of the former alltel network from verizon wireless pursuant to the purchase agreement  dated june   by and between the company and verizon wireless 
pursuant to the alltel acquisition  verizon wireless contributed certain licenses  network assets  tower and other leases and other assets and certain related liabilities to a wholly owned subsidiary limited liability company  whose membership interests were acquired by our wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the acquisition  the company and verizon wireless entered into roaming and transition services arrangements and we obtained the rights to use the alltel brand and related service marks for up to twenty eight years in connection with the continuing operation of the acquired assets 
the purchase price of the acquisition was million  
table of contents plus approximately million in connection with a customary net working capital adjustment and other fees and expenses 
stimulus grants in and  we filed several applications for stimulus funds made available by the us government under provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of intended to stimulate the deployment of broadband infrastructure and services to rural  unserved and underserved areas 
in december  we were named to receive a million federal stimulus grant to fund our ion upstate new york rural broadband initiative  which involves building ten new segments of fiber optic  middle mile broadband infrastructure  serving more than rural communities in upstate new york and parts of pennsylvania and vermont 
the new project is being undertaken through our public private partnership with the development authority of the north country danc  a new york state public benefit corporation that owns and operates miles of fiber optic network and provides wholesale telecommunications transport services to voice  video  data and wireless service providers 
the million grant  awarded to us by the national telecommunications and information administration of the us department of commerce ntia  under its broadband technology opportunities program  will be paid over the course of the three year project period as expenses are incurred 
an additional million will be invested in the project by us and by danc 
the funding and build of this new project began in the third quarter of the results of our us fiber optic transport business are included in our us wireline segment 
on march  the ntia awarded the navajo tribal utility authority ntua a million federal stimulus grant 
the grant  along with partial matching funds  will provide broadband infrastructure access to the navajo nation across arizona  new mexico and utah 
as part of the project  we are proposing to partner with ntua to provide last mile services through a g lte network to be constructed as a part of this project 
our proposed partnership with ntua will receive a portion of the total grant to build out the last mile infrastructure 
this network will allow ntua to supply both fixed and mobile customers with high speed broadband access 
the funding of this project is not scheduled to begin until  once the necessary environmental site work is completed 
accordingly  we did not recognize any of the granted funds during the year ended december  the results of our wholesale us wireless business are included in our us wireless segment 
on july   in partnership with the vermont telecommunications authority the vta  we were awarded a million federal stimulus grant by the ntia 
the grant  along with partial matching funds to be contributed by us through a vermont subsidiary and the vta  will be invested in building a new fiber optic middle mile network in vermont to provide broadband and wireless services to community schools  colleges  libraries and state owned buildings in the area 
the funding of this project is not scheduled to occur until  once the necessary environmental site work is completed 
accordingly  we did not recognize any of the granted funds during the year ended december  the results of our us wireline business are included in our us wireline segment

stockholders us wireless revenue 
us wireless revenue includes voice and data services revenue from our prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as our wholesale roaming operations 
retail revenue is derived from access by our retail customers to and usage of our networks and facilities  including airtime  roaming and long distance as well as enhanced services such as caller identification  call waiting  voice mail and other features 
wholesale revenue is generated from providing mobile voice or data services to the customers of other wireless carriers and also includes revenue from other  related  wholesale services such as the provision of network switching services and certain wholesale transport services 

table of contents the retail portion of our us wireless revenue was million for the year ended december  all of which is attributable to revenue generated by assets we acquired in the alltel acquisition 
our us wireless postpaid subscriber base was approximately  and our prepaid subscriber base was approximately  at december  we had no us retail wireless revenue prior to the alltel acquisition in april we are currently in a transition period as we move from the legacy alltel network  information technology  and other systems and platforms and processes to our own 
during this transition period  which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of  we anticipate that our ability to drive subscriber additions  control churn and optimize our offerings will remain somewhat constrained  resulting in continued decline in our us retail wireless revenue 
the wholesale portion of our us wireless revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in wireless wholesale revenue was due to the million of roaming revenue generated by the networks we acquired in the alltel acquisition offset by a million decrease in revenues from our legacy us roaming network 
such decrease from our legacy us roaming network was due to scheduled decreases in roaming rates 
our alltel acquisition also increased our base stations from as of december  to  as of december  verizon acquisition of alltel in has caused some loss of wireless wholesale revenue and contributed to our lack of growth in as certain network assets acquired by verizon overlap geographically with areas of our legacy us roaming network where we previously provided wholesale roaming services to verizon 
similarly  at t acquisition of certain alltel assets and the completion of its previously announced umts network build in those areas overlapping our network in the southwestern united states is expected to negatively impact wireless wholesale revenue in for the year ended december   we estimate that revenues at risk from this overlap were approximately million 
this loss in wireless wholesale revenue could have a significant negative impact on our operating income if it is not offset or replaced by increased operating income from other sources 
while we expect to see some increase in wireless wholesale revenue from our us wireless business in geographical areas not impacted by verizon or at t acquisition of alltel networks  the pace of that increase in non alltel overlap markets is currently expected to be slower as compared to the growth in previous periods due to a reduction in the number of new sites and base stations added and recent reductions in roaming rates 
additional rate reductions  under previously contracted agreements  may affect our revenue growth in upcoming periods 
we also expect to receive a portion of the million grant from the ntia to build on the navajo nation during through our proposed partnership with ntua 
international wireless revenue 
international wireless revenue includes retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenue from international operations in bermuda and the caribbean 
international wireless revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily generated by increased subscribers  volume  and new service launches in our caribbean operations 
wireless subscribers in guyana increased  from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately  subscribers as of december  while we have experienced recent subscriber growth in guyana  competition remains strong  and the largely prepaid subscriber base means that subscribers and revenue could shift relatively quickly in future periods 
in addition  the overall number of our wireless subscribers in guyana could be reduced as a result of recent regulations imposed on telecommunications carriers  including our operations  to collect proof of address and photographic identification for all new and existing customers 

table of contents wireline revenue 
wireline revenue is generated by our wireline operations in guyana  including international telephone calls into and out of that country  our integrated voice and data operations in new england and our wholesale transport operations in new york state and in the western united states 
this revenue includes basic service fees  measured service revenue  and internet access fees  as well as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  long distance or toll charges  maintenance and equipment sales 
wireline revenue decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  an million decrease in international long distance revenue was partially offset by an increase in us revenue and growth generated by the july launch of our new fiber optic submarine cable in guyana 
our access lines in guyana grew from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december   an increase of 
revenue from the growth in access lines has been partially offset by a decrease in usage of those lines that is likely due to wireless service alternatives 
we also believe the decrease in international long distance revenue was a result of continued and considerable illegal bypass activities resulting in lost revenue opportunities  as well as an overall reduction in call volume into guyana attributable to the current difficult global economic environment 
in the us  we saw increased revenue from our upstate new york network transport service business 
we continue to add business customers in the us for our voice and data services  however  the overall revenue increase is partially offset by the decline in the residential data business  including dial up internet services 
in future periods  we anticipate that wireline revenue from our international long distance business in guyana may continue to decrease  but such decreases may be offset by increased revenue from data services to consumer enterprises in guyana  wholesale transport services in new york and integrated voice and data in vermont and new hampshire 
we are in the process of expanding our network in new york and began receiving a portion of a us million stimulus grant during the second half of equipment and other revenue 
equipment and other revenue represent revenue from wireless equipment sales  primarily handsets to retail customers  and other miscellaneous revenue items 
equipment and other revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to equipment sales from our alltel acquisition 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay for voice and data transport circuits in particular  the circuits between our wireless sites and our switches  internet capacity and other access fees we pay to terminate our calls  as well as customer bad debt expense 
termination and access fees increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   of which million of the increase resulted from the alltel acquisition 
the remaining increase of million was due to the expansion of our legacy us wireless network and international networks 
termination and access fees are expected to increase in future periods  but remain fairly proportionate to their related revenue as our networks expand 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our networks  including the salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the alltel acquisition 
we expect that engineering and operations expenses will increase in the future as our 
table of contents networks expand and require additional support and as we complete the transition of the network that we acquired as part of the alltel acquisition 
sales marketing and customer service expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits we pay to sales personnel  customer service expenses  sales commissions and the costs associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the majority of this increase is the result of the alltel acquisition 
sales and marketing expenses were particularly high in our us retail wireless business as we incurred additional expenses primarily related to an accelerated pace of customer contract renewals and extensions and some overlap of expenses related to the transition services being performed related to the alltel acquisition 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the short term as we continue to incur higher than normal customer transition and retention costs and attempt to offset customer churn 
equipment expenses 
equipment expenses include the costs of our handset and customer resale equipment at our retail wireless businesses 
equipment expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the alltel acquisition 
we expect that these expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the near term due to a high volume of handset upgrades related to the accelerated pace of customer contract renewals and extensions in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses also include internal costs associated with our performance of due diligence on our pending or completed acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we are currently in a transition period as we integrate the new alltel business and are incurring incremental general and administrative expenses relating to that transition 
during this transition period  which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of  we anticipate that we will incur higher than usual general and administrative expenses as certain significant costs continue to overlap with our already existing infrastructure 
once this transition period concludes  we expect that general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  will decrease 
acquisition related charges 
acquisition related charges include the external costs  such as legal  accounting  and consulting fees directly associated with acquisition related activities  which are expensed as incurred 
acquisition related charges do not include internal costs  such as employee salary and travel related expenses  incurred in connection with acquisitions and integrations 
for the year ended december   acquisition related charges for legal  banking  consulting and accounting fees in connection with the alltel acquisition were million  as compared to million for the year ended december  we expect that acquisition related expenses will continue to be incurred from time to time as the company continues to explore additional acquisition opportunities that arise 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation and amortization charges we record on our property and equipment and on certain intangible assets 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the addition of the alltel tangible and intangible assets as well as additional fixed assets from our network expansion in our us wireless business and in the caribbean 
we expect depreciation expense on our tangible assets to continue to increase as a result of a future network expansion in the us and elsewhere 
such increase  however  will be partially offset by a future decrease in the amortization of our intangible assets  which are being amortized using an accelerated amortization method 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our outstanding credit facilities including our interest rate swaps 
interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due to the amendment of our prior credit agreement  which increased both our outstanding debt and applicable interest rates on such debt 
on september   we entered into our amended credit facility  further increasing the amounts available for borrowing 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our amended term loan a facility  million outstanding under our amended term loan b facility  and million outstanding under our term loan c facility 
we had million in outstanding borrowings under our amended revolver loan as of december  in addition  as of december  we had interest rate swap agreements in place covering million of our outstanding borrowings 
interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest income decreased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of a decrease in our cash balances as well as the interest rates and subsequent amounts earned on our cash and investments 
gain on acquisition  net of tax 
gain on acquisition  net of tax  represents the gain we recognized on the alltel acquisition 
this gain was a result of a bargain purchase generated by the forced divesture of the assets that was required to be completed by verizon within a specified timeframe to a limited class of potential buyers 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates included our share of the earnings of an unconsolidated affiliate of our us wireless segment 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was million for the year ended december  we acquired this equity method investment in in connection with the alltel acquisition 
other income expense 
other income expense represents miscellaneous non operational income we earned or expenses we incurred 
other income decreased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes 
income tax expense includes federal and state income taxes at their respective statutory rates as well as foreign income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates 
since we operate in jurisdictions that have a wide range of statutory tax rates  our consolidated effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of income generated in those jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
for  the effective tax rate was reduced by the million bargain purchase gain which is shown net of deferred tax on our statements of operations 
partially offsetting this reduction was a million expense related to an increase in valuation allowance against the company foreign tax credit carryforward 
as part of the alltel acquisition  which was completed during the second quarter of  and the associated levels of future debt and interest service  the company re examined its projected mix of foreign source and us source earnings and concluded it is 
table of contents more likely than not that it will not generate enough foreign source income to utilize its existing foreign tax credits prior to their expiration date 
as a result  the company placed a full valuation allowance against those credits during the second quarter of excluding the bargain purchase gain and the increase in the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for net income loss attributable to non controlling interests 
net income attributable to non controlling interests includes minority shareholders share of net income in our less than wholly owned subsidiaries 
net income attributable to non controlling interests reflected an allocation of million of income for the year ended december  and million of losses for the year ended december  this decrease was a result of the allocation of non controlling shareholders share of losses at our early stage businesses 
net income attributable to atlantic tele network  inc stockholders 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  on a per share basis  net income increased from per basic and per diluted share to per basic and per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
segment results 
upon the completion of the alltel acquisition  the company restructured how it manages its business  and accordingly  modified its reportable segments 
the previously reported rural wireless segment has been combined with the operating results of alltel and is now being reported as the us wireless segment  which generates all of its revenue and has all of its assets located in the united states 
in addition  the previously reported wireless data segment has been merged into the island wireless segment which generates its revenue  and has its assets  in bermuda  turks and caicos  the us virgin islands and aruba 
integrated telephony international has been renamed international integrated telephony and has its assets located in guyana 
integrated telephony domestic has been renamed us wireline  and has its assets located in the united states 
the operating segments are managed separately because each offers different services and serves different markets

the wholesale portion of our us wireless revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
we did not have a retail wireless business in the united states in or the increase in wireless revenue from our wholesale us wireless business was due primarily to continued deployment of additional gsm and cdma wireless base stations and the expansion of our data capabilities  which generated growth in minutes of use and increased data and international roaming revenue  as well as the december acquisition of the wireless network assets of cc communications  a telecommunications company based in fallon  nevada 
as of december  a total of base stations were deployed as compared to base stations as of december  our us wireless revenue also increased as a result of growth in

such acquisitions may require external financing 
while there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms we will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses or make such investments  such acquisitions may be accomplished through the issuance of shares of our capital stock  payment of cash or incurrence of additional debt

as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the amended cobank credit agreement 
capital markets 
our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  the conditions of the telecommunications industry  our financial performance  the state of the capital markets and our compliance with securities and exchange commission sec requirements for the offering of securities 
on may   the sec declared effective our universal shelf registration statement 
this filing registered potential future offerings of our securities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations in any of the periods presented in the report 
critical accounting estimates we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
we base our estimates on our operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and we believe them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular transaction  we apply the criteria established by the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition and defer those items that do not meet the recognition criteria 
as a result of the cutoff times of our billing cycles  we are often required to estimate the amount of revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and historical evidence with each customer or carrier 
adjustments affecting revenue can and occasionally do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services 
table of contents were provided  billed and recorded as revenue  however historically these adjustments have not been material 
a small portion of our revenue is attributable to activation or reactivation fees  installation fees and equipment sales 
we evaluate these and  where the amounts charged for such services or the equipment do not represent a separate unit of accounting  these amounts are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer relationship period 
we apply judgment when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable  the credit quality of customer and  where necessary  other macro economic factors 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for impairments or disposals of long lived assets and the authoritative guidance for the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management assumptions and projections 
our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
we assess the recoverability of the value of our fcc licenses using a market approach 
we believe that our fcc licenses have an indefinite life based on historical ability to renew such licenses  that such renewals may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost  and that the related technology used is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor  such as an adverse change in the subsidiary operating market  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a license by license basis 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  tax audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accruals required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books as we do not 
table of contents believe that an adverse outcome is probable 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities in and out of level and level of the fair value hierarchy including the reasons for these transfers and also requires a reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
in addition to these new disclosure requirements  this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements 
for example  this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities 
this update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
this update was effective for companies with interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted the updated guidance in the first quarter of and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance that amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie 
the guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether tits variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
a company would be required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a vie operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance 
in addition  this guidance amends earlier guidance requiring ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
the adoption of the provisions of this guidance  which was effective january   did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance that requires us to revise our application of the acquisition method for business combinations in a number of significant aspects such as requiring us to expense transaction costs and to recognize of the acquiree assets and liabilities rather than a proportional share for acquisitions of less than of a business 
in addition  the guidance eliminates the step acquisition model and provides that all business combinations  whether full  partial  or step acquisitions  results in all assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance on january  the impact of the provisions of this guidance on our financial statements will be dependent upon the number of and magnitude of the acquisitions that are consummated 
under this new authoritative guidance  the company expensed acquisition related costs of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and recognized a bargain purchase gain of million  net of tax  during the year ended december  other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange sensitivity 
the functional currency we use in guyana is the us dollar because a significant portion of our guyana revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana 
table of contents dollar  however the guyanese exchange rate has remained at approximately guyana dollars to us dollar since so we have not recorded any foreign exchange gains or losses since that date 
all of our other foreign subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where the us dollar is the recognized currency 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited and relates primarily to our variable interest rate long term debt 
as of december   million of our long term debt has a fixed rate by way of interest rate swaps that effectively hedge our interest rate risk 
the remaining million of long term debt as of december  is subject to interest rate risk 
as a result of our hedging policy we believe our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is not material
