item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  which are included in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market single use medical products for interventional and diagnostic procedures 
we report our operations in two operating segments cardiovascular and endoscopy 
our cardiovascular segment consists of cardiology and radiology devices which assist in diagnosing and treating coronary arterial disease  peripheral vascular disease and other non vascular diseases and includes the embolotherapeutic products we acquired through our acquisition of biosphere 
our endoscopy segment consists of gastroenterology and pulmonology medical devices which assist in the palliative treatment of expanding esophageal  tracheobronchial and biliary strictures caused by malignant tumors 
on september   we completed our acquisition of biosphere in an all cash merger transaction valued at approximately million  inclusive of all common equity and series a preferred shares 
biosphere develops and markets embolotherapeutic products for the treatment of uterine fibroids  hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations 
we believe our acquisition of biosphere gives us a platform technology applicable to multiple therapeutic areas with significant market potential while leveraging existing interventional radiology call points 
two immediate applications for the embolotherapy are uterine fibroids and primary liver cancer 
on november   the fda approved our application to perform a phase clinical trial protocol to treat primary liver cancer with quadrasphere microspheres hqtace for delivery of doxorubicin 
we anticipate over the next three to four years that we will spend approximately million to support this clinical trial 
we believe if we are successful with this clinical trial  we will be the only market participant in this area with a product approved from the fda which will allow us to take advantage of a highly profitable market 
in september  we began our first direct shipments to chinese sub distributors from our distribution warehouse in china 
with our own direct sales force in china contacting sub distributors we have eliminated one of the distribution levels in china  which we believe will allow us to increase our sales  gross margins and net income from our product sales in china 
in addition  we are making significant investments in obtaining additional regulatory licenses from the chinese state food and drug administration in an effort to expand our product offerings in china 
we have made substantial investments over the last few years in the acquisition of new products with higher gross margins 
additionally  during this same timeframe we have made significant investments in our direct sales forces in the us  europe and china 
in order to successfully implement our business strategy  we will need to manage our operating expenses as a percentage of sales to achieve earnings growth in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses goodwill impairment charge income from operations income before income taxes net income 
table of contents listed below are the sales by business segment for the years ended december    and in thousands change change change cardiovascular stand alone devices custom kits and procedure trays inflation devices catheters embolization devices total endoscopy endoscopy devices total our endoscopy sales for of approximately million  when compared to sales of approximately million sales for includes only nine and one half months  were down on an annualized basis  primarily due to the elimination of sales of certain stent procedures and sales force turnover 
our cardiovascular sales for of approximately million  compared to cardiovascular sales of million  were up million or approximately 
this improvement was largely the result of an increase in sales of million  or of sales  related to our base business which excludes en snare and embolization devices sales  our acquisition of embolization devices from biosphere of million  or of sales  and million  or of sales  related to the en snare products we acquired from hatch in june of our growth in the cardiovascular business segment was favorably affected by increased sales of our base business growth of custom kits and procedure trays of approximately million  or of base business sales  catheters particularly our prelude sheath product line  micro access catheter product line and new microcatheter product line of approximately million  or of base business sales  and our stand alone devices particularly our hemostasis valves and stopcocks of approximately million  or of base business sales excludes million in en snare sales 
our sales increased during   and notwithstanding the fact that the markets for many of our products experienced slight pricing declines as our customers tried to reduce their costs 
substantially all of the increase in our revenues was attributable to increased unit sales 
sales by our european direct sales force are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the natural currency of a foreign country and the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by in compared to  decreased sales by in compared to  and increased sales by in compared to new products are another source of revenue growth 
in  and  our sales of new products represented  and of sales  respectively 
included in those sales are revenues from recent acquisitions of  and for  and  respectively 
the third main source of revenue increases came from market share gains in our existing product lines 
international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales 
the increase in was primarily related to increased sales in china  japan  germany and the uk 
the previous increases in and primarily resulted from greater acceptance of our products in international markets  continued growth in our european direct sales  and to a lesser degree  increased sales related to improvement in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  as discussed above 
our total direct sales in france  germany  the uk  belgium  the netherlands  denmark  sweden  austria  finland and ireland were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit in was primarily the result of the addition of higher margin en snare and embolization devices including million in costs related to mark up on finished goods acquired from hatch and biosphere 
the improved gross profits in can be attributed primarily to lower average fixed overhead unit costs through increased productivity as fixed costs are shared over an increased number of units and a reduction in material costs 
the increase in gross profits in resulted primarily from lower average fixed overhead unit costs resulting from increased production unit costs decreased as fixed costs were shared over an increased number of units  lower unit costs for products manufactured in mexico  customer price increases and production automation 
these improvements also helped offset raw material and production labor cost increases that occurred during our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to  million  or  in over  and million  or  in over the increase in selling  general 
table of contents and administrative expenses in was largely the result of our acquisition of biosphere in september and subsequent integration expenses additional sales representatives  marketing support and advertising costs 
in connection with the biosphere acquisition  we had million in one time severance costs and million in acquisition costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increased selling  general and administrative expenses in were primarily due to the increased expense associated with our acquisition and operation of the business and assets acquired from alveolus of million and the hiring of additional domestic and international sales representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in when compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of higher commissions commensurate with higher sales  management and sales bonuses for meeting quarterly and annually objectives  increased travel related expenses and increased national account administration fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were also affected by approximately  of damages net of insurance reimbursement of  sustained by our angleton  texas facility during hurricane ike in september research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in research and development expenses in was primarily the result of product development initiatives for the endoscopy business segment and embolization devices acquired from biosphere  as well as related regulatory support 
research and development increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in research and development expenses in related  in large part  to research and development project expenses for the alveolus business we acquired of million and to growth in our traditional organic research and development projects  some of which are nearing completion 
research and development increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in research and development expenses in related primarily to research and development head count additions and indirect costs to support an increase in the number of new products we launched 
our research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were for  for and for we have a full pipeline of new products and we believe that we have an effective level of capabilities and expertise to continue the flow of new internally developed products into the future with higher average gross margins 
our operating profits by business segment for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands operating income loss cardiovascular endoscopy total operating income our endoscopy net operating loss from operations for was approximately million  compared to an operating loss of million for the increase in loss from operations for was primarily affected by a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million and approximately million in additional research and development expenses over the increase in research and development expense in the endoscopy segment during was principally the result of our investment in new product development to help move this business segment to profitability 
we anticipate that we will launch four to five new endoscopy products during our cardiovascular operating income remained relatively unchanged for at approximately million  compared to net operating income of million for our effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for over was largely due to the fact that our irish operations  which are taxed at a lower income tax rate than our us and other foreign operations  made up a greater portion of our consolidated income compared to the decrease in the tax rate was also due to permanent tax benefits such as certain tax credits being applied to a lower pre tax book income in the decrease in the effective income tax rate for over was primarily related to the profitability of our irish operations  which are taxed at a lower income tax rate than our us and other foreign operations  research and development tax credits generated from our irish operations  and investment gains sustained in our deferred compensation that are not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for and was primarily the result of investment losses sustained in our deferred compensation plan that are not deductible for tax purposes 
our other income expense for  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in other expenses for over was principally the result of interest expense of 
table of contents approximately  on our long term debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of biosphere 
the decrease in other income for over was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income attributable to lower average cash balances  when compared to the increase in other income for and was primarily the result of an increase in interest income attributable to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates 
our net income for  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
net income for was unfavorably affected by the goodwill impairment of approximately million  or approximately million net of tax  related to our endoscopy reporting unit 
in addition  net income was negatively affected by biosphere acquisition costs of approximately million  or approximately million net of tax  biosphere severance costs of approximately million  or approximately million net of tax and biosphere s increase in the cost of goods sold related to mark up on finished goods of approximately million  or approximately million net of tax 
net income for was favorably affected by increased sales volumes  higher gross margins and a lower effective income tax rate  all of which offset higher selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses  primarily associated with our acquisition of the alveolus assets in the first quarter of net income for was positively affected by increased sales volumes and higher gross margins and partially offset by higher effective income tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources capital commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our capital commitments and contractual obligations as of december   including operating lease payments and office lease payments  as well as the future periods in which such payments are currently anticipated to become due payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases royalty obligations total contractual cash we have approximately million of unrecognized tax positions that have been recognized as liabilities that have not been included in the contractual obligations table due to uncertainty as to when such amounts may be settled 
additional information regarding our capital commitments and contractual obligations  including royalty payments  is contained in notes  and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  set forth in item below 
cash flows our cash flow from operations was million in  an increase of million over this increase in cash flow from operations in  when compared to  came primarily from an increase in non cash amortization of intangibles from our acquisitions of hatch and biosphere 
our working capital for  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital in from was primarily the result of the acquisition of biosphere s current assets primarily inventory and receivables 
the decrease in working capital in from was primarily the result of a decrease in cash of million related to our acquisition of the alveolus assets and the en snare product line 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash generated from our net income and cash generated from the issuance of shares of common stock related to employee stock option exercises 
during the year ended december   our inventory balances increased million  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in inventory was primarily related to our acquisition of the biosphere s inventory of approximately million  higher inventory levels of approximately million attributable to a increase in our base business  approximately million related to new product launches and approximately  related to our new chinese distribution warehouse and in transit inventory used to support our direct sales efforts in china 
during the year ended december   our inventory balances increased by approximately million  from million at december  to million at december  the increase resulted from a combination of factors  including the following principal elements a million increase in raw materials  work in 
table of contents process and finished goods inventory attributable to the products we acquired from hydromer  inc biosearch  hatch and alveolus  a change in our in transit finished goods and raw materials inventory shipping practices from air freight to ocean freight between our manufacturing facility in ireland and our distribution facility in the netherlands  which increased our in transit finished goods and raw materials inventory levels by four weeks or approximately million  higher inventory levels of approximately million attributable to a increase in our cardiovascular operating segment  and our management s decision to increase inventory levels for many of our products in order to improve product delivery time frames 
during the year ended december   our inventory balances increased by approximately million  from million at december  to million at december  this increase resulted primarily from higher inventory levels of approximately million attributable to a increase in sales 
on september  we entered into the credit agreement with the lenders and wells fargo  as administrative agent for the lenders 
as of december   wells fargo is the only bank involved in the credit agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the lenders have agreed to make revolving credit loans up to an aggregate amount of million 
wells fargo has also agreed to make swingline loans from time to time through the maturity date of september  in amounts equal to the difference between the amounts actually loaned by the lenders and the aggregate credit commitment 
our interest rate as of december  was a fixed rate of on million  a fixed rate at on million and a variable floating rate of on approximately million 
on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with bank of america  na bank of america  whereby bank of america agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of million 
our outstanding borrowings on this line of credit as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
available borrowings under this line of credit as of december  were million 
in connection with entering into the credit agreement  our unsecured line of credit with bank of america was terminated on september  on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with zions first national bank zions  whereby zions agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of million 
the loan expired on december   however  it was extended for an additional three years to december  but terminated in march there were no outstanding borrowings on this loan agreement as of december  historically  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with new facilities  production automation  product development and the introduction of new products 
over the last two years  we spent a substantial amount of cash in connection with our acquisition of certain assets and product lines million to acquire biosphere in september of and million to acquire the assets of alveolus and hatch  among other transactions  during 
we plan to construct two new production facilities over the next two years  in south jordan  utah and galway  ireland  and a parking terrace in south jordan  utah  with total anticipated costs of million 
in the event we pursue and complete similar transactions or acquisitions in the future  additional funds will likely be required to meet our strategic needs  which may require us to raise additional funds in the debt or equity markets 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances  anticipated future cash flows from operations  sales of equity  and existing lines of credit and committed debt financing will be adequate to fund our current and currently planned future operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ  and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies 
table of contents inventory obsolescence reserve 
our management reviews on a quarterly basis inventory quantities on hand for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
this review includes quantities on hand for both raw materials and finished goods 
based on this review  we provide a reserve for any slow moving finished good products or raw materials that we believe will expire prior to being sold or used to produce a finished good and any products that are unmarketable 
this review of inventory quantities for unmarketable and or slow moving products is based on forecasted product demand prior to expiration lives 
forecasted unit demand is derived from our historical experience of product sales and production raw material usage 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  we provided on an annual basis an obsolescence reserve expense of between million to million and have written off against such reserves between million and million on an annual basis 
based on this historical trend  we believe that the amount included in our obsolescence reserve represents an accurate estimate of the unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
a majority of our receivables are with hospitals which  over our history  have demonstrated favorable collection rates 
therefore  we have experienced relatively minimal bad debts from hospital customers 
in limited circumstances  we have written off bad debts as the result of the termination of our business relationships with foreign distributors 
the most significant write offs over our history have come from us packers who bundle our products in surgical trays 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
stock based compensation 
we measure share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the value of the award and recognize the cost as an expense over the term of the vesting period 
judgment is required in estimating the fair value of share based awards granted and their expected forfeiture rate 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
under our accounting policies  we initially recognize a tax position in our financial statements when it becomes more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax positions that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
although we believe our provisions for unrecognized tax positions are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
the tax law is subject to varied interpretations  and we have taken positions related to certain matters where the law is subject to interpretation 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provisions and operating results in the period s in which we make such determination 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
we test our goodwill balances for impairment as of july of each year  or whenever impairment indicators arise 
we utilize several reporting units in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
we assess the estimated fair value of reporting units based on discounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over implied fair value of that goodwill 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows and the length of time they will occur  which is based on internal forecasts  and a determination of a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
during our annual test of goodwill balances  which is completed during the third quarter of each year  we determined that our goodwill related to our endoscopy reporting unit was impaired 
we determined that based on estimated future cash flows for this reporting unit  discounted back to their present value using a discount rate that reflects the risk profiles of the underlying activities  the carry value amount of this reporting unit was less than its estimated fair value 
some of the factors that influence our estimated cash flows were slower sales growth in the products acquired from our alveolus acquisition in march of  uncertainty regarding acceptance of new products and continued operating losses in our endoscopy business segment 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this analysis requires similar significant judgments as those discussed above regarding goodwill  except that undiscounted cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of intangible assets to determine if impairment exists 
all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro and gbp relative to the value of the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in and our principal currency is  the us dollar 
during the year ended december   a portion of our revenues million  representing approximately of total sales was attributable to sales that were denominated in foreign currencies 
all other international sales were denominated in us dollars 
certain expenses are also denominated in foreign currencies  which partially offset risks associated with fluctuations of exchanges rates between foreign currencies on the one hand and the us dollar on the other hand 
because of our euro and gbp denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which our euro and gbp denominated revenues exceed our euro and gbp based expenses  the value of such euro and gbp denominated net income increases if the value of the euro and gbp increase relative to the value of the us dollar and decreases if the value of the euro and gbp decrease relative to the value of the u 
s 
dollar 
during the year ended december   the exchange rate between our foreign currencies against the us dollar resulted in a decrease of our gross revenues of approximately  and an increase of in gross profit 
on november   we forecasted a net exposure for december  representing the difference between euro and gbp denominated receivables and euro denominated payables of approximately  euros and  gbps 
in order to partially offset such risks at december   we entered into a day forward contract for the euro and gbp with a notional amount of approximately  euros and notional amount of  gbps 
we enter into similar transactions at various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks we bear throughout the year 
these contracts are marked to market at each month end 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded a net gain on all forward contracts of approximately   and  respectively  which is included in other income expense 
we do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of our open positions at december  and was not material 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under the credit agreement 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  on october   we entered into a libor based interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a five year period 
the interest rate swap locked in our interest rate on the expected outstanding balance of million at 
this instrument is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
excluding the million that is subject to a fixed rate under the interest rate swap  assuming the current level of borrowings remained the same  it is estimated that our interest expense and income before income taxes would change by approximately  annually for each one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
