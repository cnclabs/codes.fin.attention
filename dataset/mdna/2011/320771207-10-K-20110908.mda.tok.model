item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data included in item of this annual report and financial statements and supplementary data included in item of this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors included in item a of this annual report 
executive summary overview the presentation of our financial results beginning in fiscal significantly differs from prior fiscal years due to our adoption  effective july   of asu and asu effective july   we consolidated securitization trusts that we facilitated and previously accounted for off balance sheet  and we deconsolidated our indirect subsidiary ufsb spv 
as a result of these changes  as of july   our assets  liabilities and stockholders equity changed by billion  billion and million  respectively 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  we began reporting two lines of business for segment reporting purposes 
our determination of the activities that constitute a segment is based on the manner in which our chief operating decision makers measure profits or losses  assess performance and allocate resources 
the financial results of fmd and its subsidiaries that we historically reported in our consolidated results prior to july   with the exception of the deconsolidation of ufsb spv  are referred to as education financing throughout this annual report 
the financial results of our education financing segment have generally been derived from our services relating to education loans  and after january   include tuition planning  tuition billing and payment technology services as a result of our acquisition on december  of tms  formerly a division of keybank 
we purchased the assets  liabilities and operations of tms for million in cash 
see note  acquisition of tms  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
the vies which we consolidated upon our adoption of asu and asu consist of securitization trusts that purchased portfolios of education loans facilitated by us during fiscal through fiscal  although not all securitization trusts facilitated by us during that period were consolidated 
the securitization trusts financed purchases of education loans by issuing debt to third party investors 
the education loans purchased by the trusts were initially subject to a default repayment guaranty by teri  while the education loans purchased by the gate trusts were  with limited exceptions  not teri guaranteed 
of the consolidated securitization trusts  are trusts and three are gate trusts 
we refer to the consolidated trusts as the ncslt trusts throughout this annual report 
we present the financial results of the consolidated securitization trusts as a single segment  referred to as securitization trusts throughout this annual report 
the administration of these trusts  including investor reporting and default prevention and collection management services  is provided by our education financing segment 
we made our determination of entities to consolidate at july  using assumptions about the expected financial performance of each vie and our variable interests in them at that date 
asu requires us to continuously reassess whether consolidation of a vie is appropriate 
as a result  we may be required to consolidate or deconsolidate a vie in future periods 
changes in our determinations of which vie to consolidate may lead to increased volatility in our financial results and make comparisons of results between time periods challenging 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies consolidation  and note  consolidation  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
business trends  uncertainties and outlook the following discussion of business trends  uncertainties and outlook is focused on our education financing segment 
we have no ownership interest in the ncslt trusts as a result of our sale of the trust certificate to a third party in fiscal although we are required under gaap to reflect the net deficit of the consolidated securitization trusts in our accumulated deficit  and the revenues and expenses of these trusts in our statements of operations or loss per share  the financial performance of the ncslt trusts will ultimately inure to the third party owners of the residual interests 
our accumulated deficit as of june  included a deficit of billion related to the ncslt trusts 
any accumulated deficit generated by a consolidated trust will reverse out of our accumulated deficit or retained earnings  and be recorded as a non cash gain  when the trust s liabilities are extinguished or the trust is deconsolidated by us 
with respect to the ncslt trusts  the economic exposure for our stockholders has been structured to be limited to the value of our service revenue receivables due from these trusts or their third party owner  which constitute our variable interest  recorded by our education financing segment 
at june   our education financing segment had service revenue receivable of million due from the on and off balance sheet trusts and the third party owner of the trust certificate 
with respect to the gate trusts  we own of the residual interest 
as such  any cumulative profit generated by the gate trusts would ultimately be realized by our stockholders in the form of residual cash flow payments 

table of contents since fiscal  we have taken measures to adjust our business model  including effective march   we sold the trust certificate 
the sale of the trust certificate  combined with operating losses in fiscal  resulted in federal income tax refunds of million received in october in addition  the purchaser of the trust certificate agreed to bear all future federal and state tax liabilities associated with the ncslt trust residuals  which would have had a material negative effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
during fiscal  we designed our monogram platform  including the development and validation of our proprietary origination risk score model  product pricing  an enhanced application interface and additional disbursement and reporting capabilities 
we completed this development in august our monogram platform was designed in part to provide us with fee based income as we provide our services  reducing our dependence on the securitization market in order to generate revenue 
we expect to earn monthly service fees  as well as a share of the portfolio income generated over the life of the loans 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we disbursed the first loans based on our monogram platform 
in october  we received a federal income tax refund of million 
this refund included million attributable to our bank subsidiary  union federal  which was distributed to union federal pursuant to our tax sharing agreement 
in addition  in october  the ots  union federal s regulator at that time  approved a cash dividend from union federal to fmd of up to million  which union federal paid in full to fmd in november in october  the bankruptcy court granted the stipulation among teri  the creditors committee  fmd and its subsidiaries fmer and fmds 
the stipulation settled certain claims of fmd  fmer and fmds against teri s bankruptcy estate 
in november  the modified plan of reorganization became effective 
our securitization trusts segment recognized gains of million during the second quarter of fiscal pursuant to the modified plan of reorganization 
our education financing segment recognized gains of million during the second quarter of fiscal pursuant to the stipulation and the modified plan of reorganization 
in december  we completed our acquisition of the assets  liabilities and operations of tms from keybank for million 
see note  acquisition of tms  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed our previously announced review of strategic alternatives for union federal 
after an analysis of a broad range of alternatives by a special committee of independent directors and fmd s financial and legal advisors  we decided to retain our ownership of union federal 
we believe our acquisition of tms  along with our ability to implement our own education loan programs subject to regulatory constraints based on our monogram platform creates potential synergies with union federal 
on june   tms sold a portfolio of contracts with low cost  predominately faith based k schools to facts management for a purchase price up to million 
of the purchase price  million is subject to escrow until may based on post closing performance conditions 
on june   union federal launched the ufsb private student loan program  a monogram based national higher education loan program  and the prepgate loan program  a monogram based national k education loan program  and began accepting applications under these programs as of july  loan origination 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began performing services under loan program agreements for two clients  each related to a school certified education loan program funded by these clients and based on our monogram platform 
under the terms of the credit enhancement provisions in the loan program agreements  we may facilitate up to an aggregate of million in education loans over the life of these programs 
on june   we began performing services under a monogram based loan program 
table of contents agreement with our subsidiary  union federal  for school certified education loan programs  including a k loan program 
our monogram platform provides us with an opportunity  through our education financing segment  to originate  administer  manage and finance education loans  and we believe that the three lenders loan programs are a significant step in our return to the education lending marketplace 
historically  we have processed the greatest loan application volume during the summer months  as students and their families seek to borrow money in order to pay tuition costs for the fall semester or the entire academic year 
this summer was the first full peak origination season for monogram based loan offerings and marked our return  after a three year absence  to meaningful origination volumes 
since the launch of our lender clients respective monogram based loan programs through september   we processed over  loan applications  approved loans in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million and booked loans in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
it is too early  however  to determine the total application volume for this peak season  the extent to which application volume will ultimately result in booked loans or the overall characteristics of the booked loan portfolio 
portfolio performance 
credit performance of consumer related loans generally  as well as education loan portfolios included in our consolidated balance sheet and those held by other vies not consolidated by us  have been adversely affected by general economic conditions in the united states over the past three years 
these conditions have included higher unemployment rates  and credit performance has included higher levels of education loan defaults and lower recoveries on such defaults 
while there have been some recent improvements  these conditions have had  and may continue to have  a material adverse effect on legacy loan portfolio performance  as well as the estimated value of our service revenue receivables associated with the securitization trusts that we have previously facilitated 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we retroactively scored education loans held by the trusts into three risk segments using our proprietary risk score modeling  origination data and additional credit bureau data made available following origination  with education loans in segment expected to perform better than education loans in segment  and education loans in segment expected to perform better than education loans in segment during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed an analysis of the trusts projected post default recovery rates and made changes to those rates 
changes in post default recovery performance often lag behind most of the other loan performance assumptions due to the fact that over the life cycle of an education loan  recovery performance data is typically among the last performance data to become available 
following a review of available recovery data on education loans which defaulted during the recent stressed economic environment  we determined to change our net recovery rate assumption on a segmented basis 
while maintaining our assumed recovery expenses of  we decreased the net recovery rate assumption during the third quarter of fiscal from to for segment education loans  for segment education loans and for segment education loans 
these rates remained in place at june  see note  service revenue receivables and related income education loan performance assessment and assumptions overview  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information about the changes in the third quarter of fiscal capital markets 
we believe that conditions in the capital markets generally improved in fiscal compared to recent prior years 
in particular  investors in abs demonstrated greater interest in abs backed by private education loans that exhibit a strong credit profile 
additionally  investors began to demonstrate interest in longer duration abs in the sector 
as a result  we believe that there may be a near term opportunities to finance private education loans in the abs market 
we believe  however  that the structure and economics of any near term financing transaction may be materially different from prior transactions that we have sponsored 
such differences may include the potential for lower revenues  additional cash requirements on our part and a higher likelihood that we would be required to consolidate any new securitization trust in our financial statements 
uncertainties 
the near term financial performance and future growth of our education financing segment depends in large part on our ability to successfully market our monogram platform and successfully 
table of contents integrate tms into our operations so that we may transition to more fee based revenue  while growing and diversifying our client base 
facilitated loan volume is a key element of our financial results and business strategy  and we believe that the initial results from this peak season demonstrate market demand for monogram based loans 
we have invested in our distribution capabilities over the course of the past year  including our school channel sales force and tms  but we face challenges in increasing loan volumes after our prolonged absence from the marketplace 
for example  competitors with larger customer bases  greater name or brand recognition  or more established customer relationships than those of our clients  have an advantage in attracting loan applicants at a lower acquisition cost than us and making education loans on a recurring  or serialized  basis 
this disadvantage for us is particularly acute now because our clients monogram based loan programs were only launched in fiscal our long term success also depends on our ability to attract additional lender clients  or otherwise obtain additional sources of interim or permanent financing 
this is particularly the case in light of regulatory conditions and approvals relating to the ufsb private student loan program 
to date  we have entered into education loan program agreements based on our monogram platform with three lenders 
we are uncertain as to the degree of market acceptance that our monogram platform will achieve  particularly in the current economic environment where lenders continue to evaluate their education lending business models 
we believe  however  that the credit quality of the loan portfolios originated this peak season will be attractive to additional potential clients  as well as capital markets participants 
we also believe that the ability to permanently finance private education loan portfolios through the capital markets would make our products and services more attractive to lenders and would accelerate improvement in our long term financial results 
we are uncertain of the volume of education loans to be generated by our three lenders monogram loan programs  or any additional lender clients  during fiscal it is our view that returning to profitability will be dependent on a number of factors  including our loan capacity and related volumes  premiums and financing alternatives  as well as expense management and growth at tms and union federal 
in particular  we need to generate loan volumes substantially greater than those that we have generated to date  as well as to develop funding capacity for monogram based loan programs at loan volume levels greater than those of our initial three clients 
changes in any of the following factors could materially affect our financial results the extent to which our services and products  including our monogram platform  gain market share and remain competitive at pricing favorable to us  the amount of education loan volume that we are able to generate under our monogram based loan programs  demand for education financing  which may be affected by changes in limitations established by the federal government on the amount of federal loans that a student can receive  the terms and eligibility criteria for loans and grants under federal or state government programs and legislation recently passed or currently under consideration  competition for providing education financing and level of lender participation in the education lending market  our ability to successfully integrate tms into our business model and realize the anticipated financial benefits of our acquisition of tms  conditions in the education loan financing market  including the costs or availability of financing  rating agency assumptions or actions  and market receptivity to education loan asset backed securitizations  interest rates  unemployment rates and the general consumer credit environment  including their effects on our assumed discount  default and prepayment rates  the forward libor curve and the securitization trusts ability to recover principal and interest from borrowers  including the effectiveness of various risk mitigation strategies  
table of contents any challenge relating to the federal income tax treatment of our sale of the trust certificate to a third party in fiscal  or the asset services agreement between us and the purchaser of the trust certificate  including proceedings related to federal income tax refunds previously received as a result of the audit currently being conducted by the irs or otherwise  the resolution of litigation pertaining to our massachusetts state income tax returns for fiscal through fiscal  application of critical accounting policies and estimates  which impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities  as well as our determinations to consolidate or deconsolidate a vie  regulatory requirements applicable to union federal  tms and us  including conditions and approvals relating to the ufsb private student loan program  which limit union federal s ability to fund loans  and the dodd frank act enacted in july  which could require changes to our operational and compliance practices  as well as increased costs  applicable laws and regulations  which may affect the terms upon which lenders agree to make education loans  the terms of future portfolio funding transactions  including disclosure and risk retention requirements  recovery rates on defaulted education loans and the cost and complexity of our loan facilitation operations  and departures or long term unavailability of key personnel 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   june  and june  financial results summary we present our results of operations first on a consolidated basis in accordance with gaap 
however  we focus our discussion of the results on our education financing segment  which represents our core business 
the following table summarizes our results of operations by reporting segment fiscal years ended june  education financing securitization trusts eliminations total education financing deconsolidation and eliminations total education financing deconsolidation and eliminations total dollars and shares in thousands  except per share amounts revenues net interest income loss after provision for loan losses total non interest revenues total revenues total non interest expenses loss before other income and income taxes other income gain from teri settlement loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net income loss per basic and diluted share basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
table of contents we reported a net loss of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal the increase in the net loss year over year is attributable to the consolidation of the securitization trusts  which reported a net loss of million in fiscal this net loss included million of loss from the ncslt trusts and million of net income  or per diluted share  from the gate trusts 
our education financing segment reduced its net loss for fiscal  which is discussed in greater detail in our discussion of our education financing segment under education financing  below 
with respect to our education financing segment  the net loss improved by million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the following impacted the results of our education financing segment a decrease of million in non interest expenses 
non interest expenses declined primarily as a result of recognizing no losses on education loans held for sale in fiscal versus losses of million in fiscal also impacting the decline in non interest expenses were lower general and administrative expenses  primarily as a result of a decrease in occupancy  equipment and depreciation costs of million  and lower compensation and benefits expenses of million  partially offset by an increase of million in expenses related to tms  which was acquired in mid fiscal a reduction of income tax benefit from million recorded in fiscal compared to an expense of million recorded in fiscal the tax benefit for fiscal reflected tax benefits that became available to fmd as a result of the enactment in november of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of  or whbaa  offset by accruals related to unrecognized tax benefits 
tax expense for fiscal primarily reflected accruals related to unrecognized tax benefits  offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities 
a gain of million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal pursuant to the stipulation and the modified plan of reorganization 
total revenues decreased by million 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal was the result of a decline in net interest income of million  an increase of million in losses on trust updates for decreases in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fees and residuals  and a decrease of million of asset servicing fees  offset by an increase of million in administrative fees  primarily consisting of million of revenues recorded by tms 
we reported a net loss of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal the improvement from fiscal to fiscal was attributable to both an increase in revenues of million  resulting from lower valuation reductions to service revenue receivables  and to lower non interest expenses of million  resulting from lower general and administrative expenses and lower losses on education loans held for sale 
in addition  the net loss for fiscal reflected net losses of million attributable to ufsb spv  which was deconsolidated on july  with respect to our securitization trusts segment  the loss recorded for fiscal totaled million 
total revenues for fiscal reflected net interest income of million and a provision for loan losses of million 
total non interest expenses reflected general operating expenses of million  partially offset by a gain on the fair value adjustment to additional structural advisory fees due to our education financing segment of million 
the following sections provide more detail on the financial results of our reporting segments 
education financing in our education financing segment  we offer outsourcing services to national and regional financial and educational institutions for designing and implementing education loan programs 
we partner with lenders to design and service school certified loan programs  which are designed to be marketed through educational institutions or to prospective student borrowers and their families directly and to generate portfolios intended to 
table of contents be held by the originating lender or financed in the capital markets 
starting in fiscal  we began offering a fully integrated suite of services through our monogram platform  as well as certain services on a stand alone  fee for service basis 
as of january   we began offering outsourced tuition planning  tuition billing and payment technology services for universities  colleges and secondary schools through tms 
tms is one of the largest us providers of such services  operating in states and serving over schools 
tms provides students and their families with the opportunity to structure tuition payment plans that meet their financial needs while providing a broad array of tuition payment options 
we acquired tms  formerly a division of keybank  on december  see note  acquisition of tms  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for information on the pro forma financial results of our operations including tms as if the acquisition had occurred on july  we offer clients the opportunity to outsource key components of their education financing programs to us by offering the following services loan origination we offer loan processing services to schools and lenders  from application intake through loan disbursement 
we are able to customize our services to meet the specific branding  pricing and underwriting requirements of our clients 
tuition payment plans as of january   we have expanded our service offerings to include tuition planning  tuition billing and payment technology services for educational institutions 
portfolio management we manage education loan portfolios on behalf of their owners  including securitization trusts facilitated by us  by employing risk analytics to monitor and manage the performance of the portfolio over time 
as part of this service offering  we monitor portfolio performance metrics  manage the performance of third party vendors and interface with rating agencies 
our infrastructure enables comprehensive analytics  based on validated data  and we are able to customize collections strategies as needed to optimize loan performance 
trust administration as administrator for securitization trusts that we facilitated  we perform various administrative functions  including preparation of financial statements and monitoring of the performance of loan servicers and third party collection agencies 
we are responsible for reconciliation of funds among the third parties and the trusts  and we also provide regular reporting to investors in these securitization trusts as well as other related parties 
asset servicing our experience enables us to offer asset servicing such as residual analysis and valuation optimization services and strategies relating to asset funding to holders of a residual interest in education loan securitizations 
loan origination  portfolio management and trust administration services are each offered as an integrated part of our monogram platform or on a stand alone  fee for service basis 
tuition payment plans and asset servicing are offered on a stand alone  fee for service basis 
our monogram platform enables a lender to customize some or all of our service offerings based on its particular needs  including its risk control and return objectives 
specifically  in consultation with us  the lender can customize the range of loan terms offered to its qualified applicants  such as borrower repayment options  repayment terms and borrower pricing 
our monogram platform is based on our proprietary origination risk score model  which uses borrower and cosigner attributes  as well as distribution channel variables  to assign a specific level of credit risk to the application at the time of initial credit decisioning 
a score is assigned to each application and governs the loan terms and features offered to applicants who pass the credit review 
lenders may provide all loan repayment options to all applicants who pass the credit review or restrict repayment options based on applicants scores 
for example  higher risk applicants may not be eligible to defer principal and interest while in school 
our online application also provides a qualified applicant with some ability to configure loan terms  showing the financial effects of the choices using a real time repayment calculator 
a monogram based loan program can be structured so that lenders hold the education loans through the scheduled repayment  prepayment or default  or for some limited period of time before disposing of the loans in a capital markets 
table of contents transaction 
we believe that the education loans generated through our monogram platform will generally have shorter repayment periods and an increased percentage of borrowers making payments while in school  in each case when compared to loans generated under programs that we previously facilitated  as well as high cosigner participation rates 
the success of our monogram platform will be a key driver of our future financial results and will be critical to growing and diversifying our revenue and client base 
development of our monogram platform was completed in august  and the first education loans based on our monogram platform were disbursed during the first quarter of fiscal in connection with our initial three lenders monogram based loan programs  we have provided capital commitments to fund participation accounts or loss reserve accounts to serve as a first loss reserve for defaulted program loans 
we have made initial deposits toward our capital commitments and agreed to provide periodic supplemental deposits  up to specified limits  during the terms of our loan program agreements based on the credit mix and volume of disbursed program loans and adjustments to default projections for program loans 
to the extent that outstanding loan volume decreases as a result of repayments  or if actual loan volumes or default experience is less than our funded amounts  we would be eligible to receive periodic releases of funds 
the timing and amount of release are uncertain and vary among the lenders  and  in the case of union federal  may be subject to regulatory approval 
as consideration for providing the capital commitments  we are entitled to receive a share of the interest generated on the loans 
during fiscal  we funded capital commitments in the amount of million in support of our first two monogram based loan programs 
as of september   we have funded million in support of our monogram based loan programs for union federal  which was launched on june  we also include in our education financing segment the financial results of our bank subsidiary  union federal 
union federal is a federally chartered thrift that since july  has been regulated by the occ 
prior to july   union federal was regulated by the ots 
union federal offers residential and commercial mortgage loans and retail savings  money market and time deposit products 
on june   union federal launched the ufsb private student loan program  a monogram based national higher education loan program  and the prepgate loan program  a monogram based national k education loan program  and began accepting applications under these programs as of july  as a result of our ownership of union federal  fmd is a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve 
we also provide administrative and other services to securitization trusts that we facilitated and asset servicing to the third party owner of the trust certificate  which we sold in fiscal historically  the driver of our results of operations and financial condition for our education financing segment was the volume of education loans for which we provided outsourcing services from loan origination through securitization 
securitization refers to the technique of pooling education loans and selling them to a special purpose entity  typically a trust  which issues notes backed by those loans to investors 
for our past securitization services  we are entitled over time to receive additional structural advisory fees and residual cash flows from certain securitization trusts 
prior period financial results for our education financing segment do not include the financial results of ufsb spv  which we deconsolidated effective july   and has been presented separately in deconsolidation and eliminations for segment reporting purposes 

table of contents the following table presents the results of operations and summary of changes for our education financing segment fiscal years ended june  change between periods dollars in thousands revenues net interest income interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income loss after provision for loan losses non interest revenues asset servicing fees additional structural advisory fees and residuals trust updates administrative and other fees total non interest revenues total revenues total non interest expenses loss before other income and income taxes other income gain from teri settlement loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss net interest income for fiscal  net interest income after provision for loan losses declined to thousand from million in fiscal the decrease is a result of a net decrease in interest income of million offset by a decrease in expense of million 
the decrease in net interest income in fiscal of million reflects a decrease in our education loans held for sale following the sale of approximately of union federal s education loan portfolio in october loans held for sale generated million of interest income in fiscal to a lesser extent  we experienced a decline in interest expense  primarily on deposits  attributable both to lower interest rates and lower deposit volume 
see financial condition consolidated average balance sheet below for additional information on our consolidated average balance sheet and rates earned and paid 
net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in net interest income 
interest income from education loans held for sale decreased by million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the sale of approximately of union federal s education loan portfolio in october  and lower interest rates on loans  cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense also decreased million  principally as a result of lower deposit volume and rates paid on deposits and lower borrowing balances under the education loan warehouse facility in fiscal non interest revenues non interest revenues for our education financing segment includes asset servicing fees due from the third party owner of the trust certificate  stand alone fee for service revenues for loan origination  program support and other services due from unrelated third parties  and starting in fiscal  fees related to our monogram 
table of contents platform 
non interest revenues for fiscal also included million of revenues generated by tms during the six months following the acquisition completed on december  in addition  non interest revenues for our education financing segment included trust updates for additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables  as well as administration and other fees for services provided to securitization trusts that we facilitated  including those trusts that we consolidated effective july   prior to intercompany eliminations 
non interest revenues servicing fees and trust updates we record our service revenue receivables at fair value in our balance sheet 
asset servicing fee receivables represent the estimated fair value of service revenues earned as of our balance sheet date from the third party owner of the trust certificate 
additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables represent the estimated fair value of service revenue receivables expected to be collected over the life of the various separate securitization trusts that have purchased education loans facilitated by us  with no further service obligations on our part 
these trusts are primarily  but not limited to  the ncslt trusts 
in the absence of market based transactions  we use level cash flow modeling techniques to derive an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes 
changes in the estimated fair value of receivables due  less cash received  from the consolidated securitization trusts are recorded as revenue or loss  which we refer to as trust updates 
see note  service revenue receivables and related income education loan performance assessment and assumptions overview  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a description of the significant observable and unobservable inputs used to develop our fair value estimates  which include  but are not limited to  recovery  default and prepayment rates  discount rate  and the forward libor curve 
from a balance sheet perspective  our adoption of asc  consolidation  or asc  requires that many of these service revenue receivables and related fee income be eliminated in consolidation but separately recorded in our segment reporting disclosures in our education financing segment 
non interest revenues asset servicing fees in march  we entered into the asset services agreement with the third party owner of the trust certificate 
pursuant to the asset services agreement  we provide ongoing services  including analysis and valuation optimization and services relating to funding strategy  to support its ownership of certain residual interests of the trusts 
as compensation for our services  we are entitled to a monthly asset servicing fee  based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the education loans owned by the trusts  limited to the total cash flows expected to be generated by residuals 
although this fee is earned monthly  our right to receive the fee is contingent on distributions made to the holder of the trust certificate 
under no circumstance will we receive cash for our asset servicing fees until residual cash flows are distributed from the trusts 
our asset servicing fee receivables were million  million and million at june   june  and june   respectively  recorded at fair value in our balance sheet based on the estimated net present value of future cash flows 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million in fee income  respectively  which represented our estimate of the net present value of fees to be received for services specifically provided during those reporting periods 
for fiscal  we recognized fee update losses of million compared to fee update losses of million for fiscal the lower fee income and higher fee update losses in fiscal reflect reductions in our estimates of the amount of residual cash flows to be paid to the third party owner of the trust certificate  primarily due to a change in our assumed recovery rates on defaulted education loans 
fee update losses in fiscal reflect reductions in our estimates of the amount of residual cash flows  largely due to a change in our assumed default rates 

table of contents asset servicing fees in fiscal of million reflected only one fiscal quarter of fee income as a result of the asset servicing agreement becoming effective for the last fiscal quarter in fiscal non interest revenues additional structural advisory fee and residual trust updates a significant portion of additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables are due from the securitization trusts consolidated effective july  upon our adoption of asu and asu  which are eliminated in consolidation but continue to be recognized by our education financing segment for segment reporting purposes 
the following table summarizes changes in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivables recognized by our education financing segment fiscal years ended june  change between periods dollars in thousands fair value  beginning of period due from securitization trusts due from off balance sheet vies total additional structural advisory fee receivables  beginning of period cash received from trust distributions of off balance sheet vies trust updates securitization trusts trust updates off balance sheet vies fair value  end of period due from securitization trusts due from off balance sheet vies total additional structural advisory fee receivables  end of period the following table summarizes the details of trust updates to additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables fiscal years ended june  change between periods dollars in thousands trust updates additional structural advisory fees due from securitization trusts due from off balance sheet vies total additional structural advisory fee trust updates residuals due from off balance sheet vies due from securitization trusts total residual trust updates total trust updates education financing 
table of contents additional structural advisory fees 
the decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivables during fiscal was primarily related to the decreases in our net recovery rate assumptions at march  the changes to our assumptions reduced the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fees due from consolidated securitization trusts by million during fiscal for fiscal  losses were partially offset by gains recorded earlier in the fiscal year related to a decrease in our discount rate assumptions and accretion for the passage of time 
losses recorded during fiscal reflected increases to our discount rate and default rate assumptions  partially offset by a lower prepayment rate assumption 
the changes in our assumptions resulted from enhancements we made in the third quarter of fiscal to the financial models that we use to estimate the fair value of our service revenue receivables 
these enhancements provided for the inclusion of certain prospective macroeconomic factors in our default and prepayment assumptions for those education loans securitized in the trusts 
in addition  we developed the ability to provide performance information on a segmented basis rather than merely on a weighted average basis 
as a result  during fiscal  we increased our projected overall end point default rates  and decreased our overall projected prepayment rates  which had the effect of lengthening the term over which we are entitled to receive additional structural advisory fees 
due to the longer term of the fees  we determined that it was appropriate to apply a higher discount rate 
for fiscal  we recorded losses for additional advisory fees trust updates of million reflecting an increase in the assumed discount rate  net default rates and auction rate note spreads  as well as a decrease in the forward libor curve 
residuals 
at june   education financing residual receivables were million  of which million was due from the gate trusts included in our securitization trusts segment and million was due from off balance sheet vies 
we did not receive any cash distribution from any residual interest in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal trust update losses of million for fiscal reflected losses recorded in the first quarter due to the general performance of off balance sheet vies  in part offset by gains in the second quarter and a decrease in the discount rate used for off balance sheet vies for which the performance characteristics and shorter estimated weighted average lives of the trusts indicated a lower discount rate was appropriate 
gains of million for fiscal reflected a decrease in the discount rate from to  in addition to accretion and an increase in the forward libor curve 
trust update losses on residuals were million for fiscal the loss reflected  in part  valuation adjustments primarily related to higher default and discount rate assumptions  higher interest rates on auction rate notes and a decrease in the forward libor curve  partially offset by accretion for the passage of time and lower assumed prepayment rates 
in addition  we recorded a loss of million to reflect a reduction in the carrying value of trust residuals due to the sale of the trust certificate 
non interest revenues administrative and other fees administrative and other fees for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
tms revenue during fiscal largely offset declines in origination services not related to our monogram platform during this period 
administrative and other fees for fiscal reflect million of fee revenue from tms operations 
the remaining million of fees for fiscal are primarily attributable to fees for trust administration and default prevention and management services provided to the securitization trusts facilitated by us  including million of fees from our securitization trusts segment for fiscal  as well as loan origination fees for services provided to unrelated third parties 
the fee based income excluding tms was relatively consistent  representing a million decline from fiscal to fiscal fees in fiscal decreased by a net million over fiscal 
table of contents non interest expenses the following table reflects non interest expenses for our education financing segment fiscal years ended june  change between periods dollars in thousands compensation and benefits general and administrative expenses third party services depreciation and amortization occupancy and equipment servicer fees other total general and administrative expenses losses on education loans held for sale total non interest expenses total number of full and part time employees at fiscal year end compensation and benefits expenses 
compensation and benefits expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of lower stock based compensation expense and lower incentive compensation offset by an increase in headcount 
headcount increased in fiscal as a result of the tms acquisition 
compensation and benefits expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase related to the higher cost of stock based compensation for restricted stock units granted during the year  largely offset by the lower cost of benefits and lower severance costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease of million is a result of lower depreciation and amortization expenses for certain fixed assets that were fully depreciated  and lower occupancy costs due to sub lease losses recorded in the prior year and lower on going rent expense in the current year  offset by an increase in expenses attributable to tms 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million  reflecting continued cost cutting and efficiency efforts 
expenses decreased across every category  except occupancy expense which reflected a charge related to unoccupied space in the amount of million taken in fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses decreased due to the retirement of certain fixed assets 
lower third party service costs reflect the reduced use of consultants and outside counsel as outstanding litigation was resolved 
other expenses decreased due to lower goodwill impairment charges and lower marketing expenses 
losses on education loans held for sale 
we did not have any education loans held for sale during fiscal we recorded losses on education loans held for sale of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  union federal sold education loans held for sale to an unaffiliated third party for million 
we recorded an unrealized loss of million during the first quarter of fiscal on all education loans held for sale based on the price we received from a third party for the loans 
in addition to the sale  we recorded additional net unrealized losses of million during fiscal our estimates of fair value of the education loans held for sale at june  were based on our cash flow model  which reflected increases in assumptions for default rates and lower recovery rates  similar to the deterioration in performance experienced by the securitization trusts we facilitated 
other income gain from teri settlement 
in april  teri filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  which we refer to as the teri reorganization 
our education 
table of contents financing segment recorded a gain of million during fiscal due to resolution of certain matters related to the teri reorganization 
this gain represented the forgiveness of notes payable and other liabilities  and cash distributions from the liquidating trust under the modified plan of reorganization 
june  education financing dollars in thousands cash received in excess of recorded receivables reversal of recorded liabilities total other income gain from teri settlement income taxes our effective income tax rate is calculated on a consolidated basis 
the securitization trusts are considered pass through entities for income tax purposes and  accordingly  the net income or loss of the trusts is included in the tax returns of the trust owners rather than the trust entities themselves 
as such  we record all income tax benefit or expense in our education financing segment 
we are subject to federal income tax  as well as income tax in multiple us state and local jurisdictions 
the irs has begun an audit of our tax returns for the taxable years   and in addition  we are involved in several matters before the atb relating to the massachusetts tax treatment of gate  a former subsidiary of fmd 
see item  legal proceedings  and note  commitments and contingencies income tax matters  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information regarding these matters 
our state income tax returns in jurisdictions other than massachusetts remain subject to examination for various fiscal years ending between june  and june  income tax expense was million in fiscal  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal due to enactment of the whbaa  described below  we recorded an income tax benefit for certain losses in fiscal  as the legislation permitted the carryback of these losses to offset taxable income in earlier periods 
beginning in fiscal  we no longer had any carryback to offset taxable income in prior periods 
as a result  we recorded a net operating loss carryforward asset as of june   for which we recorded a full valuation allowance 
the net effect is that we had no tax expense or benefit from our operating losses for fiscal  and we recorded accruals related to unrecognized tax benefits 
the lower overall benefit in fiscal when compared to fiscal was a result of lower pre tax losses during fiscal in november  the whbaa was signed into law 
under the whbaa  we were permitted to carryback the taxable losses from either fiscal or for five years instead of two years 
we filed our fiscal tax return and elected to carry that taxable loss back for five years 
as a result of the whbaa and pre existing net operating loss carryback rules  we recorded an income tax receivable at september  of million  which was received on october  under current law  we do not have remaining taxes paid within available net operating loss carryback periods  and it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized through future reversals of existing temporary differences or available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary for all of our deferred tax assets not scheduled to reverse against existing deferred tax liabilities as of june  and june  we will continue to review the recognition of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
securitization trusts results of operations for our securitization trusts segment include the securitization trusts consolidated as of july  financial results for our securitization trusts segment are only presented prospectively  as of the effective date of our adoption 
interest income  net of any amortization of loan acquisition costs  is generated 
table of contents on the education loan portfolios held by the consolidated securitization trusts included in our securitization trusts segment  and interest expense relates to the debt issued by these trusts to finance the purchase of education loans 
general and administrative expenses include amounts paid to our education financing segment for additional structural advisory fees  trust administration and default prevention and collections management  as well as collection costs and trust expenses paid to unrelated third parties 
our consolidated securitization trusts are managed in accordance with their applicable indentures  and their tangible assets are limited to cash  allowable investments  and education loan principal  as well as the related interest income receivables and recoverables on defaulted loans 
liabilities are limited to the debt issued to finance the education loans purchased and payables accrued in the normal course of operations  all of which have been structured to be non recourse to the general credit of fmd 
the majority of our consolidated securitization trusts are ncslt trusts  for which we have no ownership interest 
although the cumulative deficit of these trusts is reflected in our consolidated accumulated deficit  the financial performance of such trusts will ultimately inure to the third party owners of the residual interests  and any deficit generated by a consolidated trust will reverse out of our accumulated deficit or retained earnings  and be recorded as a non cash gain  when the trust s liabilities are extinguished or the trust is deconsolidated by us 
as a result  the financial performance of the ncslt trusts does not directly impact the long term equity available to our stockholders  but the financial performance of all of the trusts  both on and off balance sheet  impacts the ability of our education financing segment to recover service revenue receivables due from these trusts and the third party owner of the trust certificate 
the remaining three consolidated securitization trusts are gate trusts  for which we own of the residual interests 
to the extent that the gate trusts have residual cash flows  profits will ultimately be realized by our stockholders when those residual payments are made  however  if cash flows of these trusts were insufficient to pay off the long term borrowings and other legal obligations of the trusts  our stockholders would not be responsible for those losses 
the ncslt trusts hold education loans that were formerly subject to a loan repayment guaranty by teri 
in addition  one of our consolidated gate trusts holds a limited number of loans that were formerly teri guaranteed 
under the modified plan of reorganization  which became effective in the second quarter of fiscal  teri rejected its guaranty agreements and settled claims with the securitization trusts  including contingent guaranty claims based on future loan defaults 
as a result  our securitization trusts segment recognized gains of million  as more fully described in note  other income gain from teri settlement  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the teri reorganization  combined with higher levels of defaults than we initially projected  has had a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our securitization trusts segment 
the following table reflects the financial results of our securitization trusts segment for fiscal dollars in thousands revenues net interest income interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest loss after provision for loan losses administrative and other fees total revenues total general and administrative expenses loss before gain from teri settlement other income gain from teri settlement net loss 
table of contents net interest income for fiscal  net interest income for our securitization trusts segment was million 
net interest income from our securitization trusts segment is generated by education loans held to maturity and  to a lesser extent  interest earned on restricted cash and guaranteed investment contracts 
interest income on education loans held to maturity is primarily generated by variable rate loans  indexed to the one month libor rate  adjusted for the amortization of loan acquisition costs and origination fees  using the effective interest method 
interest expense relates to the interest paid on long term borrowings used to finance the purchase of education loans  which are primarily variable rate notes indexed to the one month libor rate and  to a lesser extent  interest only securities that bear a fixed interest rate based on contractual notional principal values over the period they are outstanding  adjusted for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance and underwriting costs and the proceeds from interest only strips  using the effective interest method

see financial condition consolidated average balance sheet below for additional information on our consolidated average balance sheet and rates earned and paid 
long term borrowings in our consolidated average balance sheet relate only to our securitization trusts segment  and consolidated education loans held to maturity are almost entirely related to our securitization trusts segment 
see financial condition restricted cash and guaranteed investment contracts below for additional information 
provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for fiscal for the education loans held by our securitization trusts segment 
the allowance for loan losses is adjusted for credit losses through a charge to a provision for loan losses 
see financial condition loans below for a discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the implied credit quality of the related loans 
general and administrative expenses the following table presents general and administrative expenses for fiscal dollars in thousands general and administrative expenses additional structural advisory fees trust updates due to education financing trust administration and default prevention and collections management fees due to education financing servicer fees trust collection costs and other trust expenses total general and administrative expenses the consolidated securitization trusts carry liabilities for additional structural advisory fees due to our education financing segment at fair value in our balance sheet before elimination entries 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflect a gain of million due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of the liability for additional structural advisory fees payable 
the decrease in the fair value of the liability is primarily attributable to the lower net recovery rate assumptions for defaulted education loans 
this gain and the loss recorded in revenues by our education financing segment are eliminated in consolidation 
see note  service revenue receivables and related income education loan performance assessment and assumptions overview  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a discussion of the determination of additional structural advisory fees trust updates 
trust administration fees are based on the volume of education loans outstanding 
our securitization trusts segment recognizes default prevention and collections management expenses based  in part  on the actual 
table of contents expenses incurred by our subsidiary fmer  in its capacity as special servicer  and in part on the dollar volume of education loans outstanding 
fmer s reimbursement for expenses as special servicer is capped at monthly and aggregate amounts  and fmer s financial results are included in our education financing segment 
servicer fees are based on the dollar volume of education loans outstanding 
trust collection costs vary with the collection activities pursued on defaulted loans 
other securitization trust expenses are generally fixed indenture costs 
other income gain from teri settlement 
our securitization trusts segment recorded gains during fiscal as a result of the resolution of certain matters related to the teri reorganization 
these gains represented the transfer of assets to the trusts in excess of their recorded receivables  the forgiveness of guaranty fees and other liabilities and cash distributions from the liquidating trust under the modified plan of reorganization

ufsb spv was deconsolidated on july  with our adoption of asu and asu for fiscal  the revenues and expenses included in deconsolidation and eliminations for segment reporting purposes represented the financial results of ufsb spv  as well as related adjustments to deferred tax assets and intercompany eliminations that were recorded due to consolidation of ufsb spv in prior periods 
the financial results of ufsb spv have been separately presented in deconsolidation and eliminations for segment reporting purposes to allow for comparability between periods 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on our historical experience  economic conditions and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements to be a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 

table of contents we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
as a result of our adoption of new accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal  we re evaluated which policies were deemed to be critical accounting policies 
we determined that our judgments and estimates regarding the following constitute critical accounting policies whether or not to consolidate the financial results of a vie  allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses  recognition of interest income on delinquent and defaulted loans  recognition of asset servicing fees and trust updates to our service revenue receivables  the determination of goodwill and intangible asset impairment  and income taxes 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of fmd  its subsidiaries and certain vies  as applicable  after eliminating intercompany accounts and transactions 
prior to july   we did not consolidate the financial results of any securitization trusts purchasing education loans that we facilitated because each of the securitization trusts met the criteria to be a qspe  as defined by asc prior to july   a qspe was exempt from consolidation 
effective july   we adopted asu and asu asu removed the concept of a qspe from asc and removed the exemption from consolidation for a qspe from asc asu updated asc to require that enterprises perform analyses to determine if they are the primary beneficiary of a vie 
a primary beneficiary of a vie is an enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that vie s economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie 
as a result  on july   we consolidated securitization trusts facilitated by us because we determined that our services related to default prevention and collections management  for which we can only be removed for cause  combined with the variability that we absorb as part of our securitization fee structure  made us the primary beneficiary of those trusts 
in addition  we deconsolidated ufsb spv because we determined that we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact ufsb spv s economic performance 
in addition  asu requires us to continuously reassess whether consolidation of a vie is appropriate  as opposed to the trigger based assessment under previous guidance 
as a result  we continually reassess our involvement with each vie in which we have an interest  both on and off balance sheet  and our determination of whether consolidation or deconsolidation of a vie is appropriate 
we monitor matters related to our ability to control economic performance  such as contractual changes in the services we provide  the extent of our ownership and the rights of third parties to terminate us as a service provider 
in addition  we monitor the financial performance of each vie for indications that we may or may not have the right to absorb benefits or the obligation to absorb losses associated with variability in the financial performance of the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie 
if  for any reason  we determine that we can no longer be considered the primary beneficiary  we would be required to deconsolidate the vie 
deconsolidation of a vie is accounted for in the same manner as the sale of a subsidiary  with a gain or loss recorded in our statement of operations to the extent that proceeds  if any  are more or less than the net assets of the vie 
our determination to consolidate or deconsolidate vies may lead to increased volatility in our financial results and make comparisons between time periods challenging 
in addition to monitoring each consolidated vie  we monitor our involvement with other off balance sheet vies for which we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary due to the sole  unilateral rights of other parties to terminate us in our role as service provider or due to a lack of obligation on our part to absorb 
table of contents benefits or losses of the vie that would be significant to that vie 
significant changes to the pertinent rights of other parties or significant changes to the ranges of possible financial performance outcomes used in our assessment of the variability of cash flows due to us could cause us to change our determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated in future periods 
asu and asu were applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit at the effective date 
assets and liabilities of the consolidated vies were measured as if they had been consolidated at the time we became the primary beneficiary 
all intercompany transactions were eliminated 
see note  consolidation  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
effective with our consolidation of vies  our non interest revenues no longer reflect the additional structural advisory fees trust updates and administrative and other fees due from the consolidated vies  but continues to reflect such fees due from other off balance sheet vies 
we do not recognize gains or losses related to the residual receivables due from the three consolidated gate trusts in our consolidated statement of operations  but we do recognize revaluation gains and losses on residual receivables from each off balance sheet vie 
we recognize interest income associated with securitized assets of the consolidated securitization trusts in the same line item as interest income from non securitized assets  and we recognize interest expense associated with debt issued by the consolidated securitization trusts to third party investors on the same line item as other interest bearing liabilities of fmd 
education loans held to maturity and the related allowance for loan losses  provision for loan losses and charge offs we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our portfolios of loans held to maturity at our balance sheet date  based on a one year loss confirmation period 
the allowance for loan losses is increased through charges to the provision for loan losses in our statement of operations  and reduced by net charge offs of loans deemed uncollectible 
inherent credit losses include losses for loans in default that have not been charged off and loans that are probable of default  less any amounts expected to be recoverable from a borrower or a third party  over the confirmation period 
we consider an education loan to be in default when it is days past due as to either principal or interest  based on the timing of cash receipts from the borrower 
we use projected cash flows to determine the allowance amount deemed necessary for education loans with a probability of default at our balance sheet date 
we base such default estimates on a loss confirmation period of one year  which we believe to be the approximate amount of time that it would take a loss inherent in the education loan portfolio at our balance sheet date to ultimately default and be charged off 
the estimate used in the calculation of the allowance for education loan losses is subject to a number of assumptions  including default and recovery rates  the effect of basic forbearance and alternative payment plans available to borrowers and the appropriateness of assessing both quantitative and qualitative factors 
these assumptions are principally the same as those used for the estimated fair value of our service revenue receivables  as described more fully below under service revenue receivables and the related revenues education loan performance and other assumptions 
these assumptions are based on the status of education loans at our balance sheet date  as well as macroeconomic indicators and our historical experience 
if actual future loan performance were to differ significantly from the assumptions used  the impact on the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses for education loans recorded in our statement of operations could be material 
effective beginning the second quarter of fiscal  we began charging off an education loan in the month immediately subsequent to the month in which it becomes days past due 
during the first quarter of fiscal  based on the guaranty claims process for teri guaranteed loans  we charged off an education loan in the month immediately subsequent to the month in which it became days past due 
following the rejection by teri of its guaranty agreements under the modified plan of reorganization  we modified our charge off policy 
charge offs are recorded as both a decrease in the outstanding principal of the education loan and a decrease in the allowance for loan losses  and  therefore  the change in our charge off policy did not have an impact on our statement of operations 
we record cash recoveries on charged off loans as an increase to the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents recognition of interest income on education loans we recognize interest income using the effective interest method 
we recognize interest income on education loans as earned  adjusted for the amortization of loan acquisition costs and origination fees  based on the expected yield of the loan over its life  which includes the effect of expected prepayments 
our estimate of the effects of expected prepayments on education loans reflects voluntary prepayments based on our historical experience and macroeconomic indicators 
when changes to assumptions occur  we adjust amortization on a cumulative basis to reflect the change since acquisition of the education loan portfolio 
we place education loans held to maturity on non accrual status when they become days past due as to either principal or interest  or earlier when full collection of principal or interest is not considered probable 
when we place an education loan on non accrual status  we discontinue the accrual of interest  and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against interest revenues 
for education loans on non accrual status but not yet charged off  we recognize interest revenues on a cash basis 
if a borrower makes payments sufficient to become current on principal and interest prior to being charged off  or cures the education loan delinquency  we remove the loan from non accrual status and recommence recognizing interest revenues 
once a loan has been charged off  we apply any payments made by the borrower to outstanding principal  and we only record income on a cash basis when all principal has been recovered 
service revenue receivables and the related revenues asset servicing fees we are entitled to receive asset servicing fees from the third party owner of the trust certificate for services that we provide on an ongoing basis 
we earn asset servicing fees as the services are performed  however  our receipt of the fees is contingent on distributions from the trusts available to the third party owner of the trust certificate 
we record asset servicing fee income at fair value  based on the estimated present value of the fees earned during the reporting period  and we record changes in the estimated fair value of fees earned in prior periods as asset servicing fee updates 
asset servicing fees are based on the outstanding assets of the trusts  and our receipt of such fees is contingent on the performance of the trusts  a number of which we consolidate 
the fees  however  are due from the third party owner of the trust certificate for services performed on its behalf  and as such  we do not eliminate these fees in consolidation 
additional structural advisory fees and residuals we have historically structured and facilitated securitization transactions for our clients through a series of special purpose statutory trusts 
in connection with its prior securitization activities  our education financing segment is entitled to receive additional structural advisory fees over the lives of the trusts from the majority of securitization trusts that we facilitated  based on the amount of education loans outstanding in the trusts from time to time 
for certain trusts  our education financing segment is also entitled to residual interests 
the majority of our additional structural advisory fees and a significant portion of our residuals are due from consolidated securitization trusts and are eliminated upon consolidation 
we have no ownership interest in the trusts  but the financial performance of the trusts  both the ncslt trusts and off balance sheet trusts  impacts the ability of our education financing segment to recover service revenue receivables due from the trusts and the third party owner of the trust certificate 
accordingly  we continue to report additional structural advisory fees and residuals trust updates  prior to elimination  under education financing in our segment results 
we recognized the fair value of additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables as revenue at the time the securitization trust purchased the education loans  but before we actually received payment  as these revenues were deemed to be earned at the time of the securitization 
these amounts were deemed earned at securitization because i evidence of an arrangement existed  ii we provided the services  iii the fee was fixed 
table of contents and determinable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  and iv there were no future contingencies or obligations due on our part 
on a quarterly basis  we update our estimate of the fair value of these receivables as if they are investments in securities classified as trading 
we recognize changes in fair value  less cash received  if any  as trust updates in servicing revenues in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
education loan performance and other assumptions because there are no quoted market prices for our service revenue receivables  we use discounted cash flow modeling techniques and the following key assumptions to estimate fair value expected annual rate and timing of education loan defaults  including the effects of various risk mitigation strategies  such as basic forbearance programs and alternative payment plans  expected amount and timing of recoveries of defaulted education loans  discount rate  which we use to calculate the present value of our future cash flows  trend of interest rates over the life of the loan pool  including the forward libor curve and expected auction rates  if applicable  annual rate and timing of education loan prepayments  and fees and expenses of the securitization trusts 
we base our estimates on certain macroeconomic indicators and our historical experience adjusted for specific product and borrower characteristics such as loan type and borrower creditworthiness 
we monitor trends in education loan performance over time and make adjustments we believe are necessary to value properly our service revenue receivables at each balance sheet date 
management s ability to determine which factors should be more heavily weighted in our estimates  and our ability to accurately incorporate those factors into our loan performance assumptions and projections  can have a material effect on our valuations 
see note  service revenue receivables and related income education loan performance assessment and assumptions overview  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for information on the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value 
review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on december   we completed our acquisition of the assets  liabilities and operations of tms  formerly a division of keybank 
the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets are million and million at june  goodwill is required to be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets acquired consist of customer lists  technology  and tradename 
the values of these intangible assets were estimated using valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow analysis 
these intangible assets are being amortized over the period the assets are expected to contribute to our cash flows 
these intangible assets are subject to impairment tests in accordance with gaap  generally  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the operations of tms to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of tms exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a further analysis is required to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
there are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of tms  including assumptions regarding the estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities  customer relationships  the value of existing customer contracts  the value of other intangible assets  as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party would be willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of tms 
the calculation also requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and an appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at a final fair value 
since the business is not publically traded  and often there is not comparable market data available  there is a higher degree of judgment applied and the use 
table of contents of cash flows is weighted more heavily than the use of market multiples 
in the event that we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on our financial position 
for fiscal  we recorded no goodwill impairment 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment at our annual impairment testing date of may income taxes certain areas of accounting for income taxes require management s judgment  including determining the adequacy of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
judgments are made regarding various tax positions  which are often subjective and involve assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
if actual factors and conditions differ materially from estimates made by management  the actual realization of liabilities for uncertain tax positions could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded 
deferred tax assets arise from items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income to which refund claims could be carried back 
valuation allowances are recorded against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment 
they generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or a deduction taken on our tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in our financial statements 
financial condition cash  cash equivalents and investments we had combined cash  cash equivalents  federal funds sold  short term investments and investments available for sale of million and million  at june  and june   respectively 
of this total  fmd and its non bank subsidiaries held interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits  money market funds and certificates of deposit of million with highly rated financial institutions at june  union federal held a total of million in interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits and money market funds with highly rated financial institutions  federal funds sold and investments in federal agency mortgage backed securities at june  assets of union federal are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends without prior approval from the occ  as successor to the ots 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal is largely attributable to a million decrease in deposits at union federal  the acquisition of tms for million  and the funding of our operations  which were partially offset by million in federal income tax refunds 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information 
restricted cash and guaranteed investment contracts at june   restricted cash and guaranteed investment contracts in our balance sheet included cash and investments held by consolidated securitization trusts of million  restricted cash held by tms of million and restricted cash held by fmd and its other non bank subsidiaries of million 
the use of cash and investments held by securitization trusts is restricted to making payments for trust expenses  interest payments and principal paydowns on the debt of the particular trust holding the cash and guaranteed investment contracts  and is not available to any other securitization trust  fmd or any other subsidiary of fmd 
the investment of cash held by each trust is subject to the investment guidelines established in the applicable indenture 
restricted cash held by tms represents tuition payments collected from students or their families on behalf of educational institutions 
the cash is held in trust on behalf of our clients in a highly rated depository institution 
restricted cash held by our other subsidiaries relates to recoveries on defaulted education loans collected on behalf of clients and undistributed loan proceeds 
these funds are maintained in segregated bank accounts with highly rated depository institutions 
we classify changes in the balances of restricted cash and guaranteed investment contracts as investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents investments available for sale investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value at our balance sheet date 
available for sale investments consisted of mortgage backed federal agency securities held by union federal  with gross unrealized gains of thousand and thousand at june  and june   respectively  recognized in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders deficit 
loans at june   we classified all education loans and substantially all mortgage loans as held to maturity 
at june   our consolidated financial statements included a portfolio of education loans held for sale by ufsb spv  which was deconsolidated effective july  in connection with our adoption of asu and asu the net carrying value of loans consisted of the following  as of the dates indicated june  dollars in thousands education loans held to maturity mortgage loans held to maturity education loans held for sale ufsb spv education loans held to maturity almost all education loans held to maturity at june  were held by the securitizations trusts that we consolidated effective july  through the securitization process  these special purpose statutory trusts purchased education loans from the originating lenders or their assignees  which relinquished to the trusts their ownership interest in the education loans 
the debt instruments issued by the securitization trusts to finance the purchase of these education loans are collateralized by the purchased loan portfolios 
the majority of the loans held by our securitization trusts segment are held by the ncslt trusts and were formerly guaranteed by teri 
generally  the gate trusts hold education loans that were not guaranteed by teri  but benefit from other credit enhancement arrangements from the borrowers educational institutions or with a lender that has provided a guaranty on behalf of certain educational institutions  up to specified limits 
education loans held to maturity at june  consisted of loans originated by union federal that we were unable to securitize 
these loans were originally classified as held for sale because we were actively seeking a buyer or an opportunity to securitize them 
during the third quarter of fiscal  these loans were sold by union federal to one of our non bank subsidiaries and upon sale were reclassified as held to maturity 
these loans are not subject to collateral restrictions or otherwise encumbered 
the following table summarizes the composition of the net carrying value of our education loans held to maturity june  dollars in thousands education loans held to maturity gross loan principal outstanding net unamortized loan acquisition costs and origination fees gross loans outstanding allowance for loan losses education loans held to maturity  net of allowance principal outstanding of loans serving as collateral for long term borrowings

under the terms of a majority of the education loans held by our securitization trusts  a borrower is eligible to defer principal and interest payments while carrying a specified academic course load and may be eligible to defer payments for an additional six months after graduation during a grace period 
either quarterly or at the end of the deferment period  depending on the terms of the loan agreement  any accrued but unpaid interest is capitalized and added to principal outstanding 
with respect to our consolidated securitization trusts  we expect the number of borrowers in deferment status to decline in the future because we do not expect to add new loans to the portfolios of the consolidated securitization trusts 
forbearance 
under the terms of the education loans  a borrower may apply for forbearance  which is a temporary reprieve from making full contractual payments 
forbearance can take many forms  at the option of the creditor 
the most common forms of forbearance include the following basic forbearance cessation of all contractual payments for a maximum allowable forbearance period of one year  granted in three month increments 
alternative payment plans under alternative payment plans  a borrower can make a reduced payment for a limited period of time 
the amount of the payment varies under different programs available and may be set at a fixed dollar amount  a percentage of contractual required payments or interest only payments 
generally  approval for alternative payment plans is granted for a maximum of six to months  depending on the program 
under both basic forbearance and alternative payment plans  the education loan continues to accrue interest 
when forbearance ceases  unpaid interest is capitalized and added to principal outstanding  and the borrower s required payments are recalculated at a higher amount to pay off the loan  plus the additional accrued and capitalized interest  at the original stated interest rate by the original maturity date 
there is no forgiveness of principal or interest  reduction in the interest rate or extension of the maturity date 

table of contents forbearance programs result in a delay in the timing of payments received from borrowers  but at the same time  assuming the collection of the forborne amounts  provide for an increase in the gross volume of cash receipts over the term of the education loan due to the additional accrued interest capitalized while in forbearance 
forbearance programs may have the effect of delaying default emergence  and alternative payment plans may reduce the utilization of basic forbearance 
in repayment 
we determine the repayment status of a borrower  including a borrower making payments pursuant to alternative payment plans  by contractual due dates 
a borrower making reduced payments for a limited period of time pursuant to an alternative payment plan will be considered current if such reduced payments are timely made 
over the last twelve months  we have seen a decline in the balance of education loans in deferment from billion  or of gross loan principal outstanding at july   to million  or at june  loans in basic forbearance have declined from million to million over the same period 
the following table provides additional information on the status of education loans outstanding june  as a percentage of total dollars in thousands principal of loans outstanding in basic forbearance in school deferment in repayment  including alternative payment plans  classified as current days past due delinquent days past due  but days past due delinquent days past due  but days past due in default days past due  but not charged off total gross loan principal outstanding non accrual loan principal days past due past due loan principal days  but days past due still accruing interest end of period allowance as a percentage of gross loan principal outstanding at june   borrowers in repayment with loan principal outstanding of approximately billion were making reduced payments under alternative payment plans

table of contents ratios for the twelve months ended june  are on an annualized basis 
charge off ratios for the twelve months ended june  exclude charge offs of million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal that relate to charge offs that would have been recorded in fiscal if we had adopted our charge off policy in that fiscal year 
charge off ratios for the twelve months ended june  also exclude million of charge offs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal that resulted from the change in our charge off policy 
we began charging off at days rather than days in the second quarter of fiscal including the million of charge offs recorded in the second fiscal quarter and the million of charge offs recorded in the first fiscal quarter  the net annualized charge offs as a percentage of average loan principal in repayment would have been for the twelve months ended june  management monitors the credit quality of an education loan based on loan status  as outlined above 
the impact of changes in loan status  such as delinquency and time in repayment  are incorporated into the allowance for loan loss calculation quarterly through our projection of defaults 
we also utilize risk segments for the ncslt trusts 
the education loans in this portfolio are scored and placed into three segments using our propriety risk score modeling  origination data and additional credit bureau information made available at origination 
see note  service revenue receivables and related income education loan performance assessment and assumptions overview  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
at june   the allowance for loan losses included a specific allowance for education loans greater than days past due  but not yet charged off  of million 
in addition  we established a general allowance of million for estimated projected defaults  net of recoveries and third party guarantees  for the twelve months following our balance sheet date  which we refer to as the confirmation period 
to estimate defaults for the first six months of the confirmation period  we applied delinquency roll rates to education loans currently past due 
we based the applied roll rates on roll rates that we observed over the preceding months 
for the second six months of the confirmation period  we based net default projections on default and recovery rates determined using the same models used in our estimates of the fair value of service receivables 
we based our default and recovery curves on macroeconomic indicators and our historical observations 
see note  service revenue receivables and related income education loan performance assessment and assumptions overview  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for more information on default and recovery rates 
education loans held for sale education loans held for sale at june  consisted solely of the education loans held by ufsb spv  which was deconsolidated as a result of our adoption of asu and asu  effective july  we classified these loans as held for sale because they are pledged as collateral to the indenture trustee  for the benefit of the third party conduit lender under the education loan warehouse facility  and the lender has the right to call the loans at any time  therefore  we did not have the ability to hold these loans to maturity 
the facility has been structured to limit the conduit lender s recourse to the assets pledged as collateral  which consists almost exclusively of the education loans 
we carried education loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the absence of a readily determined market value  fair value was estimated by management based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the education loans 
management based its estimates of future cash flows on macroeconomic indicators and historical experience with assumptions for  among other things  default rates  recovery rates on defaulted loans  prepayment rates and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we recorded changes in the carrying value of loans held for sale and the related interest receivable in our statement of operations 

table of contents mortgage loans held to maturity through our bank subsidiary  union federal  we carry a held to maturity portfolio of mortgage loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses for our mortgage loan portfolio held to maturity on a specific identification basis when the loan becomes days past due or the borrower makes modified payments 
we set the allowance for loan losses at an amount believed to be adequate so that the net carrying value of the mortgage loan does not exceed the net realizable value of the collateral 
in addition  we establish a general allowance for loan losses for mortgage loans less than days past due based upon certain characteristics attributable to the collateral 
a mortgage loan for which we have foreclosed on the property and the related allowance is reclassified to other real estate owned  a component of other assets  and is carried at estimated net realizable value 
we do not have any mortgage loan greater than days past due that is accruing interest 
goodwill intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
in connection with our acquisition of tms  we recorded other intangible assets related to the tms customer list and tradename  each of which we amortize on a straight line basis over years  and technology  which we amortize on a straight line basis over six years 
we amortize core deposit intangible assets of union federal over five years 
we record amortization in general and administrative expenses 
the customer list intangible asset at june  related to educational institutions with which tms had existing tuition programs in place as of december  that were not sold as part of the sale to facts management of a portion of k school contracts on june   as described further below 
the tradename intangible asset related to the name and reputation of tms in the tuition payment management industry 
intangible assets attributable to technology represented the replacement cost of software and systems acquired that are necessary to support operations  net of an obsolescence factor 
goodwill represented the value ascribed to the business that cannot be separately ascribed to a tangible or intangible asset 
our acquisition of tms was completed on december   and  accordingly  our consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended december  did not reflect any income or expense from the operations of tms 
on june   tms sold a portfolio of contracts with k schools to facts management for a purchase price up to million 
as a result of the sale  we reduced goodwill and intangible assets allocable to the transaction in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
concurrently with the sale  tms entered into a transition services agreement with facts management to service the school contracts sold through the academic year 
as a result of the transition services agreement  we recorded a loss on the sale of thousand 
contractual obligations our consolidated contractual obligations include commitments under operating leases and the long term borrowings of the consolidated securitization trusts 
contractual obligations no longer include the education loan warehouse facility of ufsb spv  which was deconsolidated effective july   upon our adoption of asu and asu the following table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations by period at june  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands long term borrowings operating lease obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents through the securitization process  the consolidated securitization trusts issued debt instruments to finance the purchase of education loans obtained from originating lenders or their assignees 
the debt securities issued are obligations of the trusts 
holders of these debt securities generally have recourse only to the assets of the particular trust that issued the debt and not to any other securitization trusts  fmd  its operating subsidiaries or the originating lenders or their assignees 
the debt obligations are shown in the period corresponding to their original scheduled maturity

we expect to collect million in sublease revenue over the term of this sublease 
in addition  effective july   we entered into an amendment to reduce our rented space in our medford  massachusetts location by approximately  square feet  which results in a savings of million over the term of the lease 
the contractual obligations table does not reflect any sublease revenues from the subleases of our boston locations or savings from the reduction in our rented space in medford  massachusetts 
total stockholders equity deficit effective july   upon our adoption of asu and asu  we recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this amount represented the net deficit attributable to the consolidated securitization trusts  including million for the ncslt trusts  as well as the reversal of residual interests recognized in prior periods for entities consolidated  partially offset by deconsolidation of the net deficit of ufsb spv and the reversal of certain related deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
total stockholders equity at june  included in accumulated deficit the deficit of the ncslt trusts of billion  which will never be realized by our stockholders because we have no ownership interest in these trusts 
off balance sheet arrangements we offer outsourcing services in connection with education loan programs  from program design through securitization of the education loans 
we have historically structured and facilitated the securitization of education loans for our clients through a series of special purpose trusts 
the principal uses of the securitization trusts we facilitated have been to generate sources of liquidity for our clients and union federal s assets sold into such trusts and make available more funds to students and colleges 
see application of critical accounting policies and estimates consolidation above for a discussion of our determination to not consolidate these securitization trusts as of june  and the impact new accounting standards had on our determination to consolidate certain of these trusts and deconsolidate ufsb spv effective july

we also use a non gaap financial metric  net operating cash usage when evaluating our cash and liquidity position  discussed in detail under non gaap measure net operating cash usage below 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we received million in tax refunds as a result of our ability to carryback taxable losses from either fiscal or fiscal for five years instead of two years due to the enactment of the whbaa 
in addition  our securitization trusts segment received million in distributions from teri 
these cash inflows were partially offset by our funding of million to participation accounts during fiscal as we began processing education loans based on our monogram platform 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal reflected the receipt of tax refunds of million and million of proceeds from the sale of union federal s education loans held for sale 
we anticipate continuing to receive administrative and other fees related to our daily management and information gathering and reporting services for parties related to securitization trusts 
we also expect to receive fees related to loan origination and portfolio management services to other clients  and fees related to monogram based loan programs 
starting january   we also began to receive fees related to the operations of tms 
we believe that these fees  as well as management of our expenses  coupled with our significant cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to fund our operations in the short term as we seek to expand our client base over the short and long term 
while we believe that we may be successful in completing 
table of contents negotiations with respect to the sale of our monogram platform to additional lenders  we are uncertain as to how much loan volume may be originated by current or any such additional lenders in the future 
cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to million in principal collections on education loans and a decrease of million in restricted cash  partially offset by the net million of cash used for our acquisition of the assets  liabilities and operations of tms and the payment of million of restricted funds due to clients 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to a net million of cash invested in short term investments 
cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal  primarily reflecting the principal paydowns on long term borrowings by securitization trusts of million 
in addition  deposit volumes decreased million  particularly in time and online money market accounts  as a result of a planned reduction in deposit liabilities at union federal as we better aligned deposit rates to the yields available on union federal s assets 
in connection with the completion of our review of strategic alternatives for union federal  we ceased our deposit reduction strategy during the third quarter of fiscal cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal reflected decreases in the volume of deposits and payments under capital leases and borrowings under the education loan warehouse facility 
the occ  as successor to the ots  regulates all capital distributions by union federal directly or indirectly to us  including dividend payments 
union federal is required to file a notice with the occ at least days before the proposed declaration of a dividend or approval of a proposed capital distribution by union federal s board of directors 
union federal must file an application to receive the approval of the occ for a proposed capital distribution when  among other circumstances  the total amount of all capital distributions including the proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years 
a notice or application to make a capital distribution by union federal may be disapproved or denied by the occ if it determines that  after making the capital distribution  union federal would fail to meet minimum required capital levels or if the capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns or is otherwise restricted by statute  regulation or agreement between union federal and the occ or a condition imposed by an occ agreement 
under the federal deposit insurance act  or fdia  an fdic insured depository institution such as union federal is prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdia 
sources and uses of liquidity we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements primarily through cash and cash equivalents and revenues from operations  and we expect to fund our long term liquidity requirements through revenues from operations and issuances of common stock  promissory notes or other securities 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we were to enter into a strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to further delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our operational activities  which could harm our business 
our liquidity and capital funding requirements may depend on a number of factors  including cash necessary to fund our operations  including the operations of union federal and tms  and capital expenditures  the extent to which our services and products  including monogram based loan programs  gain market share and remain competitive at pricing favorable to us  the amount and timing of receipt of revenues from our monogram based loan program  which is dependent on  among other things  the amount of loan volume our clients are able to generate

in order to preserve capital and maximize liquidity in challenging market conditions  we have taken certain broad measures to reduce the risk related to education loans and residual receivables on our balance sheet  to change our fee structure and to add new products and reduce our overhead expenses 
see executive summary business trends  uncertainties and outlook  above for an expanded description of actions taken by us since fiscal in response to the economic challenges facing us 
in addition  our board of directors has eliminated regular quarterly cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock for the foreseeable future 
fiscal and fiscal have generated positive operating cash flow 
our liquidity and capital resources are impacted by our consolidated obligations to fund the deposits of union federal  tuition payments of tms  and long term borrowings of the securitization trusts

education loan warehouse facility the education loan warehouse facility is an obligation of ufsb spv  a vie which was reflected in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal but deconsolidated effective july  upon our adoption of asu and asu the education loan warehouse facility represented borrowings from a third party conduit lender 
such borrowings were used to finance the purchase of education loans originated by union federal 
neither fmd nor union federal was a borrower or co borrower under the facility 
the facility has been structured to limit the conduit lender s recourse to the assets of ufsb spv  which consist almost exclusively of the financed education loans

failed auctions occurred and have persisted with respect to a consolidated securitization trust that issued auction rate notes 
when failed auctions occur  the notes bear interest at a spread over one month libor as specified in the applicable indenture  based on the ratings assigned to the notes by independent rating agencies 
deterioration in securitization trust performance has resulted in downgrades to the ratings assigned to these notes  and  as a result  these notes bear interest at the maximum allowable spread over one month libor 
interest only securities had a combined notional value of billion at june   and have varying maturity dates from august to october interest payments and principal paydowns on the debt are made from collections on the purchased loans  or from the release of trust cash reserves  on a monthly or quarterly basis  as indicated in the table above 
within any given securitization trust  there may exist multiple classes of notes  certificates or interest only securities 
typically  notes within a given class are sequentially ordered based upon their original scheduled maturities 
interest payments and principal paydowns are made each distribution period based on cash available to the trust

other liabilities notes due to teri 
we entered into two ten year fixed notes payable agreements with teri in june to fund the acquisition of teri s loan processing operations and loan database 
under the terms of the stipulation  the amounts outstanding under the notes  as well as other liabilities  have been fully released by teri 
we recorded a resulting gain of million in the second quarter of fiscal related to the outstanding principal balances and accrued interest of the notes as of october   which we included in other income in our statement of operations 
borrowings under lines of credit 
at june   through union federal we had million available for borrowing under an unused line of credit with the federal home loan bank of boston 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at june  or june  support of subsidiary bank union federal is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements would initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our liquidity 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  union federal must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of union federal s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications  however  are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
union federal s equity capital was million at june   down significantly from million at june   principally due to the payment in november of a cash dividend from union federal to fmd of million  which was approved by the ots 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require union federal to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total capital and tier capital to risk weighted assets each as defined in the regulations 
as of june  and june   union federal was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
in march  our board of directors adopted resolutions required by the ots undertaking to support the implementation by union federal of its business plan  so long as union federal is owned or controlled by fmd  and to notify the ots in advance of any distributions to our stockholders in excess of million per fiscal quarter and any incurrence or guarantee of debt in excess of million 
fmd is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve  as successor to the ots  as a savings and loan holding company  and union federal is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the occ  as successor to the ots

table of contents non gaap measure net operating cash usage in addition to providing financial measurements based on gaap  we present below an additional financial metric that we refer to as net operating cash usage and that was not prepared in accordance with gaap 
we define net operating cash usage to approximate cash requirements to fund our operations 
net operating cash usage is not directly comparable to our consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap 
legislative and regulatory guidance discourage the use of  and emphasis on  non gaap financial metrics and require companies to explain why a non gaap financial metric is relevant to management and investors 
management and our board of directors use this non gaap financial metric  in addition to gaap financial measures  as a basis for measuring and forecasting our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods 
this non gaap financial measure is also used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
we believe that the inclusion of this non gaap financial metric helps investors to gain a better understanding of our quarterly and annual results  including our non interest expenses and year end liquidity position  particularly in light of dislocations in the education loan industry and the capital markets that have affected us 
in addition  our presentation of this non gaap financial measure is consistent with how we expect that analysts may calculate their estimates of our financial results in their research reports and with how investors  analysts and financial news media may evaluate our financial results 
there are limitations associated with reliance on any non gaap financial measure because it is specific to our operations and financial performance  which makes comparisons with other companies financial results more challenging 
nevertheless  by providing both gaap and non gaap financial measures  we believe that investors are able to compare our gaap results to those of other companies  while also gaining a better understanding of our operating performance  consistent with management s evaluation 
net operating cash usage should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
net operating cash usage relates solely to our education financing segment  and excludes the effects of income taxes  acquisitions or divestitures  participation account funding and changes in other assets and other liabilities that are solely related to short term timing of cash payments or receipts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is separately managed between our education financing segment and our securitization trusts segment 
for a description of the activities that constitute our education financing segment and our securitization trusts segment  see note  nature of business  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
education financing in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk applies to all of our interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as service revenue receivables 
credit risk is primarily related to loans  cash equivalents and investments 
interest rate risk the interest rate characteristics of our interest bearing assets are driven by the nature  volume and duration of our interest bearing liabilities 
generally  our interest bearing liabilities are either variable rate instruments or are of a short duration and are subject to frequent re pricing for demand liabilities or at maturity in the case of time deposits 
less than of our fixed rate customer deposits at union federal have maturities in excess of months from june  approximately of the deposits have variable interest rates or fixed interest rates with maturities of six months or less from june  as a result of our decision in the third quarter of fiscal to retain ownership of union federal  we have begun lengthening the average maturities of our customer deposits  and have begun converting a portion of union federal s cash and cash equivalents into higher earning  longer maturity assets 
deposit pricing is subject to weekly examination by a committee of senior managers from union federal and fmd s finance and risk and compliance departments 
the committee considers competitors pricing  inflows and outflows of deposit balances and union federal s funding requirements to make pricing decisions in order to attain the desired volume of deposits in each given duration and product type 
the frequent re pricing of our liabilities drives our investment decisions 
approximately of our mortgage loans have variable interest rates at june  excess cash is primarily invested in money market funds  federal funds sold  time deposits with original maturities of less than one year and us federal agency mortgage backed securities 
the matching of the interest rate characteristics and duration of assets and liabilities mitigates interest rate risk with respect to net interest revenues 
we frequently monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated fair value of service revenue receivables and net interest income 
we believe that we have adequately addressed interest rate risks in our cash flow models 
credit risk we manage cash  cash equivalents and investment assets conservatively 
the primary objective of our investment policy is the preservation of capital 
therefore  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments available for sale are invested with the federal reserve  in deposits and money market funds at highly rated institutions or in us government agency mortgage backed securities 

table of contents union federal offers conventional conforming and non conforming fixed and variable rate first and second residential mortgage loans  as well as commercial real estate loans 
we base our loan underwriting criteria primarily on credit score  consumer credit file information and collateral characteristics 
since our acquisition of union federal in  all mortgage loans have been underwritten such that they are saleable to institutional investors 
union federal does not offer high loan to value second mortgages  option adjustable rate mortgages or sub prime mortgage products 
our assumptions regarding defaults and recoveries of securitized loans both on and off balance sheet affect the expected timing of cash payments to us in respect of additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residual cash flows and our estimates of their fair value 
see note  service revenue receivables and related income  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we believe that we have adequately addressed credit risks in our cash flow models 
securitization trusts as a result of our adoption of asu and asu  our consolidated balance sheet includes portfolios of education loans  restricted cash and guaranteed investment contracts and long term borrowings that subject our results of operations to market risk 
our results of operations include interest income associated with securitized assets  a provision for loan losses and interest expense associated with the debt issued by the securitization trusts to third parties 
many aspects of market risk are mitigated by the design of the trusts established in the applicable indentures 
market risk is largely borne by the holders of the debt or the third party owner of the residual interests of these trusts  and not by our stockholders  because we have no ownership interest in the majority of the trusts that we consolidate 
the net deficit of the consolidated trusts included in our accumulated deficit is a non cash adjustment that will reverse over the lives of these trusts or at such time as our variable interests in these trusts are fully satisfied or eliminated 
interest rate risk we do not have the ability to actively manage interest rate risk for our consolidated securitization trusts 
interest rate risk is somewhat mitigated by the design of the trusts at the time of securitization 
generally  the securitization trusts financed the purchase of education loans with long term borrowings that have the same underlying index type and index reset frequency as the purchased loans  or using an index that would behave similarly to that of the purchased loans 
all of the education loans included in our securitization trusts segment have variable rates based on the one month libor rate  as do the majority of long term borrowings 
the trusts remain subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the outstanding principal on performing education loans does not match the outstanding principal on outstanding debt  but such risk will ultimately be borne by the holders of the debt or the third party owners of the trusts 
credit risk following our adoption of asu and asu  our consolidated balance sheet includes the restricted cash and guaranteed investment contracts of the consolidated securitization trusts 
credit risk related to cash and investments is managed through the design of the trust 
cash may only be invested in allowable investments established in the applicable indentures  including us treasury obligations  or deposits  money market accounts or guaranteed investment contracts of highly rated institutions 
trust administration performed by our education financing segment includes monitoring the placement of cash and investments in allowable investments established in the applicable indenture 
with respect to the education loans included in our securitization trusts segment  default prevention and collections management is performed on the trusts behalf by our fmer subsidiary in accordance with the applicable trust administration and special servicing agreements 
our portfolio management services for the securitization trusts  for a fee  puts us in a position to have power over activities impacting the economic performance of the trusts  which in turn is a significant factor in our determination to consolidate these trusts 
we employ risk analytics to monitor and manage the performance of the portfolio over time 
as part of this service 
table of contents offering  we monitor portfolio performance metrics  manage the performance of third party vendors and interface with rating agencies 
our infrastructure provides us with data that enables comprehensive analytics  and we are able to customize collections strategies as needed to optimize loan performance
