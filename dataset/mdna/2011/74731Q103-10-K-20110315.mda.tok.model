item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a public equity investment management firm that utilizes a classic value investment approach across all of our investment strategies 
we currently manage assets in a variety of value oriented investment strategies across a wide range of market capitalizations in both us and us capital markets 
at december   our assets under management  or aum  was billion 
we manage separate accounts on behalf of institutions and high net worth individuals  and act as sub investment adviser for a variety of sec registered mutual funds and offshore funds 
we function as the holding company through which the business of our operating company  pzena investment management  llc the operating company  is conducted 
concurrently with the consummation of our initial public offering and reorganization on october   we became the sole managing member of the operating company 
as such  we now control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and other investors collective membership interest in our operating company  we reflect their ownership as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we have consolidated the financial results of the operating company with our own and reflected the membership interest in it that we do not own as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements  and we recognize income generated from our economic interest in the operating company net income 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of our operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of our business 
non gaap net income our results for the years ended december    and included adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement and the associated liability to selling and converting shareholders 
we believe that these accounting adjustments add a measure of non operational complexity which partially obscures the underlying performance of the business 
in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations  we also review certain non gaap measures of earnings  which exclude these items 
excluding these adjustments  non gaap diluted net income and non gaap diluted net income per share were million and  respectively  for the year ended december   million and  respectively  for the year ended december   and million and  respectively  for the year ended december  gaap and non gaap net income for diluted earnings per share generally assumes all operating company membership units are converted into company stock at the beginning of the reporting period  and the resulting change to our net income associated with our increased interest in the operating company is taxed at our effective tax rate 
the company effective tax rate  exclusive of adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement and the associated liability to selling and converting shareholders  was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  as noted in the section income tax provision benefit  below 
we use these non gaap measures to assess the strength of the underlying operations of the business 
we believe that these adjustments  and the non gaap measures derived from them  provide information to better analyze our operations between periods  and over time 
investors should consider these non gaap measures in addition to  and not as a substitute for  financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

our advisory fee income is recognized over the period in which investment management services are provided 
following the preferred method identified in the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  income from incentive fees is recorded at the conclusion of the contractual performance period  when all contingencies are resolved 
our advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of our aum 
our aum increases or decreases with the net inflows or outflows of funds into our various investment strategies and with the investment performance thereof 
in order to increase our aum and expand our business  we must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients  and provide attractive returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our aum  and our ability to continue to attract clients  will depend on a variety of factors including  among other things our ability to educate our target clients about our classic value investment strategies and provide them with exceptional client service  the relative investment performance of our investment strategies  as compared to competing products and market indices  
table of contents competitive conditions in the investment management and broader financial services sectors  general economic conditions  investor sentiment and confidence  and our decision to close strategies when we deem it to be in the best interests of our clients 
for our institutional accounts  we are paid fees according to a schedule  which varies by investment strategy 
the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
pursuant to our sub investment advisory agreements with our retail clients  we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of these funds pay us fixed rate management fees 
due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts  the average advisory fees we earn on them  as a percentage of aum  are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our institutional accounts 
certain of our clients pay us fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreed upon benchmarks  which results in a slightly lower base fee  but allows us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreed upon benchmark 
the majority of advisory fees we earn on institutional accounts is based on the value of our aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis  either in arrears or advance 
advisory fees on certain of our institutional accounts  and with respect to most of our retail accounts  are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value 
advisory fees are also generally adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio  where the cash flow represents greater than of the value of the portfolio 
while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate  the method used to calculate the fee according to the fee rate schedule may differ as described above 
our advisory fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following changes in aum due to appreciation or depreciation of our investment portfolios  and the levels of the contribution and withdrawal of assets by new and existing clients  distribution of aum among our investment strategies  which have differing fee schedules  distribution of aum between institutional accounts and retail accounts  for which we generally earn lower overall advisory fees  and the level of our performance with respect to accounts on which we are paid incentive fees 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expenses  as well as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  awards of equity to our employees and members of our operating company  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  and expenses  such as rent  professional service fees and data related costs  incurred  as necessary  to run our business 
compensation and benefits expense our largest expense is compensation and benefits  which includes the salaries  bonuses  equity based compensation  and related benefits and payroll costs attributable to our members and employees 

table of contents compensation and benefits packages are benchmarked against relevant industry and geographic peer groups in order to attract and retain qualified personnel 
pursuant to the pzena investment management  llc amended and restated equity incentive plan the pim llc equity incentive plan  we have issued restricted units and options to purchase units in the operating company 
we use a fair value method in recording the compensation expense associated with the granting of these restricted units  and options to purchase units  to new and existing members under the pim llc equity incentive plan 
under this method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
the fair value of the units is determined by reference to the market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant  since these units are exchangeable for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the fair value of the options to purchase units is determined by using an appropriate option pricing model on the grant date 
pursuant to the pzena investment management  llc amended and restated bonus plan the bonus plan  eligible employees whose cash compensation is in excess of certain thresholds have a portion of that excess mandatorily deferred 
these deferred amounts may be invested  at the employee discretion  in certain third party mutual funds  restricted phantom units of our operating company  or money market funds 
amounts deferred in any calendar year reduce that year cash compensation expense and vest ratably over a four year period beginning on january st of the next year 
for the years ended december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  in such compensation was deferred 
for the year ended december   no such compensation was deferred 
at december  and  the liability associated with deferred compensation investment accounts was approximately million and million  respectively  which is recorded in the deferred compensation liability on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in compensation and benefits expense associated with the amortization of all prior deferred compensation awards 
should additional amounts be deferred in future years  we would expect the non cash portion of our compensation expense to increase as the previously and subsequently deferred amounts are amortized through income 
as of december   we had approximately million in total unrecorded compensation expense related to unvested operating company phantom units issued pursuant to our bonus plan  operating company unit and option grants issued under the pim llc equity incentive plan  and stock and option grants issued under our pzena investment management  inc equity incentive plan the equity incentive plan 
we expect that the amortization of these amounts will be approximately million in  million in  million in  and million in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include office rent and other expenses  professional and outside services fees  depreciation  and the costs associated with operating and maintaining our research  trading  and portfolio accounting systems 
our occupancy related costs and professional services expenses  in particular  generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the overall size and scale of our business operations 
we incur additional expenses associated with being a public company for  among other things  director and officer insurance  director fees  sec reporting and compliance including sarbanes oxley sox compliance  professional fees  transfer agent fees  and other similar expenses 
these additional expenses have and will continue to reduce our net income 

table of contents other income expense other income expense is derived primarily from investment income or loss arising from our consolidated investment partnerships  our investments in various private investment vehicles that we employ to incubate new strategies  income or loss arising from our investments in third party mutual funds  interest expense on our outstanding debt prior to its repayment  mark to market movements on our swap agreement prior to its termination  and interest income generated on our cash balances 
other income expense is also affected by changes in our estimates of the liability due to our selling and converting shareholders associated with payments owed to them under the tax receivable agreement which was executed in connection with our reorganization and offering on october  as discussed further below  under tax receivable agreement  this liability represents of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state  and local income tax that we realize as a result of the amortization of the increases in tax basis generated from our acquisitions of our operating company units from our selling and converting shareholders 
amounts waived by our selling and converting shareholders reduce this liability 
we expect the interest and investment components of other income expense  in the aggregate  to fluctuate based on market conditions and the performance of our consolidated investment partnerships and other investments 
non controlling interests our operating company has historically consolidated the results of operations of the private investment partnerships over which we exercise a controlling influence 
after our reorganization  we became the sole managing member of our operating company and now control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and outside investors interest in our operating company  we have reflected their membership interests as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  subsequent to october   our income is generated by our economic interest in our operating company net income 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of the operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of the business 
income tax provision benefit while our operating company has historically not been subject to us federal and certain state income taxes  it has been subject to new york city unincorporated business tax 
as a result of our reorganization  we are now subject to taxes applicable to c corporations 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company units in conjunction with the offering and subsequent exchanges was million and million  respectively 
operating results assets under management and flows as of december   our approximately billion of aum was invested in a variety of value oriented investment strategies  representing distinct capitalization segments of us and us equity markets 
the performance and aum of our five largest investment strategies as of december  are further described below 
we follow the same investment process for each of these strategies 
our investment strategies are distinguished by the market capitalization ranges from which we select securities for their portfolios  which we refer to as each strategy investment universe  as well as the regions in which we invest 
while our investment process includes ongoing review of companies in the investment universes described below  our actual investments may include companies outside of the relevant market capitalization range at the time of our investment 
in addition  the number of holdings typically found in the portfolios of each of our investment strategies may vary  as described below 

table of contents our earnings and cash flows are heavily dependent upon prevailing financial market conditions 
significant increases or decreases in the various securities markets  particularly the equities markets  can have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the change in aum in our institutional accounts and our retail accounts for the years ended december    and is described below 
inflows are composed solely of the investment of new or additional assets by new or existing clients 
outflows consist solely of redemptions of assets by existing clients 
year ended december  assets under management in billions institutional accounts beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows market appreciation depreciation end of period assets retail accounts beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows market appreciation depreciation end of period assets total beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows market appreciation depreciation end of period assets the following table describes the allocation of our aum among our investment strategies  as of december    and aum at december  in billions us value strategies global value strategies eafe value strategies total 
table of contents beginning in the second half of  and particularly during the second half of through early  the performance of our investment strategies was negatively impacted by significant volatility in the equity markets 
beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through  the performance of our investment strategies improved alongside the significant improvement in the equity markets 
as a result of the continued improvements in the performance of our investment strategies and the equity markets  our aum increased by billion  or  from billion at december   to billion at december   and increased by billion  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  investment performance during was influenced by our overweight exposure to the financial services sector in particular  which underperformed the market  resulting in a decrease in our aum of billion  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  at december   we managed billion in institutional accounts and billion in retail accounts  for a total of billion in assets 
for the year ended december   we experienced total gross inflows of billion  which were offset by total gross outflows of billion 
assets in institutional accounts increased by billion  or  from billion at december   due to billion in market appreciation and billion in gross inflows  offset by billion in gross outflows 
assets in retail accounts decreased by billion  or  from billion at december   as a result of billion in gross outflows  partially offset by billion in gross inflows and billion in market appreciation 
at december   the company managed billion in institutional accounts and billion in retail accounts  for a total of billion in assets 
for the year ended december   we experienced gross inflows of billion  which were offset by gross outflows of billion 
assets in institutional accounts increased by billion  or  from billion at december   due to billion in market appreciation and billion in gross inflows  offset by billion in gross outflows 
assets in retail accounts increased by billion  or  from billion at december   as a result of billion in market appreciation and billion in gross inflows  offset by billion in gross outflows 
the institutional net inflows were mainly attributable to the establishment of several new client relationships in our non us diversified value strategies 
the net outflows in our retail accounts were driven by our investment strategies medium term underperformance relative to their respective benchmarks  which caused some of our sub advised mutual fund clients to reduce their exposure to us  or withdraw their funds 
at december   we managed billion in institutional accounts and billion in retail accounts  for a total of billion in assets 
for the year ended december   we experienced total gross outflows of billion  which were offset by total gross inflows of billion 
assets in institutional accounts decreased by billion  or  from billion at december   due to billion in market depreciation and billion in gross outflows  offset by billion in gross inflows 
assets in retail accounts decreased by billion  or  from billion at december   as a result of billion in gross outflows and billion in market depreciation  partially offset by billion in gross inflows 
at december   institutional accounts represented of our total aum  compared to at december   and at december  at december   our eafe value and global value investment strategies accounted for of our aum  compared to at december   and at december  our revenues are correlated with the levels of our weighted average aum 
our weighted average aum fluctuates based on changes in the market value of accounts advised and managed by us  and on fund flows 
since we are long term fundamental investors  we believe that our investment strategies yield the most benefits  and are best evaluated  over a long term timeframe 
we believe that our investment strategies are generally evaluated by our clients and our potential future clients based on 
table of contents their relative performance since inception  and the previous one year  three year  and five year periods 
there has typically been a correlation between our strategies investment performance and the size and direction of asset flows over the long term 
to the extent that our returns for these periods outperform client benchmarks  we would generally anticipate increased asset flows over the long term 
correspondingly  negative returns relative to client benchmarks could cause existing clients to reduce their exposure to our products  and hinder new client acquisition 
given our higher weighted average aum in compared to  our revenues for the year ended december  increased from our revenues for the year ended december  an increase in weighted average aum and in revenues typically results in higher operating income and net income 
given our lower weighted average aum in compared to  our revenues for the year ended december  decreased from our revenues for the year ended december  a decrease in weighted average aum and in revenues typically results in lower operating income and net income  and pressure on our operating margins 
we would expect similar pressure on our operating margins in the future if average aum and revenues were to decline 
for the year ended december   our operating expenses increased from their comparable and periods  due to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses  resulting from increases in employee headcount and discretionary bonus accruals 
the following table indicates the annualized returns  gross and net which represents annualized returns prior to and after payment of advisory fees  respectively  of our five largest investment strategies from their inception to december   and in the five year  three year  and one year periods ended december   relative to the performance of i the market index which is most commonly used by our clients to compare the performance of the relevant investment strategy  and ii the s p index  which is provided for the limited purpose of providing a comparison to the broader equity market

our weighted average fees were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was due in part to the full year effect of the large institutional inflows in our eafe diversified value and global diversified value strategies that were launched in late we typically offer reduced fee rates to initial clients in our new product offerings

for the year ended december   net income attributable to non controlling interests was income of million  and consisted of million associated with our employees and outside investors approximately interest in the income of the operating company  offset by the million effect of the absorption  by our consolidated subsidiaries  of their share of the losses of our consolidated investment partnerships 
the change in net income attributable to non controlling interests reflects primarily the decline in our weighted average aum  which had a corresponding negative impact on operating company revenues and income  as well as a decline in our employees and outside investors ownership interests in the operating company 
this decline was partially offset by the positive return on the investments in our consolidated investment partnerships in liquidity and capital resources historically  the working capital needs of our business have primarily been met through the cash generated by our operations 
distributions to members of our operating company and loan amortization payments have been our largest use of cash from financing activities 
investing activities have historically been investments in our own investment strategies and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents was million 
advisory fees receivable was million 
we also had approximately million in marketable equity securities and approximately million in investments set aside to satisfy our obligations under our deferred compensation program 
we expect to fund the liquidity needs of our business in the next twelve months  and over the long term  primarily through cash generated from operations 
as an investment management firm  our business has been materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
our liquidity is highly dependent on the revenue and income from our operations  which is directly related to our levels of aum 
for the year ended december   
table of contents our weighted average aum and revenues increased by and  respectively  compared to our weighted average aum and revenues for the year ended december  these increases contributed to a increase in our cash provided by operating activities during the same periods 
in determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including  among other things  cash  working capital  investments  long term liabilities  lease commitments  debt obligations  and operating company distributions 
compensation is our largest expense 
to the extent we deem necessary and appropriate to run our business  recognizing the need to retain our key personnel  we have the ability to change the absolute levels of our compensation packages  as well as change the mix of their cash and non cash components 
historically  the company has not tied its levels of compensation directly to revenue  as many wall street firms do 
correspondingly  there is not a linear relationship between the company compensation and the revenues it generates 
this generally has the effect of increasing operating margins in periods of increased revenues  but can reduce operating margins when revenue declines 
we continuously evaluate our staffing requirements and compensation levels with reference to our own liquidity position and external peer benchmarking data 
the result of this review directly influences management recommendations to our board of directors with respect to such staffing and compensation levels 
we anticipate that tax allocations to the members of our operating company  which consisted of of our employees  certain unaffiliated persons  two former employees  and us  will continue to be a material financing activity 
cash distributions to operating company members for partnership tax allocations would increase should the taxable income of the operating company increase 
as further discussed below  our operating company was a party to a credit agreement the credit agreement associated with our bank term loan 
among other things  certain amendments to the credit agreement precluded us from paying dividends to shareholders  as did one of the provisions of the senior subordinated notes  further discussed below 
during the year ended december   we terminated our credit agreement 
on december   the restriction on the payment of dividends contained in the notes was waived  and during the year ended december   we repaid the full principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
we do not anticipate that the termination of the revolving credit facility  originally obtained in conjunction with the credit agreement  will have a material effect on our liquidity position  as no amounts were drawn against it over the course of its existence 
we currently do not have any material need for cash in excess of that derived from our operations 
although we are comfortable with our current capital structure  in the current economic environment  it is uncertain whether additional or alternative sources of debt or equity financing would be available on acceptable terms  if required 
we do not anticipate meaningful outlays for internal investment or capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we believe that the repayment of our bank term loan and senior subordinated notes  and ability to vary cash compensation levels  have provided us with an appropriate degree of flexibility in providing for our liquidity needs 
dividend policy we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders 
when  and if  our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the dividends declared 
our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations  particularly with respect to liquidity 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common shareholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended 
table of contents dividends 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 
on an annual basis  our board of directors has targeted a cash dividend payout ratio of approximately to of our non gaap net income  subject to growth initiatives and other funding needs 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to board discretion and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law 
see item a risk factors our ability to pay dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law 
credit agreement and senior subordinated notes during the year ended december   we repaid the remaining principal amount outstanding under our bank term loan and terminated the related credit agreement 
concurrent with the termination of this bank term loan and the credit agreement  the security interest previously granted in our accounts receivable was released 
during the year ended december   we repaid the remaining principal amount outstanding of the senior subordinated notes 
tax receivable agreement our purchase of membership units of our operating company concurrent with our initial public offering  and the subsequent and future exchanges by holders of class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the exchange rights provided for in the operating company operating agreement  has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in  increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company at the time of our acquisition and these subsequent and future exchanges  which will increase the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us 
these increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions have reduced  and are expected to continue to reduce  the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the current members of our operating company  the one member of our operating company immediately prior to our initial public offering who sold all of its membership units to us in connection with our initial public offering  and any future holders of class b units  that requires us to pay them of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by us  or a change in control  as described in the tax receivable agreement as a result of the increases in tax basis described above and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement  including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement 
in october  the selling shareholders agreed to a two year waiver of any payments that we were required to make to them for the and tax years pursuant to the tax receivable agreement 
cash flows operating activities provided million and million in cash flows for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities was driven primarily by a increase in weighted average aum  from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december   which had a corresponding positive impact on total revenues and profits 
operating activities provided million and million in cash flows for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year decline in cash flows from operating 
table of contents activities was driven primarily by a decrease in weighted average aum from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december   which had a corresponding negative impact on total revenues and profits 
investing activities consist primarily of activity with related parties  as well as capital expenditures 
investing activities used less than million for each of the years ended december    and financing activities consist primarily of borrowing arrangements and contributions from  and distributions to  non controlling interests 
financing activities used million for the year ended december   and used million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an million reduction in principal repayment associated with our debt obligations  and a million increase in contributions from non controlling interests  offset by an increase of million in distributions to non controlling interests  and an increase of million in dividend payments 
financing activities used million for the year ended december   and used million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a million reduction in distributions to non controlling interests associated with reduced operating company income  partially offset by a million increase in net principal repayments associated with our borrowing agreements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease for office space total off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition 
management believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 

table of contents consolidation our policy is to consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
we also consolidate non variable interest entities which we control as the general partner or managing member 
we assess our consolidation practices regularly  as circumstances dictate 
all significant inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated 
investments in private investment partnerships in which we have a minority interest and exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method 
such investments  if any  are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as investments in affiliates and are recorded at the amount of capital reported by the respective private investment partnerships 
such capital accounts reflect the contributions paid to  distributions received from  and the equity earnings of  the private investment partnerships 
the earnings of these private investment partnerships are included in equity in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are a c corporation under the internal revenue code  and thus liable for federal  state and local taxes on the income derived from our economic interest in our operating company 
the operating company is a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes 
our operating company has not made a provision for federal or state income taxes because it is the responsibility of each of the operating company members including us to separately report their proportionate share of the operating company taxable income or loss 
similarly  the income of our consolidated investment partnerships is not subject to income taxes  as such income is allocated to each partnership individual partners 
the operating company has made a provision for new york city unincorporated business tax ubt 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
determining the valuation allowance requires significant management judgments and assumptions 
in determining the valuation allowance  we use historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
each quarter  we re evaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future taxable income 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the million valuation allowance  recorded against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company membership units  is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes  or variances in future projected operating performance  could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
if we were not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  evaluating our tax positions and establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to earnings would result 

table of contents recent accounting developments variable interest entities vies in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued a new standard that requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
under the standard  an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
an enterprise that holds a substantive interest and a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie and is required to consolidate the vie 
the standard also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and additional disclosures about an enterprise involvement in vies  and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in november  the fasb issued a proposed standard update  which defers the consolidation criteria requirements of this new standard for assets managers interests in entities that apply the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies  or that have the attributes of investment companies 
in february  the fasb issued further guidance which provided a limited scope deferral for a reporting entity interest in an entity that meets all of the following conditions a the entity has all the attributes of an investment company as defined under aicpa audit and accounting guide  investment companies  or does not have all the attributes of an investment company but is an entity for which it is acceptable based on industry practice to apply measurement principles that are consistent with the aicpa audit and accounting guide  investment companies  b the reporting entity does not have explicit or implicit obligations to fund any losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity  and c the entity is not a securitization entity  asset backed financing entity or an entity that was formerly considered a qualifying special purpose entity 
the reporting entity is required to perform a consolidation analysis for entities that qualify for the deferral in accordance with previously issued guidance on vies 
we have evaluated the deferral guidelines and determined that the standard is applicable for our investment in our operating company  but that we meet the criteria for deferral provided in this standard for our vies 
we adopted the updated guidance on january   and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are monitoring future guidance for updates on the treatment of our interests in our vies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment adviser for the institutional separate accounts we manage and the retail clients for which we act as sub investment adviser 
as noted in item a  risk factors  we experienced declines in aum from the quarter ended september   through the quarter ended march   largely due to the volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets 
during those periods  we experienced declines in revenue and profitability  and there can be no assurance that there will not be declines in our aum  revenue and profitability should volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets occur again in the future 
an economic downturn  and volatility in the global financial markets  could also significantly affect the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments 
our revenue for the three years ended december  was generally derived from advisory fees  which are typically based on the market value of our aum  which can be affected by adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange and equity prices 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline  due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of the holdings of our consolidated subsidiaries  which consist primarily of marketable securities and investments in mutual funds 
at december   the fair value of these assets was million and million  respectively 
assuming a increase or decrease  the fair value would increase or decrease by million and million  respectively  at december  interest rate risk since the company does not have any debt that bears interest at a variable rate  it does not have any direct exposure to interest rate risk at december
