overview we provide business solutions for human resources which include a comprehensive suite of on demand software applications and complementary services  including outsourcing services and consulting  to help global organizations recruit high performing individuals and increase employee productivity and retention 
we employ a large force of organizational and industrial psychologists and statisticians who study the science of human behavior and its impact on business outcomes 
this research is the foundation of our suite of software applications and supporting services that enable our customers to improve business results through human resources 
based on our years of experience assisting customers in addressing their human resource requirements we believe our software applications and services form solutions that enable our customers to improve the effectiveness of their talent acquisition programs  increase employee productivity and retention  measure key hr metrics and make their talent acquisition and employee performance management programs more efficient 
since  we have focused on providing talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions on a subscription basis and currently generate a significant portion of our revenue from these subscriptions 
our customers typically purchase multi year subscriptions with an average length of approximately two years 
for the years ended december  and  subscription revenue represented approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
we generate the remainder of our revenue from discrete professional services that are not provided as part of an integrated solution on a subscription basis 
we sell our solutions to large and medium sized organizations through our direct sales force 
as of december   we had a global customer base of approximately  companies  including approximately companies on the fortune list published in may our customer base includes companies that we billed for services during the year ended december  and does not necessarily indicate an ongoing relationship with each such customer 
our top customers contributed approximately million  or  of our total revenue for the year ended december  our customers typically purchase multi year subscriptions which provide us with a recurring revenue stream 
our customers renewed and of their contracts for each of the years ended december  and  respectively which represented of the aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and performance management solution contracts up for renewal for each of those years 
this renewal rate provides us with a strong base of recurring revenue 
we believe that our strong customer relationships provide us with a meaningful opportunity to cross sell additional solutions to our existing customers and to achieve greater penetration within an organization 
as the business environment improves we expect renewal rates to improve to our historical renewal rate in excess of in may  we launched a major upgrade to our product line 
our x platform includes applications such as kenexa x recruit  kenexa x brassring  kenexa x onboard and our first to market kenexa x mobile solution 
future modules to the x platform include kenexa x perform  kenexa x assess  kenexa x analytics and kenexa x survey 
we believe that kenexa x enables customers to improve productivity  increase cost savings  ensure compliance with corporate and legal mandates  and raise employee engagement 
as of december  the national unemployment rate dropped from the prior year to and with the drop we have witnessed a slow but steady improvement in business conditions 
the unemployment rate is slowly improving  and recent industry reports suggest that the unemployment rate will continue to improve over the balance of this year and into background we commenced operations in as a provider of recruiting services to a wide variety of industries 
in  we offered our first automated talent acquisition system and by we had expanded our business to provide employee research  employee performance management technology and consulting services 
in late  responding to a growing demand from our customers  we began to provide comprehensive human capital management services integrated with on demand software 
between and  we acquired businesses that collectively enabled us to offer comprehensive human capital management hcm services integrated with on demand technology 
over the past eleven years  we have pursued a strategy designed to focus our business on talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions and reduce our strategic focus on discrete professional services that generated less predictable revenue streams and lower margins 
to that end in  we exited our temporary staffing business  in and  we acquired four businesses which enhanced our screening and behavioral assessment solutions and skills testing technologies  since  we reduced our strategic focus on position specific recruiting services  in  we discontinued our oracle implementation business and sold our pharmaceutical training division  in  we expanded our presence in north america and enhanced our customer base through our acquisition of scottworks solutions  inc  in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and customer base through our acquisitions of webhire  inc  knowledge workers inc  gantz wiley research consulting group inc  psychometric services limited 
and brassring inc  in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and customer base through our acquisitions of strategic outsourcing corporation and hrc human resources consulting gmbh  in  we expanded our global footprint in the talent acquisition space through our acquisition of quorum international holdings limited  in  we entered into an ownership interest transfer agreement with shanghai runjie management consulting company to gain presence in china s human capital management market  and in  we expanded our global footprint and added to our product offerings through our acquisitions of chpd and salary 
com 
as a result of our shift in strategic focus in  we have focused on providing talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions on a subscription basis and currently generate a significant portion of our revenue from these subscriptions 
we generate the remainder of our revenue from discrete professional services that are not provided as part of an integrated solution on a subscription basis 
in  revenue derived from subscriptions for these solutions comprised approximately of our total revenue 
since  subscription revenue has represented approximately of our total revenue 
for the years ended december and  subscription revenue represented approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
this shift to subscription based services has been driven by our customer s adoption of the on demand model for software delivery and need for solutions that improve employee recruiting and retention 
we expect non gaap subscription revenue will be within a target range of to of our total revenues in from our inception through  our operations were funded primarily through internally generated cash flows and our line of credit  as well as private placements of our securities to institutional investors 
on june   we completed our initial public offering and listed our common stock for trading on the nasdaq stock market 
recent events in july  in accordance with our ubs ag agreement  we exercised our right to sell our auction rate securities back to ubs and liquidated our auction rate security portfolio in its entirety 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of chpd which operates as a leadership development and management training company based in london  england for a purchase price of approximately million in cash 
the total cost of the acquisition including estimated legal  accounting  and other professional fees was approximately million 
we deposited million into escrow to cover any claims for indemnification 
we acquired all assets and liabilities of chpd using our existing cash and expect the acquisition of chpd will enhance our existing research and content portfolio as well as provide our customers with the ability to more efficiently implement the results of their employee engagement surveys 
on august   we entered into a secured credit agreement with pnc bank  na  in connection with our acquisition of salary 
com 
the secured credit agreement included a maximum amount available under the credit facility of million  including a sublimit of up to million for letters of credit and swing loans 
borrowings under the new credit facility were secured by substantially all of the company s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries 
prior to termination of the credit agreement as discussed below  the company borrowed million under the credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of salary 
com 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of salary 
com  which provides on demand compensation software that helps businesses and individuals manage pay and performance  for a purchase price of approximately million in cash 
the total cost of the acquisition including estimated legal  accounting  and other professional fees of million  was approximately million 
we used cash and borrowings against the credit facility to fund the acquisition 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand salary 
com s adoption in large organizations and on a global basis because its compensation analysis software is highly synergistic with our current suite of talent acquisition and retention solutions 
on  october   we terminated and paid all outstanding amounts under our secured credit agreement  dated august   and entered into an amended credit agreement with pnc bank 
the maximum amount available under the amended credit agreement is million  comprised of a million revolving facility  including a sublimit of up to million for letters of credit and a sublimit of up to million for swing loans the revolving facility  and a million term facility the term facility 
we may request to increase the maximum amount available under the revolving facility to million 
the amended credit agreement will terminate  and all borrowings will become due and payable  on october  we and each of our us subsidiaries are guarantors of the obligations under the amended credit agreement 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets including a pledge of the capital stock of their subsidiaries but limited to only of the voting stock of first tier foreign subsidiaries 
as of december  we borrowed million under the amended credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of salary 
com and to enhance working capital 
sources of revenue we derive revenue primarily from two sources subscription revenue for our solutions  which is comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from customers purchasing additional support that is not included in the basic subscription fee  and fees for discrete professional services 
our customers primarily purchase renewable subscriptions for our solutions 
the typical subscription term is one to three years  with some terms extending up to five years 
the majority of our subscription agreements are not cancelable for convenience  but our customers have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to provide the agreed upon services or otherwise breach the agreement 
a customer does not generally have a right to a refund of any advance payments if the contract is cancelled 
our customers renewed and of their contracts for each of the years ended december  and  respectively which represented of the aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and performance management solution contracts up for renewal for each of those years 
as the business environment improves we expect renewal rates to improve to our historical renewal rate in excess of 
consistent with our historical practices  revenue derived from subscription fees is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable prior to the receipt of payment and in deferred revenue to the extent revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
as of december   deferred revenue increased by million or to million from million at december  the increase in deferred revenue is a result of the increase in sales of our multiple elements or bundled arrangements and our acquisition of salary 
com 
we generally price our solutions based on the number of software applications and services included and the number of customer employees 
accordingly  subscription fees are generally greater for larger organizations and for those that subscribe for a broader array of software applications and services 
we derive other revenue from the sale of discrete professional services and translation services  as well as from out of pocket expenses 
the majority of our other revenue is derived from discrete professional services  which primarily consist of consulting and training services and success fees 
this revenue is recognized differently depending on the type of service provided  as described in greater detail below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was derived from sales in the united states 
foreign revenue that we generated from customers in the united kingdom  germany and china was approximately  and  respectively 
revenue for other countries amounted to an aggregate of 
other than the countries listed  no other country represented more than of our total revenue for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the percentage of revenue derived from sales in the united states decreased over the prior year due our emphasis on global expansion 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees and independent contractors who provide consulting or other professional services to our customers 
additionally  our application hosting costs  amortization of third party license royalty costs  technical support personnel costs  overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses are also recorded as cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends  changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses and fluctuations in our customer base 
because cost as a percentage of revenue is higher for professional services than for software products  an increase in the services component of our solutions or an increase in discrete professional services as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
as our revenues increase  we expect our cost of revenue to increase proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and influenced by the mix of services and software 
to the extent new customers are added  we expect that the cost of services  as a percentage of revenue  will be greater than those services associated with existing customers 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing  including salaries  commissions  and other variable compensation  travel expenses and costs associated with trade shows  advertising and other marketing efforts and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time the related revenue is recognized  and we recognize revenue from our subscription agreements ratably over the terms of the agreements 
consistent with our past practice  we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new customers and expand relationships with existing customers at levels we deem appropriate given our current economic conditions 
we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase from current levels  mainly due to increased staff expense and continued emphasis on our rebranding effort 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the short term as we incur additional professional fees in connection with our patent infringement matter 
however  in the longer term  based upon the current state of the economy  we believe that general and administrative expenses will remain the same or slightly increase in dollar amount and remain relatively constant or slightly decrease as a percentage of total revenue in research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs  including salaries  and employee benefits  for software engineers  quality assurance engineers  product managers  technical sales engineers and management information systems personnel and third party consultants 
our research and development efforts have been devoted primarily to the preliminary stages of project development and maintenance and training costs of our existing products 
as we continue to execute on our strategies  including rolling out our x platform and continuing to develop feature enhancements  we believe that research and development expenses will remain flat or increase slightly in dollar amount in key performance indicators the following tables summarize the key performance indicators that we consider to be material in managing our business  in thousands other than percentages for the year ended december  non gaap income from operations total non gaap revenue non gaap subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue net non gaap cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  total deferred revenue the following is a discussion of significant terms used in the tables above 
non gaap financial measures 
we believe that non gaap measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
we use these non gaap measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses  for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation  and for budget and planning purposes 
these measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to our board of directors 
we believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing financial measures with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
we do not consider such non gaap measures in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with gaap 
the principal limitation of such non gaap financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by gaap to be recorded 
in addition  they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non gaap financial measures 
in order to compensate for these limitations  we present our non gaap financial measures in connection with our gaap results 
we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
non gaap cash from operations 
non gaap cash from operations consists of gaap cash flows from operations adjusted for non recurring payments of liabilities associated with our acquisitions and payments of acquisition related fees totaled million 
these exclusions are made to gaap cash from operations to facilitate a consistent and more meaningful comparison to the prior year since their effect was not included in our results 
for the year ended december  unaudited unaudited unaudited cash from operations non recurring payments associated with acquisition acquisition related fees non gaap cash from operations non gaap revenue 
non gaap revenue consists of gaap revenue  adjusted to reverse the effect of the write down of deferred revenue associated with purchase accounting for the salary 
com acquisition 
this effect during the three months ended december  was million and is added back to non gaap revenue because we believe its inclusion provides a more accurate depiction of total revenue arising from the salary 
com acquisition 
non gaap subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
non gaap subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue can be derived from our consolidated statements of operations adjusted for the effect of the write down of the deferred revenue associated with purchase accounting for the salary 
com acquisition as described above 
we expect that the percentage of non gaap subscription revenue will be within a target range of to of our total revenues in for the year ended december  unaudited unaudited unaudited revenue subscription revenue deferred revenue associated with acquisition non gaap subscription revenue other non gaap revenue non gaap income from operations 
non gaap income from operations is derived from income loss from operations adjusted for noncash or nonrecurring expenses 
we believe that measuring our operations  using non gaap income from operations provides more useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and ongoing results 
we believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investor to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
for the year ended december  unaudited unaudited unaudited loss from operations share based compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles acquisition related fees deferred revenue associated with acquisition professional fees associated with variable interest entity severance expense expenses related to restructuring charges and related legal fees goodwill impairment charge noncontrolling interests non gaap income from operations the company s non gaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following share based compensation 
share based compensation consists of expenses for stock options and stock awards that we began recording in accordance with asc during the first quarter of share based compensation was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
share based compensation expenses are excluded in our non gaap financial measures because they are difficult to forecast 
this is due in part to the magnitude of the charges  which depends upon the volume and timing of stock option grants that are unpredictable and can vary dramatically from period to period  and external factors such as interest rates and the trading price and volatility of our common stock 
amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 
in accordance with gaap  operating expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets which are amortized over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our non gaap financial measures because we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry  which have their own unique acquisition histories 
acquisition related fees 
in accordance with asc  business combinations  acquisition related fees including advisory  legal  accounting and other professional fees are reported as expense in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received 
acquisition related fees of million  for the year ended december  include legal  travel  and other fees not expected to recur from the acquisitions of salary 
com and chpd 
acquisition related fees are excluded in the non gaap financial measures because we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry  which have their own unique acquisition histories 
deferred revenue associated with acquisition 
deferred revenue consists of the effect of the write down of the deferred revenue associated with purchase accounting for the salary 
com acquisition 
this effect during the year ended december  was million and is added back since we believe its inclusion provides a more accurate depiction of total revenue arising from the salary 
com acquisition 
professional fees associated with variable interest entity 
we incurred professional fees in connection with our chinese expansion in the amount of million during the first quarter of we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry  which have their own unique acquisition histories 
severance expenses 
we incurred charges in the amount of million in relation to additional severance expenses in the first quarter of these charges were excluded from non gaap income to facilitate a more meaningful comparison to the prior year s results 
expenses related to restructuring charges and related legal fees 
we incurred charges in the amount of million in relation to restructuring in the fourth quarter of such charges consisted of severance and outplacement benefit costs of million and certain legal fees of million in relation to the termination of approximately employees 
goodwill impairment charge 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of of million and million in the fourth quarter of of as a result of a substantial decrease in our stock price  reflecting the impact of the unprecedented turmoil in world economies and the resultant impact on our operations 
noncontrolling interest 
noncontrolling interest of million includes income from operations due to our variable interest entity partner and is excluded from the calculation of non gaap net income from operations because it is unrelated to our ownership in the venture 
deferred revenue 
we generate revenue primarily from multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions and our compensation module 
we recognize revenue from these subscription agreements ratably over the hosting period  which is typically one to three years 
we generally invoice our customers in annual  quarterly or monthly installments in advance 
deferred revenue  which is included in our consolidated balance sheets  is the amount of invoiced subscriptions in excess of the amount recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue represents  in part  the amount that we will record as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
as the subscription component of our revenue has grown and our customer willingness to pay us in advance for their subscriptions has increased  the amount of deferred revenue on our balance sheet has grown 
it is possible that this trend may vary as business conditions change 
the following table reconciles beginning and ending deferred revenue for each of the periods shown for the year ended december  in thousands deferred revenue at the beginning of the year total invoiced subscriptions during the year deferred revenue from acquisition subscription revenue recognized during the year total deferred revenue at end of year critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable and accrued expenses 
we base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two sources subscription revenues for solutions  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and other fees for professional services  translation services and reimbursed out of pocket expenses 
because we provide our solutions as a service  we follow the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb asc  revenue recognition and fasb asc multiple element arrangements 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we enter into arrangements with customers which may include consulting services  software licenses and data 
for sales arrangements that contain multiple deliverables revenue is allocated among the deliverables using the selling price hierarchy established in asu to determine the selling price of each deliverable 
the selling price hierarchy allows for the use of estimated selling price esp to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe 
we determined our esp of fair value for our application services based on the following we utilize a pricing model for our products which considers market factors such as customer demand for its products  and the geographic regions where the products are sold 
in addition  the model considers entity specific factors such as volume based pricing  discounts for bundled products and total contract commitment 
management approval of the model ensures that all of our selling prices are consistent and within an acceptable range for use with the relative selling price method 
while the pricing model currently in use captures all critical variables  unforeseen changes due to external market forces may result in revising some of the inputs 
these modifications may result in the consideration allocation differing from the one presently in use 
absent a significant change in the pricing inputs or the way in which the industry structures its deals  future changes in the pricing model are not expected to materially affect our allocation of arrangement consideration 
to qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if the arrangement does not meet all criteria above  the entire amount of the transactions is deferred until all elements are delivered 
we determine the selling price in multiple element arrangements using vsoe or tpe if available 
vsoe is determined based on the price charged for the same deliverable when sold separately and tpe is established based on the price charged by our competitors or third parties for the same deliverable 
if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe does not exist  we use our esp 
this change in policy increased our revenues by approximately million for the year ending december  subscription fees and support revenues 
subscription fees and support revenues are recognized ratably over the lives of the contracts 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accordance with fasb asc  principal agent considerations  we record reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue and not netted with the applicable costs 
these items primarily include travel  meals and certain telecommunication costs 
reimbursed expenses for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to pay us 
the provision is based on our historical experience and for specific customers that  in our opinion  are likely to default on our receivables from them 
in order to identify these customers  we perform ongoing reviews of all customers that have breached their payment terms  as well as those that have filed for bankruptcy or for whom information has become available indicating a significant risk of non recoverability 
we rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue over days past due and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable associated with new customers and evaluate these customers over time 
to the extent that our future collections differ from our assumptions based on historical experience  the amount of our bad debt and allowance recorded may be different 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our health insurance costs  including claims filed and claims incurred but not reported subject to certain stop loss provisions 
we estimate our liability based upon management s judgment and historical experience 
we also rely on the advice of consulting administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
our self insurance accruals which are reported on a gross basis totaled approximately million for each of the periods ended december  and we continuously review the adequacy of our insurance coverage 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of insurance expense if actual experience differs significantly from management estimates 
capitalized software development costs in accordance with fasb asc  software  and fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  costs incurred in the preliminary stages of a development project are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  will be capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
maintenance and training cost are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
there were no impairments to internal software in any of the periods covered in this report 
goodwill and other identified intangible asset impairment since  we have recorded goodwill in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which requires us to annually review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment 
if goodwill becomes impaired  some or all of the goodwill would be written off as a charge to operations 
this comparison is performed annually or more frequently if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
during the quarter ended december  we reevaluated our goodwill  due to adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from october  our annual testing date  and a downward revision in our earnings guidance for the quarter and year ended december  these factors signaled a triggering event  which required us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill may have been impaired as of december  the first step of this analysis requires the estimation of our fair value  as an entity  and is calculated based on the observable market capitalization with a range of estimated control premiums as well as discounted future estimated cash flows 
this step yielded an estimated fair value for us which was less than our carrying value including goodwill at december  the next step entails performing an analysis to determine whether the carrying amount of goodwill on our balance sheet exceeds our implied fair value 
the implied fair value of our goodwill  for this step was determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination 
our estimated fair value was allocated to our assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if we had been acquired in a business combination with our estimated fair value representing the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process performed on the test date was only for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill with neither the write up or write down of any assets or liabilities  nor recording any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets as part of this process as of december  based on the analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was million  resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
during the quarter ended march  we reevaluated our goodwill due to continued adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from december  through march  and a downward revision in internal projections 
these factors signaled a triggering event  which required us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill may have been impaired as of march  the allocation process performed on the test date was only for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill with no assets or liabilities written up or down  nor any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets recorded as part of this process 
based on the analysis  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded to write off the remaining balance of our goodwill for the quarter ended march  the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on the company s cash balances accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign countries 
we record an income tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of operating results reportable to each taxing jurisdiction in compliance with enacted tax legislation 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
our determination of the level of valuation allowance at december  is based on an estimated forecast of future taxable income which includes many judgments and assumptions primarily related to revenue  margins  operating expenses  tax planning strategies and tax attributes in multiple taxing jurisdictions 
accordingly  it is at least reasonably possible that future changes in one or more of these assumptions may lead to a change in judgment regarding the level of valuation allowance required in future periods 
accounting for share based compensation share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest multiplied by the fair value 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our share based awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award and is based on a weighted average of peer companies  comparable indices and our stock volatility 
an increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is currently based upon an average of the contractual life and the vesting period of the options 
with the passage of time actual behavioral patterns surrounding the expected term will replace the current methodology 
changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase in our expense 
the estimated forfeiture rate is the rate at which awards are expected to expire before they become fully vested and exercisable 
an increase in the forfeiture rate would result in a decrease to our expense 
in certain instances where market based  performance share awards are granted  we use the monte carlo valuation model to calculate the fair value 
this approach utilizes a two stage process  which first simulates potential outcomes for our shares using the monte carlo simulation 
the first stage of the monte carlo simulation requires a variety of assumptions about both the statistical properties of our shares as well as potential reactions to such share price movements by our management

goodwill impairment during the quarter ended march  we reevaluated our goodwill due to continued adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from december  through march  and a downward revision in internal projections 
these factors signaled a triggering event  which required us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill may have been impaired as of march  we reviewed our goodwill by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values of the enterprise 
fair value is based on our estimate of the future discounted cash flows to be generated by the enterprise and our market capitalization 
such cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  historical trends  as well as demand and competition 
comparable company multiples are based upon public companies in sectors relevant to our business based on our knowledge of the industry

cost of revenue was highest as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended december  as our overall revenue fluctuates  we expect our cost of revenue to change proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and slightly influenced by the mix of services and software

goodwill impairment during the three months ended march  we reviewed the carrying values of goodwill by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values of the enterprise 
the fair value is based on management s estimate of the future discounted cash flows to be generated by the enterprise and our market capitalization 
such cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  historical trends  as well as demand and competition 
comparable company multiples are based upon public companies in sectors relevant to our business based on our knowledge of the industry 
changes in the underlying business could affect these estimates  which in turn could affect our assessment of the recoverability of goodwill 
due to adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from october   and a downward revision in earnings guidance  we reevaluated our goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the analysis  a goodwill impairment charge of million for the three months ended march  was recorded 
the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances

recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asc  consolidation overall  and asc  business combinations 
changes for business combination transactions pursuant to asc include  among others  expensing of acquisition related transaction costs as incurred  the recognition of contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair value and capitalization of in process research and development assets acquired at their acquisition date fair value 
changes in accounting for noncontrolling minority interests pursuant to asc include  among others  the classification of noncontrolling interest as a component of consolidated shareholders equity and the elimination of minority interest accounting in results of operations 
asc is required to be adopted and was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of asc and asc impacted our accounting related to the consolidation of its variable interest entity in and impacted the accounting for our current acquisition 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for variable interest entities 
this guidance was codified under asu in december and includes the elimination of the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities  a new approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie  which requires that the primary beneficiary have both i the power to control the most significant activities of the vie and ii either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie  and the requirement to continually reassess who should consolidate a vie 
the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods that begin after november  and applies to all existing and new vies 
we adopted asu on january  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in january  we adopted the accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  which eliminates the use of the residual method for allocating consideration  as well as the criteria that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value of undelivered elements in order to separate the elements in a multiple element arrangement 
by removing the criterion requiring the use of objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables  the recognition of revenue will more closely align with certain revenue arrangements 
the standard also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
asu no 
is effective for revenue arrangements entered or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
see revenue recognition above for further details  including financial impact 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  asu requires performance of an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and to calculate the amount of impairment 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  we will adopt asu in the first quarter of the impact of adopting asu will not be known until we perform our evaluations of goodwill impairment 
in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
asu specifies that  for material business combinations when comparative financial statements are presented  revenue and earnings of the combined entity should be disclosed as though the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
asu also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period after december  we will adopt this standard for acquisitions in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk in  approximately of our total revenue was comprised of sales to customers in the united states 
a key component of our business strategy is to expand our international sales efforts  which will expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a increase in the value of the us dollar during  relative to each currency in which our non us generated sales are denominated would have resulted in reduced annual revenues of approximately for the year ended december  the financial position and operating results of our foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency 
local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date  and the local currency revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange to the us dollar during the period 
the related translation adjustments to shareholders equity were a decrease of million and million during and  respectively  and are included in other comprehensive income loss 
the foreign currency translation adjustment is not adjusted for income taxes because it relates to an indefinite investment in a non us subsidiary 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
our cash equivalents  which consist solely of money market funds  are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we believe that a change in interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our interest income for the year ended december  we also have a million loan with pnc bank na  of which million is subject to an interest rate swap  which we used to partially fund our acquisition of salary 
com in the third quarter of we performed a sensitivity analysis on the outstanding variable portion of this loan as of december  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in annual interest expense that would result from an immediate increase decrease in interest rates 
change in interest rate corresponding expense reduction in interest expense
