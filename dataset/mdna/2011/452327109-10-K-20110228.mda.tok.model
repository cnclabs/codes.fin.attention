item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements  and see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
business overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer  and marketer of life science tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function 
using our proprietary technologies  we provide a comprehensive line of genetic analysis solutions  with products and services that serve a broad range of highly interconnected markets  including sequencing  genotyping  gene expression  and molecular diagnostics 
our customers include 
table of contents leading genomic research centers  academic institutions  government laboratories  and clinical research organizations  as well as pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrigenomics  and consumer genomics companies 
our broad portfolio of systems  consumables  and analysis tools are designed to simplify genetic analysis 
this portfolio addresses the range of genomic complexity  price points  and throughputs  enabling researchers to select the best solution for their scientific challenge 
in  through our acquisition of solexa  inc  we acquired our proprietary sequencing by synthesis sbs technology that is at the heart of our leading edge sequencing instruments 
these systems can be used to efficiently perform a range of nucleic acid dna  rna analyses on large numbers of samples 
for more focused studies  our array based solutions provide ideal tools to perform genome wide association studies gwas involving single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping and copy number variation cnv analyses  as well as gene expression profiling and other dna  rna  and protein studies 
to further enhance our genetic analysis workflows  in january we acquired epicentre technologies corporation  a leading provider of nucleic acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes for sequencing and microarray applications 
in  through our acquisition of helixis  inc  we expanded our portfolio to include real time polymerase chain reaction pcr  one of the most widely used technologies in life sciences 
our new eco real time pcr system provides researchers with an affordable  full featured system to perform targeted validation studies 
we are organized in two business segments  the life sciences business unit and the diagnostics business unit 
during  our diagnostics business unit had limited business activity and  accordingly  operating results are reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment 
at each reporting period end  we reassess our reportable operating segments  particularly as we continue to develop our molecular diagnostics business 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item of this report 
business trends and outlook our financial results have been  and will continue to be  impacted by several significant trends  which are described below 
while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results  the other transactions  events  and trends discussed in risk factors in item a of this report may also materially impact our business operations and financial results 
next generation sequencing growth in the sequencing market and enhancements in our product portfolio continue to drive both sequencing instrument and consumable sales 
in q  we began customer shipments of the hiseq  our newest high throughput next generation sequencing instrument 
the hiseq was developed over a three year period and is designed to provide ultra high sequencing throughput that will significantly lower the cost of sequencing 
as a result of the launch  a substantial number of our customers who previously purchased the genome analyzer sequencing system ordered the hiseq to replace their existing sequencer with this new system 
as a result of strong demand  both from customers who desired to trade in their existing genome analyzers and new customers who ordered the hiseq  our manufacturing capacity was constrained throughout all of during the year we significantly increased our manufacturing capacity for the hiseq to meet growing demand 
we now believe that we have increased our capacity to the point where we can begin reducing our backlog and fulfilling new orders in a more timely manner 
additionally  in the first half of  we expect to further enhance the performance of the hiseq we believe that these enhancements will enable customers to sequence whole human genomes for less than  in consumable costs 
as we continue to make improvements that reduce the cost of sequencing we believe that more customers will use the hiseq  which generates more revenue per instrument time than the genome analyzer 
we believe that this will increase our consumable pull through  which is a measure of the annual consumable revenue generated from each instrument in the installed base 

table of contents in q  we expect to begin volume customer shipments of our recently announced miseq  a low cost personal sequencing system that we believe will provide individual researchers a platform with rapid turnaround time  high accuracy  and streamlined workflow 
we believe the launch of the miseq will expand our presence in the lower throughput sequencing market 
microarrays as a complement to advances in sequencing technology  we believe microarrays offer a cheaper  faster  and more accurate technology for use when genetic content is known 
the information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible 
as such  microarrays provide repeatable  standardized assays for certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome 
during  microarray product sales increased as compared to  led by the launch of the omni  a four sample beadchip enabling interrogation of approximately million markers per sample  growth in sales of focused content arrays primarily from use for genetic screening in applied markets such as agriculture and fine mapping for follow up to gwas projects  and the launch of the hiscansq  our instrument that integrates next generation sequencing with genotyping and gene expression arrays 
as additional new rare variant content becomes available from the genomes project  an international research effort launched in to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic variation  we plan to launch a microarray that will feature approximately five million markers per sample 
we expect to begin customer shipments of this product in mid however  the launch of this product will depend on the timing of the release of new content from the genomes project 
we believe new product introductions as new content becomes available will continue to drive growth in the sales of our microarray products 
american recovery and reinvestment act of the recovery act the recovery act was enacted in february to provide stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the economic downturn 
as part of the recovery act legislation  over billion in funding was provided to the national institutes of health nih to support the advancement of scientific research 
while it is not possible to precisely quantify the net impact of orders resulting from the recovery act due to the uncertainty surrounding orders that would have been received in absence of stimulus  we believe approximately million in orders during were directly related to recovery act grants 
we believe recovery act funds will continue to be spent by our customers through gross margin our gross profit as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased during as compared to due to the effects of discounts provided to customers on the sales of hiseq s associated with promotional programs  including the genome analyzer trade in program  and lower margins on our newer products  such as the hiseq over the course of  we expect our gross margin to improve as the genome analyzer trade in program is completed and sales of consumables  which generally carry a higher gross margin than instruments  increase as a percentage of total revenue 
we also expect improved manufacturing efficiency for the hiseq to improve gross margin in operating expense we expect to incur additional operating costs to support the expected growth in our business 
we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remain competitive and expand into additional markets 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our product base 
selling  general and administrative expenses are also 
table of contents expected to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in staff and infrastructure to support top line growth and global expansion 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is dependent on the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes in item a of this form k 
for and beyond  we anticipate increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions  which may adversely impact the provision for income taxes 
due to the expected utilization of the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards and us federal research and development tax credit carryforwards  we anticipate significant income tax payments in and beyond 
results of operations to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended january   january  and december  stated as a percentage of total revenue

consumable revenue increased million  or  to million for compared to million for microarray consumable revenue  which constituted more than half of our total consumable revenue  increased million primarily attributable to growth in sales of our infinium beadchips  which constituted a majority of our microarray consumable sales 
sales volume of our infinium beadchip products increased on a per sample basis during compared to the average selling price per sample  however  declined due to a change in product mix primarily attributable to growth in sales of our focused content arrays and a number of large sample volume purchase orders that incurred higher discounts 
revenue from sequencing consumables increased million due to growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems 
revenue from the sale of instruments increased million  or  to million for compared to million for sequencing instrument revenue increased million 
we experienced increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our sequencing systems during compared to unit growth was due to increased demand for next generation sequencing systems 
the increase in average selling prices was primarily attributable to the launch of the hiseq in q microarray instrument revenue increased million primarily attributable to strong demand for our hiscansq instrument launched in the launch of this system resulted in increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our microarray instruments during compared to the increase in service and other revenue  which includes extended warranty contracts and genotyping and sequencing services  was primarily attributable to an increase in extended warranty contracts for our growing installed base of sequencing systems 
gross margin the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the effect of discounts provided to customers on the sales of hiseq associated with promotional programs  including the genome analyzer trade in program  and lower margins on our newer products  such as the hiseq see revenue recognition in note organization and summary of significant accounting policies in part ii  item  of this form k for additional information on the genome analyzer trade in program 
the impact of the promotional programs was partially offset by improved margins on sequencing consumables primarily attributable to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with chemistry improvements 

table of contents operating expense change change in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative acquisition related gain expense  net total operating expense the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel expenses  including salaries  non cash share based compensation  and benefits  and an increase in other non personnel expenses of million comprised mostly of lab and production supplies expenses 
these increases were primarily attributable to investments in new product development and commercialization along with projects to sustain and optimize our existing product portfolio 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel expenses  including salaries  non cash share based compensation  and benefits  associated with the growth of our business  and an increase in outside service expenses of million comprised mostly of legal and marketing expenses

provision for income taxes change change in thousands income before income taxes provision for income taxes effective tax rate 
table of contents the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the gain recorded on the change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of helixis  inc that is excluded from taxable income and a decrease in nondeductible acquired ipr d recognized for financial reporting purposes in as compared to comparison of and our fiscal year is or weeks ending the sunday closest to december  with quarters of or weeks ending the sunday closest to march  june  september  and december the year ended january  was weeks and the year ended december  was weeks 
revenue change change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue total revenue total gross profit total gross margin revenue product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 
consumable revenue increased million  or  to million for compared to million for microarray consumable revenue  which constituted more than half of our consumable revenue  declined million primarily attributable to lower sales of whole genome genotyping arrays partially offset by growth in focused content arrays 
the decline was driven by customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the genome project  order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act  and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers 
sales volume for our infinium beadchip product lines  which constituted a majority of our microarray consumable sales  was relatively flat on a sample basis during compared to the average selling price per sample  however  declined due to a change in product mix attributable to growth in the sales of our focused content arrays coupled with lower sales of whole genome genotyping arrays 
revenue from sequencing consumables increased million driven by growth in the installed base of our genome analyzer systems and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale 
the increase was partially offset by a loss of sales related to a quality issue affecting our paired end cluster kits that arose in september when some of our larger sequencing customers began experiencing higher than average error rates on the second read of their paired end analysis 
during the fourth quarter  we began shipping reformulated paired end cluster kits at full capacity and cleared the related shipping backlog 
revenue from the sale of instruments increased million  or  to million for compared to million for primarily due to a million increase in sales of our sequencing systems 
during as compared to units sold and average selling prices increased for our genome analyzer systems  which constituted a majority of sequencing instrument revenue 
the increase in units sold was driven by increased demand for next generation sequencing systems 
the increase in average selling prices was attributable to the product transition from the genome analyzer i to the genome analyzer ii in the second quarter of and technological improvements leading to the launch of the genome analyzer iix in the second quarter of the increase in sequencing instrument revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in the sales of our microarray systems  which declined primarily due to customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the genomes project  order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act  and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers 

table of contents gross margin the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower costs for our sequencing consumables and instrumentation  a million impairment charge recorded in for which there was no similar charge recognized in  and a million decrease in amortization expense 
the gross margin on sequencing consumables increased primarily due to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes of sequencing consumables and the benefit of decreased costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits launched at the end of the third quarter of the gross margin on sequencing instruments increased primarily due to production efficiencies and reduced material costs coupled with higher average selling prices 
operating expense change change in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative acquisition related gain expense  net total operating expense the increase in research and development was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel related expenses  including salaries  non cash share based compensation and benefits  a million increase to non personnel related expenses  and an increase in outside services of million attributable to consulting fees 
these increases were primarily related to the growth in our efforts to optimize and commercialize our sequencing and beadarray technologies 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of million in personnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business  including salaries  non cash share based compensation  and benefits 
during acquisition related gain expense  net  includes ipr d charges of million related to milestone payments made to the former shareholders of a company we acquired in during acquisition related gain expense  net  includes ipr d charges of million as a result of the same acquisition

table of contents provision for income taxes change change in thousands income before income taxes provision for income taxes effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in nondeductible acquired ipr d recognized for financial reporting purposes in compared to additionally  the percentage of consolidated income before income taxes earned in foreign jurisdictions  which primarily have lower statutory tax rates than the us statutory tax rate  increased from in to in liquidity and capital resources cash flow summary in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities in consists of net income of million plus net non cash adjustments of million and a million decrease in net operating assets 
the primary non cash expenses added back to net income included share based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization expenses related to property and equipment and intangible assets of million  and the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes totaling million 
the main drivers in the change in net operating assets included increases in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
these increases were primarily related to the growth of our business 
cash provided by operating activities in consists of net income of million plus net non cash adjustments of million and an million increase in net operating assets 
the primary non cash expenses added back to net income included share based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment  intangibles and the debt discount on our convertible notes totaling million 
investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled million in during the year we purchased and sold available for sale securities totaling million and million  respectively  paid net cash of million for acquisitions  sold trading securities totaling million  used million for capital expenditures primarily associated with the purchase of manufacturing equipment and infrastructure for additional production capacity and rental and loaner instruments  and made strategic investments totaling million 

table of contents cash used in investing activities totaled million in we purchased and sold available for sale securities totaling million and million  respectively 
we incurred million in capital expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our facilities and infrastructure at our san diego  hayward and uk locations 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million in we received million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants and under our employee stock purchase plan 
we also received million in incremental tax benefit related to stock options exercised 
these increases were partially offset by common stock repurchases of million 
cash used in financing activities totaled million in during the year we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million  which was partially offset by million in proceeds received from issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and under our employee stock purchase plan 
we also received million in incremental tax benefit related to stock options exercised 
liquidity we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity 
our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating  investing  and financing needs 
historically  we have issued debt and equity securities to finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs 
at january   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
our short term investments include marketable securities consisting of debt securities in government sponsored entities  corporate debt securities  and us treasury notes 
on february   we issued million in principal of convertible senior notes that mature february  we pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on february and august of each year 
the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock under certain circumstances as described in note convertible senior notes in part ii  item of this form k 
as of january   the principal amount of the notes was million due to the conversion of million of the notes during the first quarter of during the period from january  to february   certain noteholders notified us of their election to convert an aggregate of million principal amount of the notes 
see note subsequent events in part ii  item  of this form k for additional information on these conversions 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to potential strategic acquisitions and investments  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the united states and abroad  the repurchase of our outstanding common stock  the continued advancement of research and development efforts  the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  and the expansion needs of our facilities  including costs of leasing additional facilities 
we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our new product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next months  barring unforeseen circumstances 
operating needs 
table of contents include the planned costs to operate our business  including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop our technologies and create innovative products in our markets  scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
during the fiscal year ended january   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of the rules of the sec 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of january   aggregated by type amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years debt obligations operating leases amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan total the table excludes million of uncertain tax benefits 
we have not included this amount in the table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities  if any 
see note income taxes in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
the table also excludes million in contingent consideration related to acquisitions 
we have not included this amount in the table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding whether the milestones required for these payments will be achieved 
see note acquisitions in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of our contingent consideration 
debt obligations include the principal amount of our convertible senior notes and interest payments totaling per annum 
although these notes mature in  we classify the principal amount of the notes as current in our consolidated balance sheet due to the convertibility feature 
in addition  during the period from january  to february   certain noteholders notified us of their election to convert an aggregate of million principal amount of the notes in exchange for the repayment of the principal amount and a certain number of shares of the company s common stock 
see note convertible senior notes and note subsequent events in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes and the conversion notices in the subsequent period 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  market and other conditions  and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  the estimation process is  by its nature  uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control 
if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate  our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected 
in addition  if our assumptions change  we may need to revise our estimates  or take other corrective actions  either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments 
in addition  had we used estimates different from any of these  our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented 
members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates  and our disclosure regarding them  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note organization and significant accounting policies in part ii  item of this form k 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis 
service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services  extended warranty sales  and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required  revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met 
all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 
in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable  we evaluate whether refund rights exist 
if there are refund rights or payment terms based on future performance  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 
we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products or services 
these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame  approximately three to six months  of the contract execution date 
revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 

table of contents for transactions entered into in and  consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists  we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
for transactions entered into prior to  consideration was generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement 
the fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the product  if the item was regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
in those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items  the residual method was used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
when we were unable to establish stand alone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established  revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed  or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
in order to establish vsoe of selling price  we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range 
vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range 
if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined  then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price 
due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry  we have rarely established selling price using third party evidence 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions 
if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient  we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
in the first quarter of  we offered an incentive with the launch of the hiseq that enabled existing genome analyzer customers to trade in their genome analyzer and receive a discount on the purchase of a hiseq the incentive was limited to customers who had purchased a genome analyzer as of the date of the announcement and was the first significant trade in program we have offered 
we will account for hiseq discounts related to the genome analyzer trade in program in the period in which the hiseq revenue is recognized 
investments we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 

table of contents in using this fair value hierarchy  management may be required to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk  specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value 
these assumptions are judgmental in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding  review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers and we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete  or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions  and the release of new products that will supersede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycles  quality issues  historical experience  and usage forecasts 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
we routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  to the extent losses are reasonably estimable 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  past history  scientific and other evidence  and the specifics and status of each matter 
we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes  which may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual 
predicting the outcome of claims and litigation  and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting  we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition 
the fair values assigned  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants  are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets  net of liabilities assumed  as goodwill 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones 
prior to fiscal year  the company recognized contingent consideration as an additional element of the cost of the acquisition  generally goodwill  when the contingency was resolved beyond a reasonable doubt and the additional consideration was issued or became issuable 
due to changes in the accounting standards regarding business combinations  for all acquisitions consummated on or after december   a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing 
table of contents variable factors such as anticipated future cash flows  risk free adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk 
any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense  net  a component of operating expenses  in the consolidated statements of income 
this method requires significant management judgment  including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates 
future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 
management uses a discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives  we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows  the time value of money  and other factors that a willing market participant would consider 
significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
we had a total of million in net property and equipment and million in net intangible assets on our balance sheet at january  assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
for example  if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units  we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets 
impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
share based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of fair value of share based awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price  expected life of an award  expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate 
we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock 
the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards  adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably 
table of contents expected to recur  and other relevant factors 
implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchange traded call options on our common stock 
the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience  exercise activity  and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards 
we determined expected dividend yield to be given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards 
we amortize the fair value of share based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the us and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates  and estimates of the company s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
factors reviewed include the cumulative pre tax book income for the past three years  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  our history of earnings and reliable forecasting  projections of pre tax book income over the foreseeable future  and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
based on the available evidence as of january   we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million and million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets  respectively 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company s return filing positions 
due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability 
these differences  as well as any interest and penalties  will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
warranties we generally provide a one year warranty on instruments 
additionally  we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiry date  which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date 
we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance 
we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve  and adjust  if necessary  the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred 
if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do 
table of contents not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
in addition  if a basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in  our interest income would change by approximately million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn  based on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of january  changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes 
as of january   we had million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding 
the notes are convertible into cash  and if applicable  shares of our common stock under certain circumstances  including trading price conditions related to our common stock 
if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of per share  we expect that noteholders will elect to convert the notes 
upon conversion  we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value 
the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate 
the net carrying value of the notes has an implicit interest rate of 
if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes  we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 
an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of million aggregate principal amount of the notes would result in a loss of approximately million 
market price sensitive instruments in order to reduce potential equity dilution  in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our convertible notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions  entitling us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
in addition  we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a net share basis  for up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the anti dilutive effect of the note hedge transactions  if any  could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants  which occur during  assuming the warrants are exercised 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the entity s us dollar functional currency 
these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash 
our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro  yen  british pound sterling  australian dollar  and singapore dollar 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income 
we recorded a net currency exchange gain on business transactions  net of hedging transactions  of million for each of the years ended january  and january   which are included in other expense income  net  in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents we use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures  and they generally have terms of one month or less 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income  as they have not been designated for hedge accounting 
these contracts  which settle monthly  effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled  so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities 
at january   we had million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk
