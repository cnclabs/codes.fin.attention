overview nautilus is committed to providing innovative  quality solutions to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle 
our principal business activities include designing  developing  sourcing and marketing high quality cardiovascular and strength fitness products and related accessories for consumer home use  primarily in the united states and canada 
our products are sold under some of the most recognized brand names in the fitness industry  including nautilus  bowflex  schwinn and universal 
we market our products through two distinct distribution channels  direct and retail  which we consider to be separate business segments 
our direct business offers products to consumers through television advertising  catalogs and the internet 
our retail business offers our products through a network of independent retail companies with stores and websites located in the united states and canada 
economic and market conditions have been  and continue to be  disruptive and volatile 
these conditions include reduced business and consumer confidence  disruptions in the residential housing market  materially reduced consumer credit availability for our customers and increased unemployment  all of which have contributed to reductions in consumer spending  particularly on discretionary products such as our home fitness equipment 
our net sales in were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to net sales of million in the decline in net sales primarily reflected a continuing decline in our sales of rod based home gyms  which was due in part to reduced availability of consumer credit financing during the first three quarters of offsetting the decline in home gym revenues were increased sales of our bowflex treadclimber products  due in part to new creative advertising and greater customer awareness of the treadclimber product line 
driven primarily by strong treadclimber sales  revenues of all cardio products increased by in  compared to  while sales of all strength products decreased by year over year 
based on sales trends observed in the fourth quarter of  we expect that increased sales of treadclimber products should more than offset anticipated declines in home gym sales by the second half of in september  we completed our transition to a new consumer credit program with a new primary third party financing provider  ge money bank ge  and since then we have experienced incremental growth in customer financing approval rates 
in addition  we added two secondary third party consumer credit financing providers during  both of which offer credit to certain qualified consumers whose credit applications have been declined by ge 
customer credit approvals by our primary and secondary third party financing providers increased throughout the fourth quarter of and averaged approximately of the applications we processed during the period  compared to in the fourth quarter of management expects customer credit approval rates in will remain at the levels experienced late in the fourth quarter of or improve modestly as we continue to optimize our consumer financing programs 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
we have not made any material changes in the methodologies we use in our critical accounting estimates during the past three fiscal years and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use 
however  if our assumptions or estimates change in future periods  the impact on our financial position and operating results could be material 
sales discounts and allowances 
table of contents product sales and shipping revenues are reported net of promotional discounts and return allowances 
we estimate the revenue impact of retail sales incentive programs based on the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if the amount of our retail sales incentives can be reasonably estimated  we record the impact of such incentives at the later of the time we notify our customer of the sales incentive  or the time of the sale 
if actual amounts differ from our estimates  revenue is adjusted 
our calculation of amounts owed for sales discounts and allowances contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions in interim periods and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including estimated future customer inventory purchases and returns 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired 
finite lived intangible assets  including patents and patent rights  are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in we recognized million in impairment charges related to intangible assets used in our continuing operations 
impairment charges of million related to intangible assets of discontinued operations were recognized in no intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values 
our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows  market conditions  relative levels of risk  the cost of capital  terminal values  royalty rates  and the allocation of revenues  expenses and assets and liabilities to business segments 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets and  thereby  could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
product warranty obligations our products carry limited defined warranties for defects in materials or workmanship 
our product warranties generally obligate us to pay for the cost of replacement parts  cost of shipping the parts to our customers and  in certain instances  service labor costs 
at the time of sale  we record a liability for the estimated costs of fulfilling future warranty claims 
the estimated warranty costs are recorded as a component of cost of sales  based on historical warranty claim experience and available product quality data 
if necessary  we adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
our estimates of warranty expenses are based on significant judgment  and the frequency and cost of warranty claims are subject to variation 
warranty expenses are affected by the performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to the customer  product failure rates and variances in expected repair costs 
uncertainties exist with respect to outstanding warranty obligations of our commercial business  now a discontinued operation  as units sold to customers approach end of life and settlements are reached with certain customers in connection with our exit from the commercial business 
as of december   our warranty liability included million for future warranty costs of our former commercial business  which represents management estimate of the probable amount 
however  in light of the aforementioned uncertainties  management believes it is reasonably possible that actual warranty costs of our former commercial business could exceed this amount by as much as million  which if realized would decrease operating results of discontinued operations in future periods 
litigation and loss contingencies from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and any losses or gains we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we record expenses for litigation and loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of internal and external counsel  outcomes from similar litigation  status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates accordingly 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance 
table of contents we account for income taxes based on the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be included  as income or expense  in the applicable tax return 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the enactment 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of million 
if our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant judgments are required in determining tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
such judgments require us to interpret existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our circumstances 
in particular  our valuation allowance contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
if our financial results or other relevant facts change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position  significant judgment would be applied in determining the effect of the change on our valuation allowance 
risks and uncertainties our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period 
our revenues will fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry  customer buying patterns  product innovation  the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products  our ability to procure products to meet customer demand  the level of spending on  and effectiveness of  our media and advertising programs  and our ability to attract new customers and renew existing sales relationships 
in addition  our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors  including  among other things  the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the united states and canada 
our profit margins may vary in response to the aforementioned factors and our ability to manage product costs 
profit margins may also be affected by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products  product warranty costs  higher or lower fuel prices  and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing related services 
our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the relative success of strategies we employ to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization 
historically  our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and air television advertisements  facility costs and operating costs of our information and communications systems 
in addition  our operating expenses have been impacted by asset impairment charges  restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses 
as a result of the above and other factors  our period to period operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
you should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies  both within and outside our industry 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and  consequently  we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability

the bowflex treadclimber is sold exclusively through our direct channel 
strength products include home gyms  selectorized dumbbells  kettlebell weights  weight benches and accessories 

table of contents direct business net sales of our direct business were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to direct net sales of million in the decline in net sales in our direct business reflected a decline in sales of strength products  primarily rod based home gyms  which was due in part to reduced availability of consumer credit financing during the first three quarters of partially offsetting the decline in home gym sales was an increase in sales of our bowflex treadclimber products  due in part to new creative advertising and greater customer awareness of the treadclimber product line 
revenues of all cardio products in our direct channel decreased by only in  compared to based on sales trends observed in the fourth quarter of  we expect that increased sales of treadclimber products should more than offset anticipated declines in home gym sales in our direct channel by the second half of in september  we completed our transition to a new consumer credit program with a new primary third party financing provider  ge money bank ge  and since then we have experienced incremental growth in customer financing approval rates

customer credit approvals by our primary and secondary third party financing providers increased throughout the fourth quarter of and averaged approximately of the applications we processed during the period  compared to in the fourth quarter of management expects customer credit approval rates in will remain at the levels experienced late in the fourth quarter of or improve modestly as we continue to optimize our consumer financing programs 
gross profit margin of our direct business was in  a decrease of percentage points compared to the comparative decrease in direct gross profit margin was attributable primarily to lower sales of higher margin home gyms and deep discounts offered on one specific home gym model 
retail business net sales of our retail business were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to retail net sales of million in the increase in retail net sales was attributable primarily to customer demand for our newly redesigned fitness bikes and elliptical products and sales to new customers 
sales of all cardio products in our retail channel increased by in  compared to  which was partially offset by a decrease in retail channel sales of strength products 
gross profit margin of our retail business was in  a decrease of percentage points compared to higher gross profit margin in was attributable primarily to adjustments to previously recognized reserves for warranty and freight costs 
operating expenses operating expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to operating expenses of million in operating expenses in included restructuring expenses of million and intangible asset impairment charges of million 
beginning in the fourth quarter of we began to reallocate television media advertising away from home gyms due to declining sales and toward our bowflex treadclimber product line 
we expect to direct an increased portion of our television advertising expenditures toward the treadclimber product line in  in order to build greater customer awareness with the goal of increasing our share of the cardio oriented fitness market 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to advertising expense of our direct business  a component of selling and marketing expenses  in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the comparative decrease in direct advertising expense was primarily attributable to management decision to reduce television media spending in order to balance the ability to convert customer leads into sales in an environment where advertising fees had increased compared to the prior year  while consumer financing approval rates had declined substantially over the same period 
in the number of new unique consumer leads increased on less marketing spend  compared to  due to the strong performance of our new treadclimber television ads 
in addition  marketing expense was million higher in due to media production costs in support of a new product introduction 
beginning in the fourth quarter of we began to reallocate television media advertising away from home gyms due to declining sales and toward our bowflex treadclimber product line

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to  primarily due to cost saving initiatives aimed at reductions in personnel  occupancy cost  insurance expense and outside services costs 
in addition  general and administrative expenses in were reduced by the resolution of legal matters which were settled for million less than the amounts previously estimated 
research and development research and development expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to  consisting of million in cost savings from the consolidation of product development activities at our corporate headquarters and a million decrease in pre production royalty fees paid to outside inventors 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in restructuring no restructuring costs were incurred in in restructuring expense of million included an million impairment charge for abandoned leasehold improvements in space we are no longer using at our vancouver  washington headquarters facility  million in facility lease termination costs and other lease obligations associated with the reduction of leased space at our headquarters facility and our vacated manufacturing and distribution facilities in tulsa  oklahoma  million in charges due to our abandonment of information technology software  contract termination costs of million related to a warehouse distribution service agreement for our us parts  and million in severance costs related to personnel reductions 
intangible asset impairments no asset impairment losses were incurred in in  we recognized impairment losses of million for intangible assets of our retail business 
other income and expense interest expense we incurred interest expense of million in in connection our long term note payable to a related party 
we incurred interest expense of million in in connection with our prior bank financing agreement 
we repaid all amounts outstanding under our prior financing agreement in december and have not borrowed under our current financing agreement with bank of the west 
other income other income was million in  compared to other expense of million in  primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in  compared to income tax benefit of million in income tax expense in primarily relates to taxable income generated in canada 
income tax benefit in was attributable to the carryback of us net operating loss to a prior year  as permitted under a new law enacted in november we increased our valuation allowances in and to reduce us deferred income tax assets generated during the respective years to the amounts expected  more likely than not  to be realized 
as a result  generally we did not recognize us income tax benefits associated with our operating losses in or discontinued operations loss from our commercial business discontinued operation  net of income taxes  was million in  compared to loss from discontinued operations of million in  as we disposed of substantially all of the remaining components of our 
table of contents former commercial business in loss from discontinued operations in is net of a million reduction in the amount of pre tax disposal loss previously estimated in connection with the divestiture of our commercial business 
we expect to dispose of the remaining assets of the commercial business in early and we do not expect disposal loss adjustments in future periods to be material 
we expect loss from discontinued operations to further decrease in as we complete the divestiture  although some expenses may be incurred in in connection with the settlement of contingencies arising from and directly related to our commercial business prior to its disposal 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of december  the principal sources of this increase in cash and cash equivalents were million in proceeds from the sale of our commercial business  a million loan from a related party and million from the reduction of restricted cash  partially offset by million of cash used in operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
we generated positive operating cash flows despite reporting significant net losses in and  primarily by significantly reducing receivables and inventories 
the economy impact on our operating results  especially the impact of decreased availability of credit for our customers  was worse than we anticipated 
while the restructuring strategies we implemented in recent years resulted in substantial cost savings  they did not offset the full impact of the poor economic conditions and our decline in revenues during while our continuing operations were profitable in the fourth quarter of  this period is seasonally strong and our fourth quarter results do not guarantee we will be profitable in the future 
our return to profitability is dependent on numerous factors  including improved us economic conditions  improved availability of credit for our customers  and resumed growth in consumer spending on discretionary goods 
in light of the aforementioned uncertainties  there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient positive cash flows in the future 
within the terms of our loan agreement with bank of the west  we elected to uncollateralize certain standby letters of credit  which released approximately million of previously restricted cash in currently we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our bank loan agreement 
however  there is no assurance that we will remain in compliance with such covenants in the future 
failure to maintain compliance with the covenants might  absent a waiver from the bank  result in an obligation to cash collateralize our standby letters of credit  which totaled million as of december  in september  we completed a borrowing agreement with certain entities under common control of sherborne investors gp  llc and its affiliates  a related party  which provided million in additional cash for our future operating needs 
in addition  we completed our transition to a new primary third party consumer credit financing provider during the third quarter of  which management believes has resulted in the improved availability of credit for our customers and increased sales in our direct business during the fourth quarter of management believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet our expected cash needs for at least the next twelve months  based on cash currently on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations 
despite negative operating cash flows in  management expects to generate adequate operating cash flows during the next twelve months  primarily by reducing losses of our commercial business discontinued operation and improving profit contribution of our direct business through increased sales 
however  there is no assurance that such funds will be sufficient for our operating needs 
cash used in operating activities of million in consisted primarily of losses from continuing and discontinued operations  as adjusted for non cash items  of million and reductions in trade payables and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  partially offset by million from income tax refunds  net of payments  million from the reduction of trade receivables and million from the reduction of inventories 
significant reductions in trade receivables  trade payables and accrued liabilities in largely resulted from winding down our commercial business discontinued operation 
we expect further reductions in accrued liabilities in future periods as we fulfill outstanding liabilities  including product warranty obligations  of our commercial business discontinued operation 
cash provided by operating activities of million in consisted primarily of net reductions in trade receivables and inventories of million and million  respectively  as we reduced working capital invested in our commercial business  which was classified as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of  partially offset by an million reduction in accrued liabilities and losses from continuing and discontinued operations  as adjusted for non cash items  of million 
the reduction in accrued liabilities largely resulted from the fulfillment of outstanding product warranty obligations of our commercial business discontinued operation  particularly the commercial treadclimber tc cardio product  which was discontinued in late  as well as reductions in other accrued liabilities of our discontinued operation 

table of contents the following table presents comparative cash flows related to trade receivables and inventories for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  change trade receivables collections sales on account net cash provided inventories shipments purchases net cash provided cash provided by investing activities of million in included million in proceeds from the sale of portions of our discontinued commercial business and million from a decrease in the amount of restricted cash collateralizing our outstanding letters of credit 
cash provided by investing activities of million in included million in proceeds from the sale of portions of our discontinued commercial business and million in refunds of escrow deposits  partially offset by a million net increase in the amount of restricted cash collateralizing our outstanding letters of credit and million used for purchases of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of million in long term borrowings from a related party  partially offset by million paid for financing costs related to our new bank agreement and long term borrowings 
cash used in financing activities of million in consisted of repayments of borrowings under our former bank agreement  which was fully repaid in december financing arrangements on december   we entered into a letter of credit agreement the letter of credit agreement with bank of america bofa 
the letter of credit agreement provided up to million in standby letters of credit  and was scheduled to expire on december  expiration date 
on december   the letter of credit agreement was modified to reduce the credit limit to million and extend the expiration date to june  during this extended period  bofa will issue no new letters of credit 
existing letters of credit are secured by a cash collateral account held by bofa in an amount not less than of the amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   we had million in standby letters of credit issued under the letter of credit agreement 
on march   we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with bank of the west  providing for a million maximum revolving secured credit line 
the amount available for borrowings in any given quarter is dependent upon the amount of qualified accounts receivable and inventory as of the end of the preceding quarter 
the loan agreement is available for working capital  standby letters of credit and general corporate purposes through august  assuming we satisfy certain terms and conditions at the time borrowings are requested 
the interest rate on any future borrowings under the loan agreement will be based on the bank prime rate or libor and our financial condition at the time we elect to borrow 
the loan agreement includes a fee for the unused portion of the credit facility  which will vary depending on our borrowing base availability 
the loan agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and contains customary covenants  including minimum current ratio  minimum liquidity  minimum ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and limitations on capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  dispositions  dividends and investments 
the loan agreement also contains customary events of default 
upon an event of default  the lender would have the option of accelerating all obligations under the loan agreement 
standby letters of credit under the loan agreement are treated as a reduction of our available borrowing base and are subject to covenant testing 
if standby letters of credit are secured by a cash collateral account held by bank of the west in an amount not less than of the amount of the outstanding letters of credit and there are no outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement  then covenant testing is not applicable 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we completed amendments to the loan agreement which specify separate  more lenient financial covenants  compliance with which permits us to maintain outstanding standby letters of credit without a requirement for cash collateral 
the amendment to the loan agreement restricts our ability to borrow under the loan agreement absent compliance with the pre amendment covenants 
the separate financial covenants are applicable for compliance measurement periods through march  the loan amendment also required us to obtain million of unsecured indebtedness  subordinated to the loan agreement  as additional working capital on or before september  we obtained this indebtedness on september as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and million in standby letters of credit issued under the loan agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants  however  there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants in the foreseeable future such that we could access the credit facility if the need were to arise or  absent a waiver from the bank  avoid cash collateralizing our outstanding letters of credit 
on september   we entered into a note purchase agreement the purchase agreement by and among nautilus and certain entities collectively  the purchasers under common control of sherborne investors gp  llc and its affiliates collectively sherborne 
sherborne is our largest shareholder and is controlled by edward j 
bramson  our chairman and chief executive officer  and craig l 
mckibben  a member of our board of directors 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we issued to the purchasers  in aggregate principal amount at maturity of our increasing rate senior discount notes due december  the notes 
the notes have an original principal amount totaling  and mature on december  the then outstanding principal amount of the notes accretes value at rates equal to per annum from september  through february   per annum from march  through august   per annum from september  through february   per annum from march  through august   and per annum thereafter 
if all the notes are paid at maturity  the effective rate of interest is approximately per annum 
prepayment of amounts due under the notes is permitted under the purchase agreement 
the notes are subordinated to the loan agreement 
the purchase agreement includes certain negative covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  liquidation of assets  capital expenditures  dividends  changes in our business operations and change of control transactions 
the purchase agreement includes customary events of default  including nonpayment  insolvency  breach of warranty or covenant  cross default of the loan agreement  material adverse changes and other events 
upon the occurrence of an event of default the purchasers may declare all outstanding obligations under the notes to be due and payable 
the accretion rate of the notes may be increased by per annum during the continuance of an event of default 
non cancelable contractual obligations our operating cash flows include the effect of certain non cancelable  contractual obligations 
a summary of such obligations as of december   including those related to our discontinued operations  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations total our purchase obligations are comprised of inventory purchase commitments 
because our inventory primarily is sourced from asia  we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 
due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions  have been excluded from the contractual table above 
for further information  see note  income taxes  in notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements prior to its divestiture  our discontinued commercial business would  from time to time  involve a third party with lease and financing arrangements to assist customers in purchasing products 
while most of these financings were without recourse  in certain cases we offered a guarantee or other recourse provisions 
our third party financing provider reviewed customer credit information in evaluating the risk of default prior to extending credit to a customer and we relied on the quality of this review and our own risk assessment in determining whether to proceed with the recourse transaction 
as of december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million 
for further information  see note  commitments and contingencies  in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to the use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with parties to debt arrangements  under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no liabilities are recorded at december  seasonality we expect our sales from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally 
sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters  and are generally weakest in the second quarter 
we believe the broadcast of national network season finales and seasonal weather patterns influence television viewership and cause our television commercials on national cable television to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods of the year 
in addition  during the spring and summer months  consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities  including exercise  which impacts sales of fitness equipment used indoors 
this seasonality can have a significant effect on our operating results  inventory levels and working capital needs 
new accounting pronouncements no new accounting pronouncements had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
