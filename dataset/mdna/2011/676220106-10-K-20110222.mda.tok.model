item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations overview our business is comprised of three segments 
the north american retail division includes our retail office supply stores in the us and canada  which offer office supplies and services  computers and business machines and related supplies  and office furniture 
most stores also offer a copy and print center offering printing  reproduction  mailing and shipping 
the north american business solutions division sells office supply products and services in the us and canada directly to businesses through catalogs  internet web sites and a dedicated sales force 
our international division sells office products and services through catalogs  internet web sites  a dedicated sales force and retail stores 
our fiscal year results are based on a or week retail calendar ending on the last saturday in december 
each of the three years addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is based on weeks 
our next week fiscal year will occur in our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year 
a summary of factors important to understanding our results for is provided below and further discussed in the narrative that follows this overview 
total company sales were billion in  down compared to sales in north america decreased for the year  comparable store sales in the north american retail division decreased 
international division sales decreased in us dollars and in local currencies 
gross margin for improved basis points from  following a basis point increase from the increase in primarily reflects lower occupancy costs  better management of promotional activity and benefits from product line reviews and increased direct imports 
during  we recognized million for impairment of certain software applications  million for net losses on business dispositions  facility closure and severance costs and million associated with the departure of our former ceo and other executive compensation costs 
the per share impact of these items totaled 
as part of our previously announced strategic reviews  we recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively 
these expenses the charges include primarily charges for lease accruals  severance expenses and asset impairments 
charges under these programs ended in during  we recognized significant tax and interest benefits from settlements with tax authorities  resulting in a full year benefit of approximately per share 
during  we recorded a non cash tax expense to establish valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of million per share because of the uncertainty of future realizability of these assets 
at the end of  we had million in cash and approximately million available on our asset based credit facility 
cash flow from operating activities was million for 
table of contents a summary of items above affecting diluted loss per share by year is as follows diluted loss per share less charges credits impairment and other charges tax settlements and related interest prior year charges valuation allowance in addition to the tax settlement and related interest income and expense reversal  which are presented in the table above for the period  the company recognized significant tax benefits from deductions that will be carried back to an earlier tax period 
because the company has valuation allowances in that jurisdiction  these carryback items impact the effective tax rate  and are unusual  but will be received as a tax refund 
accordingly  such benefits have not been included in this presentation 
carryback opportunities will not exist in this jurisdiction for future periods and the company will not be able to recognize originating deferred tax assets until the related valuation allowances are removed 
this accounting will likely adversely impact future effective tax rates 
operating results discussion of other income and expense items  including material charges and changes in interest and taxes follows our review of segment results 
north american retail division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit loss of sales sales in our north american retail division decreased in  in and in during  we closed underperforming stores as part of the strategic review initiated during the fourth quarter of comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased 
transaction counts were lower for the full year  but positive for the third and fourth quarters of average order values declined  reflecting lower sales in our peripherals product category  in part from our reduction in television offerings 
sales in furniture  technology  technology services and copy and print depot increased while sales of supplies declined 
the overall sales declines in both and were driven by macroeconomic factors as consumers and small business customers curtailed their spending in response to the global financial crisis 
while transaction counts were down in compared to  a drop in average order value was the greater contributor to our sales decline 
additionally  our commitment to proactively reduce promotions in select categories resulted in lower sales compared to within each of our three major product categories of supplies  technology and furniture  we experienced sales declines compared to the negative comparable store sales were driven by fewer sales of higher priced  discretionary categories in furniture and technology 
the north american retail division reported operating profit of approximately million in  million in and an operating loss of million in gross margins increased in from lower occupancy costs  lower product cost driven by line reviews and direct import  and better management of 
table of contents promotional activity 
increased advertising expense during was partially offset by lower variable pay 
the increase in division operating profit for was driven by lower asset impairments  an improvement in product margins and lower operating expenses 
the improvement in product margins was driven primarily by a more favorable product mix  lower levels of inventory shrinkage and valuation charges as well as lower product costs 
these product margin improvements were partially offset by the deleveraging of fixed property costs on lower sales levels 
during  we recorded fixed asset impairment charges of approximately million 
store impairment charges in and totaled million and million  respectively 
additionally  as a result of the fixed asset impairments  we experienced lower levels of depreciation expense in and division operating profit in all periods was negatively affected by the unfavorable impact our sales volume decline had on gross margin and operating expenses the flow through impact  with the greatest impact experienced during at the end of  we operated  retail stores in the us and canada 
we opened new stores during and six stores during we closed stores in north america during and during  of which were part of the strategic review initiated during the fourth quarter of we anticipate opening approximately stores in also  we will continue to evaluate locations as leases become due and will close or relocate stores when appropriate 
north american business solutions division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our north american business solutions division decreased in  in and in the restructuring of certain non core businesses in late contributed approximately to the sales decline 
while the economic climate remained challenging in  the rate of our sales decline improved sequentially throughout the year 
sales in the direct channel were negative for the full year  but relatively flat in the third quarter and positive in the fourth quarter 
sales in the contract channel were also lower for the year 
for the division  both the number of customer transactions and the average order value per transaction were lower in compared to on january   our primary purchasing cooperative agreement for public sector customers expired 
we have several other non exclusive arrangements with other cooperative purchasing consortiums and anticipate retaining a substantial amount of our public sector business 
the sales decline was principally driven by a decrease in the number of customer transactions  which resulted in part from aggressive pricing from some of our competitors in our large  national accounts and contraction in our public sector business 
on a product category basis  the division experienced weakness in durables such as furniture  technology and peripherals  as customers delayed their purchases of these products in favor of consumables like paper  ink and toner 
division operating profit totaled million in  compared to million in the flow through impacts of lower sales adversely affected all periods  with the greatest impact in the decrease in operating profit was partially offset by higher gross margins from a shift in the mix of customers  some pricing improvements and product mix 
increased advertising expenses during were offset by initiatives to reduce the division s cost structure and lower variable pay for the period 
in addition to the negative flow through impact in we experienced lower product margins  reflecting a less profitable product mix and cost increases that could not be passed on to our customers 
division operating profit for also reflects increased promotions in our direct business during the first half of the year 
these negative impacts were partially offset by reductions in operating expenses  including a decrease in distribution costs as well as lower payroll and advertising expenses 

table of contents international division dollars in millions sales change change in local currency sales division operating profit of sales sales in our international division in us dollars decreased in  in and increased in local currency sales decreased in  in and in the sales in each of the three years presented were adversely impacted by the global economic climate 
sales in the contract business in local currencies increased in and declined in growth in the small to medium sized business customers and large national account customers offset softness in the public sector business that resulted from various governmental austerity programs enacted throughout the year 
the decrease reflects impacts from larger businesses decreasing their workforces and their discretionary spending on office supplies 
local currency sales in the direct business declined and in and  respectively 
the trend reflects some improvements in sales of higher priced items such as furniture and technology 
we continue to focus on increasing the number of customer transactions 
sales in the retail channel increased after considering the impact of store closings in japan  begun in and completed in early  as well as the fourth quarter transaction related to our stores in israel discussed below 
division operating profit totaled approximately million in  million in and million in included in division operating profit for were charges of approximately million from the sale of operating subsidiaries in israel and japan  as well as facility closure and severance costs associated with consolidation arrangements in europe 
the subsidiary sales reflect the company s decision to change its investment model in those countries from direct operating to license arrangements 
the respective buyers of the entities will operate under the office depot name and the company will continue to generate cash flows from these entities from licensing fees and product sales 
the company may continue efforts to improve financial results through efficiencies and operational consolidation during should such activity be undertaken  additional charges could result 
the decreases in division operating profit in  and were also impacted by the flow through effects of lower sales levels 
the operating profit comparison of to also reflects higher vendor rebates in and higher product costs in that were not passed on to customers  partially offset by lower variable pay 
for  the negative flow through impact was partially offset by lower operating expenses  including a decrease in distribution costs as well as lower payroll and advertising expenses 
other factors  including a shift to lower margin customers and cost increases that could not be fully passed on to our customers  negatively impacted division operating profit in both and during  we also recorded a non cash gain of approximately million related to the curtailment of a defined benefit pension plan in the uk and non cash impairment charges of approximately million related to our customer list intangible assets 
for us reporting  the international division s sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
the division s reported sales were negatively impacted by approximately million in  million in and positively impacted by million in from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
division operating profit was negatively impacted by million in  million in and positively impacted by million in from changes in foreign exchange rates 
internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 

table of contents corporate and other asset impairments  exit costs and other charges each of our three operating segments has been adversely affected by the downturn in the global economy in recent years 
the company has taken actions to adapt to the changing and increasingly competitive conditions including closing stores and distribution centers dcs  consolidating functional activities and disposing of businesses and assets 
during  and  we have recognized significant charges from reorganization efforts and asset impairments 
the charges recognized in and that related to a strategic review were managed at the corporate level and were excluded from measurement of division operating profit 
in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated additional activities to improve future operating performance  change the ownership structure of certain international investments and eliminate non productive corporate assets 
specifically  the company wrote off approximately million of construction in progress related to impairment of certain software applications 
in the fourth quarter of it was determined that the company was no longer going to fund the continued development of this software and the software projects were abandoned 
the charge is presented in other asset impairments on the consolidated statements of operations 
other charges recognized during have been included in division operating profit or corporate general and administrative expenses  as appropriate 
the company expects to take additional actions during the coming years in an effort to increase efficiency and operating results 
these actions could include combining  outsourcing or eliminating functions which could lead to additional charges when the relevant accounting criteria are met 
these actions are still being considered 
a summary of the charges recognized during and and the line item presentation of these amounts in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows 
dollars in millions  except per share amounts cost of goods sold and occupancy costs store and warehouse operating and selling expenses goodwill and trade name impairments other asset impairments general and administrative expenses total pre tax charges income tax effect after tax impact per share impact of the million of charges  approximately million either have or are expected to require cash settlement  including longer term lease obligations that will require cash over multi year lease terms 
the primary components of charges include goodwill and trade name impairments during  we recorded non cash charges of billion to write down goodwill and million related to the impairment of trade names 
our recoverability assessment of these non amortizing intangible assets considered company specific projections  assumptions about market participant views and the company s overall market capitalization around the testing period 
retail store initiatives as part of the strategic review  we closed stores in north america six of which were closed in the fourth quarter of and the remainder in and stores in japan 
the stores closed were underperforming or stores that were no longer a strategic fit for the company 
the charges totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the charges were primarily related to lease 
table of contents accruals  inventory write downs  severance expenses and other facility closure costs 
the charges related primarily to asset impairments  inventory write downs and lease accruals 
supply chain initiatives during  we closed five dcs and six crossdock facilities in north america and consolidated our dcs in europe 
charges related to these actions totaled approximately million in and related primarily to lease accruals  inventory write downs  severance expenses and other facility closure costs 
the charges totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of accelerated depreciation  severance related costs and lease accruals 
asset sales and sale leaseback transactions as a result of the strategic review and to enhance liquidity  we entered into multiple sale and sale leaseback transactions 
total proceeds from these transactions were approximately million and are included in the investing section on our consolidated statement of cash flows 
losses on these transactions are included in the charges and totaled approximately million in gains have been deferred and will reduce rent expense over the related leaseback periods 
headcount reductions and other restructuring activities severance and termination benefit costs associated with actions to centralize activities and eliminate geographic redundancies totaled approximately million and million during and  respectively 
during  we also recorded charges for contract terminations on certain leased assets totaling approximately million and for other restructuring activities totaling approximately million 
additionally  we recognized a non cash loss of approximately million in conjunction with the disposition of other assets during charges for other restructuring activities in totaled approximately million and related primarily to asset write downs and costs associated with the restructuring of our back office operations and call centers in europe 
although we do not expect to recognize new charges under the or earlier programs  positive and negative adjustments to previously accrued amounts as well as accretion on discounted long term accruals such as lease obligations will continue to impact our results in future periods 
we currently estimate accretion of approximately million for and declining amounts in subsequent periods 
all such amortizations and settlements or adjustments to related accruals will be included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses and recognized at the corporate level  outside of division operating profit 
in addition to the charges that relate to the strategic reviews  during  we recognized other material charges because of the downturn in our business 
those charges include material asset impairments relating to stores we continue to operate  charges to impair amortizing customer relationship intangible assets  as well as an increase in our allowance for bad debts related to our private label credit card portfolio and certain other accounts receivable balances to reflect the economic downturn 
as these charges are considered reflective of operating an ongoing business in difficult times  they were included in the division operating results 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses g a decreased to million in from million in the portion of g a expenses considered directly or closely related to division activity is included in the measurement of division operating profit 
the company continues to evaluate g a and other expense allocations across the divisions and may refine methodologies in future periods 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the remainder of the total g a expenses are considered corporate expenses 
a breakdown of g a is provided in the following table dollars in millions division g a corporate g a total g a of sales 
table of contents corporate g a includes charges of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
after considering these amounts  corporate g a expenses decreased million in and increased million in the decrease in was driven by lower variable pay  legal fees and a litigation settlement  partially offset by approximately million of compensation related costs following the departure of our former ceo and higher software amortization 
the change in primarily reflects increased depreciation expense and higher levels of performance based variable pay 
the increase in depreciation expense resulted primarily from the capital lease associated with our new corporate campus as well as the company s implementation of a new enterprise software system which was placed in service at the beginning of the third quarter of the increases were offset partially by reduction in legal and professional fees as well as lower payroll related costs 
corporate g a for also includes approximately million from the effect of accelerated vesting of certain employee stock grants following approval of the redeemable preferred stock issuance 
other income and expense dollars in millions interest income interest expense miscellaneous income  net the increase in interest income during reflects approximately million of interest received on a tax settlement during the year 
the decrease in interest income from to resulted primarily from lower investment rates 
the tax settlement also resulted in reversal of approximately million of previously accrued interest expense  partially offset by lower capitalized interest in compared to our net miscellaneous income consists of our earnings of joint venture investments  gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions  investment results from our deferred compensation plan and realized gains and impairments of other investments 
the majority of miscellaneous income is attributable to equity in earnings from our joint venture in mexico  office depot de mexico 
the increase in reflects a level of foreign currency and deferred compensation plan losses in that did not recur in and receipts on investments previously impaired 
the decrease in primarily reflects lower joint venture earnings resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as well as foreign currency losses 
income taxes dollars in millions income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings loss before income taxes 
the company experienced significant volatility in its effective tax rate throughout and  in large part because of valuation allowances recorded during that limit the impact of deferred tax accounting 
the effective tax rate for includes approximately million from favorable tax settlements  million from the release of a european valuation allowance  million tax benefits on the disposition of operating entities in israel and japan  as well as a tax accounting method change for repairs and maintenance expenses and the impact of bonus depreciation rules enacted during the fourth quarter of in addition to the tax settlement and other discrete items  the company recognized significant tax benefits from deductions that will be carried back to an earlier tax period 
because the company has valuation allowances in that jurisdiction  these carryback items impact the effective tax rate  and are unusual  but will be received as a tax refund 
carryback opportunities will not exist in this jurisdiction for future periods and the company will not be able to recognize originating deferred tax assets until the related valuation allowances are removed 
this accounting will likely adversely impact future effective tax rates 

table of contents valuation allowances totaling million were recognized during  with million related to domestic deferred tax assets and million related to foreign deferred tax assets 
the establishment of valuation allowances and development of projected annual effective tax rates requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates 
both positive and negative evidence  as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence  is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
an accumulation of recent pre tax losses is considered strong negative evidence in that evaluation 
because of the downturn in our performance during this recessionary period  as well as the significant restructuring activities and charges we have taken in response  during the third quarter of the cumulative pre tax results for the past months of certain taxing jurisdictions reached or nearly reached loss positions 
in our view  the recoverability of those deferred tax assets could no longer meet the more likely than not standard that applies to such assets 
significant judgment is also required in determining when it is appropriate to release a previously established valuation allowance 
during  one jurisdiction in europe reached sufficient positive performance and we had reasonable projections that positive performance would continue such that the valuation allowance established in could be reversed 
while it is possible that other european entities could accumulate positive evidence that would support reversing some valuation allowances during  it is not expected that the domestic valuation allowances will be adjusted during the short term consequence of being unable to record deferred tax benefits will continue to cause our effective tax rate to be volatile  possibly changing significantly from period to period 
the effective tax rate reflects the largely non deductible nature of the goodwill impairment charge and non deductible foreign interest  as well as a million increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions 
as discussed in note g to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company maintains accruals for uncertain tax positions and is subject to examinations by various taxing authorities that are expected to be completed over several years 
it is reasonably possible that certain of these audits will close within the next months  which could result in a decrease of as much as million or an increase of as much as million to our accrued uncertain tax positions 
additionally  we anticipate that it is reasonably possible that new issues will be raised or resolved by tax authorities that may require changes to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits  however  an estimate of such changes cannot reasonably be made 
in general  the effective tax rate in future periods can be affected by variability in our mix of domestic and foreign income  the variance of actual results to projected results  utilization of deferred tax assets  the statutory tax rates in various jurisdictions  changes in the rules related to accounting for income taxes  outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process and our assessment of the need for accruals for uncertain tax positions 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   we had approximately million in cash and equivalents and another million available under our asset based credit facility based on the december borrowing base certificate  for a total liquidity of approximately billion 
we consider our resources adequate to satisfy our cash needs at least over the next twelve months

the agreement also contains representations  warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and default provisions which are conditions precedent to borrowing 
the most significant of these covenants and default provisions include a capital expenditure limitation of million in any fiscal year and limitations in certain circumstances on acquisitions  dispositions  share repurchases and payment of cash dividends

the company was in compliance with all financial covenants at december  the facility also includes provisions whereby if the global availability is less than million  or the european availability is below million  the company s cash collections go first to the agent to satisfy outstanding borrowings 
further  if total availability falls below million  a fixed charge coverage ratio test is required which could effectively eliminate additional borrowing under the facility 
any event of default that is not cured within the permitted period  including non payment of amounts when due  any debt in excess of million becoming due before the scheduled maturity date  or the acquisition of more than of the ownership of the company by any person or group  could result in a termination of the facility and all amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable

the maximum month end and monthly average amounts were million and respectively  both occurring in the month of august 
the maximum month end and monthly average amounts includes debt related to two operating subsidiaries in the international division that were sold during the fourth quarter of the majority of these short term borrowings represent outstanding balances on uncommitted lines of credit  which do not contain financial covenants

as of december   purchase obligations include television  radio and newspaper advertising  sports sponsorship commitments  telephone services  certain fixed assets and software licenses and service and maintenance contracts for information technology 
contracts that can be unilaterally terminated without a penalty have not been included 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million classified as deferred income taxes and other long term liabilities 
this caption primarily consists of our net long term deferred income taxes  the unfunded portion of our pension plan  deferred lease credits  liabilities under our deferred compensation plans  and accruals for uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain 
as of december   accruals for uncertain tax positions  net of items offset by net operating losses  totaled approximately million 
see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and accruals for uncertain tax positions and note i for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the pension plan and the deferred compensation plan 
the table above includes scheduled  acquisition related payments 
in addition to the above  we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements our inventory purchases from vendors are generally under arrangements that automatically renew until cancelled with periodic updates or annual negotiated agreements 
many of these arrangements require the vendors to make payments to us or provide credits to be used against purchases if and when certain conditions are met 
we generally refer to these arrangements as vendor programs  and they typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the first category is volume based rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
many of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined tier  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases 
table of contents until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for our estimates of purchase volume 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief at any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
during  the company expanded the number of arrangements that eliminated this tiered purchase rebate mechanism in exchange for a lower price throughout the year 
an increase in these arrangements could further reduce the potential variability in gross margin from changes in volume based estimates 
the second broad category of arrangements with our vendors is event based programs 
these arrangements can take many forms  including advertising support  special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  and various other special programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
some arrangements may meet the specific  incremental  identifiable cost criteria that allow for direct operating expense offset  but such arrangements are not significant 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for certain of our activities that lower the vendors cost to ship their product to our facilities 
vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates and amounts due from vendors are generally settled throughout the year based on purchase volumes 
the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are settled within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we monitor active inventory for excessive quantities and slow moving items and record adjustments as necessary to lower the value if the anticipated realizable amount is below cost 
we also identify merchandise that we plan to discontinue or have begun to phase out and assess the estimated recoverability of the carrying value 
this includes consideration of the quantity of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of current and projected market conditions 
if necessary  we record a charge to reduce the carrying value of this merchandise to our estimate of the lower of cost or realizable amount 
additional promotional activities may be initiated and markdowns may be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
we also recognize an expense in cost of sales for our estimate of physical inventory loss from theft  short shipment and other factors referred to as inventory shrink 
during the year  we adjust the estimate of our shrink rate accrual following on hand adjustments and our physical inventory results 
these changes in estimates may result in volatility within the year or impact comparisons to other periods 
during  we lowered our inventory levels to lessen working capital requirements and reduce obsolescence risk 
also  following a strategic review of our business in december  we decided to close certain underperforming stores in north america 
to facilitate these closures  we contracted with a liquidation firm that guaranteed the amount to be realized for the inventory in those stores 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million charge to adjust that inventory to the net contracted value 
that adjustment had no impact on the remaining inventory in other stores or in our supply chain 
during  we completed the closure of stores in north america and japan and certain dcs 
in conjunction with these closures  we recognized an 
table of contents additional million charge to facilitate inventory liquidation 
the company has no current plans for significant additional closures that could result in similar charges  though some level of closures should be anticipated each year 
closed store accruals and asset impairments we regularly assess the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales levels  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain operating performance targets  we may decide to close the store 
when a store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
in conjunction with the strategic review initiated in the fourth quarter of  we closed stores in north america and stores in japan 
the lease related costs associated with these closures  which totaled approximately million and million in and  respectively  were recorded as the facilities closed 
these costs were calculated based on our assumption of an extended vacancy period  three years in most cases  reflecting the slow economic conditions and the estimated sublease rates available in the future 
these commitments with no economic benefit to the company were discounted at the credit adjusted discount rate at the time of each location closure 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
because the and facility closures are considered part of a company wide business review  the accretion of the discounted lease liability and potential future positive and negative adjustments to the recorded amounts from settlements or changes in market conditions will be recognized at the corporate level  outside of the determination of division operating profit 
residual costs and benefits of closures from other periods are included in division operating profit 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
our impairment analysis builds a cash flow model at the individual store level  beginning with recent store performance and trending the anticipated future results based on chain wide and individual store initiatives 
if the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets and the fair value of the store s assets is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
during  we recognized impairment charges of approximately million  which were primarily driven by the significant economic downturn 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in our tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the realization of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
because of the downturn in our performance during this recessionary period  as well as the significant restructuring activities and charges we have taken in response  we established valuation allowances totaling approximately million during the charge to establish the valuation allowance followed the third quarter condition of reaching or nearly reaching a month cumulative loss position in two taxing jurisdictions 
judgment is required in projecting when operations will be sufficiently positive to allow a conclusion that utilization of the deferred tax assets will once again be more likely than not 
positive performance 
table of contents in subsequent periods and projections of future positive performance will need to be evaluated against this existing negative evidence 
a valuation allowance in one foreign jurisdiction was removed during  resulting in recognition of a million tax benefit 
our effective tax rate in future periods may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in related judgments or pre tax operations 
deferred tax assets without valuation allowances remain in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly  with the cumulative effect of a change in the anticipated annual rate reflected in the tax provision of that period 
such changes can result in significant interim reporting volatility 
for example  during  our effective tax rate  separate from discrete items  changed each quarter 
we began the year at an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately and ended at approximately for the fourth quarter and full year of this volatility reflected changes in our projected earnings levels  the mix of income  carryback opportunities and the impact of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities  may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax position is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
preferred stock paid in kind dividends in june  we issued million of redeemable preferred stock 
the preferred stock carries a stated dividend of  subject to future decreases in certain circumstances  and allows for payment in cash or an increase in the preferred stock s liquidation preference 
the valuation for accounting purposes of the dividend paid in kind requires significant judgment to determine the estimated fair value 
the company has used a binomial simulation model to measure values of multiple possible outcomes of the various provisions in the agreements that could impact whether the dividend rate would change based on future stock price performance  whether the company would issue a notice to call the preferred shares and whether the holders would convert their preferred stock into common stock 
while the fair value of preferred stock dividends paid in kind has no standing in the contractual rights to liquidation preference of the preferred shareholders nor any cash impact on the company  it impacts the measurement of net income available to common shareholders and reduces earnings per share 
changes in the valuation assumptions such as the risk adjusted rate  stock price volatility and time to call or convert can impact the estimated fair value and therefore the amount reported as net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share 
however  the valuation is most sensitive to changes in the underlying common stock price 
the company believes the model used to estimate fair value is reasonable and appropriate  but the reported dividend amount could change significantly in future periods based on changes in the underlying common stock price and the model inputs 
the company paid all preferred stock dividends accrued for in cash 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties competitive factors over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
warehouse clubs have expanded beyond their in store assortment by adding catalogs and web sites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered 
we also face competition from other office supply stores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery 
table of contents chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them also feature technology products 
many of them may price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry that could impact our results 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry that could impact our results 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
economic factors our customers in the north american retail division and the international division and many of our customers in the north american business solutions division are predominantly small and home office businesses 
accordingly  these customers may continue to curtail their spending in reaction to macroeconomic conditions  such as changes in the housing market and commodity costs  higher credit costs  credit availability and other factors 
the downturn in the global economy experienced over the past two years negatively impacted our sales and profits 
liquidity factors historically  we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business 
together  these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs  as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings  capital improvements and acquisitions 
however  due to the downturn in the global economy our operating results have diminished 
in june  we issued million of redeemable preferred stock and in september  we entered into a billion asset based credit facility to provide liquidity 
there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be adversely impacted by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
in addition  deterioration in our financial results could negatively impact our credit ratings 
the tightening of the credit markets or a downgrade in our credit ratings could make it more difficult for us to access funds  to refinance our existing indebtedness  to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or to obtain funding through the issuance of securities 
market sensitive risks and positions the company has adopted an enterprise risk management process patterned after the principles set out by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso in management utilizes a common view of exposure identification and risk management 
a process is in place for periodic risk reviews and identification of appropriate mitigation strategies 
we have market risk exposure related to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodities 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate changes on obligations may result from external market factors  as well as changes in our credit rating 
we manage our exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates  foreign currency rates  or commodities is not permitted 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash  cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of less than million 
market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below dollars in thousands carrying value fair value risk sensitivity carrying value fair value risk sensitivity million senior notes asset based credit facility the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
while our company sells directly or indirectly to customers in countries  the principal operations of our international division are in countries with euro  british pound and mexican peso functional currencies 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our pretax earnings of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we also are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
at december   the notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures was million 
this amount was million at its highest point during also  from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward transactions to protect against possible changes in exchange rates related to scheduled or anticipated cash movements among our operating entities 
generally  we evaluate the performance of our international businesses by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is impacted by external factors 
commodities risk we operate a large network of stores and delivery centers around the globe 
as such  we purchase significant amounts of fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers as well as pay shipping costs to import products from overseas 
we are exposed to potential changes in the underlying commodity costs associated with this transport activity 
as of december   a change in domestic commodity costs would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat 
table of contents seasonal  with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter  following the back to business sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the back to school sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles 
business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods 
new accounting standards there are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the financial accounting standards board has issued proposed accounting rules relating to leasing transactions that  if passed in their current form  would have significant impacts to our financial statements 
among other things  the current proposal would create a right of use asset and corresponding liability on the balance sheet measured at the present value of minimum lease payments  record amortization of the right of use asset and implied interest of the liability on the statement of operations and characterize a portion of the lease payments as financing activities rather than operating activities on the statement of cash flow 
these proposed changes in accounting rules would have no direct economic impact to the company
