critical accounting policies and estimates this section describes our critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates that we have made in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in lexington  massachusetts  focused on the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs in the acute care environment 
such products are used primarily in hospitals but also may be used in acute care settings including home infusion and hospital outpatient clinics 
the following table sets forth our total net revenues  net income and net income per share for the periods presented for the years ended december  in millions  except per share data total revenues  net net income basic net income per common share diluted net income per common share our net income includes an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

table of contents we had a total of million in cash  cash equivalents and investments as of december   as compared to million as of december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of the notes  resulting in net proceeds to cubist  after debt issuance costs  of million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase  in privately negotiated transactions  million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes 
cubist repurchased the notes at an average price of approximately per par value of debt plus accrued interest of million and transaction fees of million  resulting in a cash outflow of million 
the repurchase resulted in a net loss of million for the year ended december  see note m  debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
cubicin 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from cubicin  which we launched in the us in november and currently commercialize on our own in the us cubicin is a once daily  bactericidal  iv antibiotic with activity against mrsa  and  as of december   has been used in the treatment of more than an estimated million patients with serious infections caused by gram positive pathogens such as mrsa 
cubicin is approved in the us for the treatment of csssi caused by s 
aureus  and certain other gram positive bacteria  and for s 
aureus bloodstream infections bacteremia  including those with rie caused by methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant isolates 
in the eu cubicin is approved for the treatment of cssti where the presence of susceptible gram positive bacteria is confirmed or suspected and for rie due to s 
aureus bacteremia and s 
aureus bacteremia associated with rie or cssti 
the following is a breakdown of our revenues from cubicin for the years ended december  in millions worldwide product revenues  net us product revenues  net international product revenues our worldwide net product revenues for cubicin represent net us product revenues and international product revenues  which relate to the payments we receive from international distributors in connection with their commercialization of cubicin 
international product revenues are primarily based on sales of cubicin by novartis which sells cubicin through a subsidiary  our distribution partner in the eu 
we expect both net revenues from sales of cubicin in the us and our revenues from cubicin sales outside the us to continue to increase due primarily to increased vial sales  market penetration into a large market  and price increases we and our international partners may implement 
there are a number of events  trends and uncertainties that are impacting or may impact our revenues from cubicin and the growth of such revenues 
the more significant of these events  trends and uncertainties are described below  and these  and certain other risks and uncertainties applicable to cubicin  are set forth in the risk factors section of this document our patent infringement lawsuit against teva  as described below  and our ability to otherwise obtain  maintain and enforce us and foreign patent protection for cubicin  price increases that we have implemented for cubicin  the lack of overall growth in the market for cubicin  and the evolving profile of competitors  persisting economic problems  which are leading to increased efforts by hospitals and others to minimize expenditures by encouraging the purchase of lower cost alternative therapies  including 
table of contents generic products like vancomycin  patients electing lower cost alternative therapies due to increased out of pocket costs  patients choosing to have fewer elective surgeries and other procedures  and lower overall admissions to hospitals  our work with the supplier of our cubicin api to complete the expansion of the capacity at the facility at which it manufactures cubicin api  including the receipt of any related required regulatory approvals  on a timely basis and our ability to otherwise secure sufficient quantities of cubicin to meet demand  changes in reimbursement levels for pharmaceuticals  and higher discount and rebate levels for sales under federal government programs due to health care reform 
on february   we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from teva notifying us that teva had submitted an anda to the fda for approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
teva notice letter advised that it is seeking fda approval to market daptomycin for injection  the active ingredient in cubicin  prior to the expiration of us patent nos 
 and  which expire on september   and us patent no 
re  which expires on june  each of these patents is listed in the fda orange book 
the notice letter further stated that teva is asserting that claims in the referenced patents are not infringed and or invalid 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against teva  teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in response to the anda filing 
the complaint  which was filed in the us district court for the district of delaware  alleges infringement of the referenced patents 
under current us law  the filing of the lawsuit automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda for months from our receipt of teva paragraph iv notification letter on february   unless the court enters judgment in favor of teva in less than months or finds that a party has failed to cooperate reasonably to expedite the lawsuit 
the court has set a date for trial beginning on april  the court also issued its claims construction order on june  on june   teva filed a motion for leave to amend its answer to allege that us patent nos 
 and  are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct 
on september   the court granted teva motion for leave to amend  and on september   teva filed its amended answer alleging that us patent nos 
 and  are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct 
on october   the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order regarding infringement wherein teva agreed  for purposes of the litigation  that teva proposed labeling induces infringement of the claims of us patent nos 
 and  that cubist is asserting in the lawsuit  however  teva is continuing to assert that those claims are invalid and unenforceable 
on october   the court signed the infringement stipulation 
the court has indicated that summary judgment motions will not be permitted in this lawsuit 
our ability to continue to generate significant revenues from cubicin is dependent upon our ability to prevail in the litigation with teva or to otherwise resolve the litigation on favorable terms 
an adverse result in the teva litigation  whether appealable or not  will likely cause our stock price to decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  it is possible that additional third parties may seek to market generic versions of cubicin in the us by filing an anda 
merrem iv from july through june  we promoted and provided other support for merrem iv  an established carbapenem class iv antibiotic  in the iv under a commercial services agreement with astrazeneca 
astrazeneca provided marketing and commercial support for merrem iv we recognized revenues from this agreement as service revenues  based on a baseline payment from astrazeneca to us  adjusted up or down by a true up payment or refund based on actual us sales of merrem us exceeding or falling short of the established baseline sales amount 
the agreement with astrazeneca  as amended  expired in accordance with its terms on june  
table of contents product pipeline 
we are building a pipeline of acute care therapies through our business development efforts and progressing compounds into clinical development that we have developed internally 
cxa in december  we acquired calixa and with it  rights to cxa  an iv combination of a novel anti pseudomonal cephalosporin  cxa  which calixa licensed from astellas  and the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam 
under the astellas license agreement  as amended  we have the exclusive rights to manufacture  market and sell any eventual products which incorporate cxa  including cxa  in all territories of the world except select asia pacific and middle eastern territories  and to develop such products in all territories of the world 
we are developing cxa as a first line therapy for the treatment of certain serious gram negative bacterial infections in the hospital  including those caused by mdr  p 
aeruginosa 
in june  we completed the phase clinical trial of cxa for cuti  and all study objectives were met  resulting in our making a million milestone payment to calixa former stockholders 
we currently are enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial of cxa for the treatment of ciai 
this multicenter  double blind  randomized study is comparing the safety and efficacy of cxa to an active comparator in patients with ciai 
we expect to announce the results of this trial in the second half of assuming positive results in this trial  we expect to initiate phase trials with cxa in both cuti and ciai by year end we expect to file an nda for two initial indications in cuti and ciai by the end of  assuming positive phase clinical trial results in both indications 
we also are planning to pursue the development of cxa as a potential treatment for hap and vap and expect to begin clinical trials of cxa in these indications in pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  which is summarized in note d  business combinations and acquisitions  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we paid the calixa stockholders million  as adjusted and as subject to escrow provisions  and calixa became our wholly owned subsidiary 
we also may be required to make up to an additional million of undiscounted payments to the former stockholders of calixa in the event that certain development  regulatory  and commercial milestones related to cxa  or other products that incorporate cxa  are achieved 
these potential milestone payments are considered a contingent consideration liability and are recognized at their estimated fair value of million and million on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value as of december   factors in the payment of a million milestone to the former stockholders of calixa in june estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant assumptions primarily relating to expectations regarding the probability of achieving certain development  regulatory  and sales milestones  the expected timing in which these milestones will be achieved  and a discount rate 
the use of different assumptions could result in a materially different estimate of fair value 
refer to the critical accounting policies and estimates of this md a for more information 
in addition to the milestone payments we may be required to make to the former stockholders of calixa  we have an obligation to make milestone payments to astellas under the astellas license agreement that could total up to million if certain specified development and sales events are achieved 
the potential development and sales milestone payments to astellas are not considered a contingent consideration liability and will instead be expensed as incurred to research and development and cost of product revenues  respectively 
in addition  if licensed products are successfully developed and commercialized in our territories  we will be required to pay astellas tiered single digit royalties on net sales of such products in such territories  subject to offsets under certain circumstances 
cb  cb  is a potent  oral  cidal lipopeptide with rapid in vitro bactericidal activity against c 
difficile  which is an opportunistic anaerobic gram positive bacterium which causes cdad 
in april  we began a phase clinical trial of cb  for the treatment of cdad 
we expect to complete enrollment and provide top line results for this trial in the second half of the recent 
table of contents increase in severity of cdad  due to newer strains that produce higher levels of toxins  has exposed shortcomings in the standard of care therapy  including reduced susceptibility and recurrence rates of greater than for standard of care therapy 
recent years have witnessed the emergence of a hypervirulent strain of c 
difficile that produces much higher levels of toxins 
this strain also demonstrates high level resistance to fluoroquinolones  which may have contributed to its spread throughout the us  canada  the uk  the netherlands and belgium 
physicians have noted an increase in incidence and mortality rates as well as increases in numbers of patients requiring emergency colectomy removal of all or part of the colon or admission to intensive care units 
pre clinical programs 
we are also working on several pre clinical programs  addressing areas of significant medical needs in the acute care area 
these include therapies to treat various serious bacterial infections and agents to treat acute pain 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues the following table sets forth revenues for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions us product revenues  net international product revenues service revenues other revenues total revenues  net product revenues  net cubist net revenues from sales of cubicin  which consist of us product revenues  net  and international product revenues  were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
gross us product revenues totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in gross us product revenues was due to increased vial sales of cubicin in the us  which resulted in higher gross us product revenues of million  and to price increases for cubicin in june and april  which resulted in million of additional gross us product revenues 
gross us product revenues are offset by allowances for sales returns  medicaid rebates  chargebacks  discounts and wholesaler management fees of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in allowances against gross product revenue was primarily driven by increases in medicaid rebates and pricing discounts due to increased us sales of cubicin and the price increases described above 
in addition  medicaid rebates also increased as a result of health care reform  which increased the amount of medicaid rebates and the number of individuals eligible to participate in the medicaid program 
international product revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  consisted primarily of payments received by us from novartis for selling cubicin to novartis for sale in the eu and royalty payments from novartis based on cubicin net sales in the eu 

table of contents we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and out patient administration location purchases of our product 
we pay certain wholesalers various fees for data supply and administration services 
net product revenue is reduced by any such fees 
service revenues service revenues for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively  and related to our exclusive agreement with astrazeneca to promote and provide other support in the us for merrem us the agreement  as amended  expired in accordance with its terms at the end of june service revenues from merrem iv of million for the year ended december   represent i million related to us sales of merrem us and ii a million payment reflecting the percentage of gross profit from us merrem us sales that we received in for sales in exceeding the annual baseline sales amount 
us sales of merrem iv did not exceed the established annual sales amount in as such we did not receive a gross profit percentage payment for sales in costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development contingent consideration n a sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly  costs to procure  manufacture and distribute cubicin  and the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets 
our gross margin for the year ended december   was  as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of product revenues of million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to the increase in sales of cubicin in the us we expect our gross margin percentage in to be similar to our gross margin percentage in 
table of contents research and development expense total research and development expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to i a decrease of million in license and collaboration expenses related to upfront payments made in for the alnylam and hydra license and collaboration agreements as compared to  when we did not make any such upfront payments  ii a decrease of million in clinical expenses related to the discontinuation of ecallantide in march and a decrease of million in clinical expenses related to cubicin  and iii a decrease of million in stock based compensation charges in as compared to  when we incurred such charges related to the acquisition of calixa 
these decreases were partially offset by i an increase of million in clinical expenses primarily related to cxa  ii an increase of million in process development expenses related to cxa  iii an increase of million in payroll  benefits and other employee related expenses due to an increase in headcount  iv an increase of million in professional fees  and v an increase of million in non clinical expenses and lab services 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the increase in expense is expected to be driven by continued investment in process and development activities of our pipeline  particularly clinical activities related to the development of cxa  clinical trial expenses  including the cost to purchase the material for use in these clinical trials  and research and development milestone payments anticipated to be made under the calixa acquisition agreement 
contingent consideration expense contingent consideration expense was million and zero for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this expense represents the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability relating to potential remaining amounts payable to calixa former stockholders upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones  pursuant to our agreement to acquire calixa in december the change in the fair value for the year ended december   relates to the time value of money 
there was no other change in fair value between the acquisition date of december   and december  contingent consideration expense may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on changes in estimates  including probabilities associated with achieving the milestones and the period in which we estimate these milestones will be achieved 
we expect that contingent consideration expense will significantly increase in as a result of our expectations regarding the clinical development of cxa described in the overview section of this md a  which would increase the fair value of the contingent consideration liability relating to potential amounts payable to calixa former stockholders because progress in the clinical development of cxa will increase the likelihood that we would make these contingent payments 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily related to an increase in payroll  benefits and other employee related expenses as a result of the expansion of our sales staff 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in professional services and consulting charges  including 
table of contents legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation with teva and its affiliates  partially offset by transaction costs of million incurred in related to our acquisition of calixa that did not recur in we expect selling  general and administrative expense in to increase  in the aggregate  primarily due to an increase in salaries  benefits and employee related expenses due to additional headcount hired throughout and planned new hires during we expect that the increase will partially be offset by less than a full year of fees and expenses related to the patent infringement litigation with teva 
other income expense  net the following table sets forth other income expense  net for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense total other income expense  net interest income interest income for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income is primarily due to a higher average invested cash balance in as compared to interest expense interest expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense is due to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of our notes in october interest expense includes million of amortization of a debt discount during the year ended december   relating to both our notes and notes in accordance with accounting guidance for debt with conversion and other options 
in accordance with such accounting guidance  the notes were bifurcated between liability million as of october  the date of issuance and equity million as of the date of issuance components in a manner that reflects the issuer non convertible debt borrowing rate of similar debt 
the equity component of million was recognized as a debt discount and represents the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the notes and the fair value of the liability at the date of issuance 
this debt discount is amortized to the consolidated statement of income over the expected life of a similar liability without the equity component 
also included in interest expense is approximately million of debt issuance costs written off as a result of the repurchase of million of our notes in october we expect interest expense to increase in due to the increase in the principal amount and aggregate interest rate of our outstanding convertible debt resulting from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of our notes in october and repurchase of million 
table of contents aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes 
see note m  debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the following table summarizes our interest expense for the periods presented for the years ended december  in millions contractual interest coupon payments amortization of debt discounts amortization of the liability components of debt issuance costs total interest expense other income expense other expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in other expense for the year ended december   primarily relates to i a million loss on the partial extinguishment of our notes in october  and ii million of net foreign exchange losses for certain available for sale investments denominated in euros  which are re measured at the end of each period 
the increase was partially offset by million of gains related to our five auction rate securities  which were sold in december see note e  investments  and note m  debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
provision for income taxes the following table summarizes the effective tax rates and income tax provisions for the periods presented for the years ended december  in millions  except percentages effective tax rate provision for income taxes for the year ended december   the difference between the effective tax rate of and the us federal statutory income tax rate of is primarily the result of state income taxes of  non deductible contingent consideration of related to our acquisition of calixa in december  and the impact of the extension of the federal research and development tax credit of 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was  for which the difference from the statutory rate primarily relates to a million net income tax benefit for discrete items related to the termination of the development of the hepatitis c virus compound that we had acquired through our acquisition of illumigen in december this net benefit included the write off of our tax investment in illumigen net of the write off of illumigen federal nol carryforwards 
cubist and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the us federal government and with multiple state and local jurisdictions in the us changes in the effective tax rates from period to period may be significant as they depend on many factors including  but not limited to  changes in circumstances surrounding the need for a valuation allowance  size of our income or loss  or one time 
table of contents activities occurring during the period 
if certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones are achieved with respect to cxa  or other products that incorporate cxa  we have committed  under the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired calixa in december  to make future milestone payments to the former stockholders of calixa 
contingent consideration expense related to potential future milestone payments will have a negative impact on our effective tax rate in the year they are recorded as they are not deductible expenses for tax purposes 
we expect that our effective tax rate will significantly increase in as a result of our expectations regarding the clinical development of cxa described in the overview section of this md a  namely  that we would make certain milestone payments to the former stockholders of calixa and recognize the related contingent consideration expense in  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  we maintain a valuation allowance primarily relating to losses incurred on the auction rate securities  which were sold in in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we have considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  we consider our recent history of earnings  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
based upon the level of our recent history of taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are utilizable  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

table of contents million of amortization and accretion of our investments and million of contingent consideration expense attributable to our acquisition of calixa in december the million increase in the change in assets and liabilities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily the result of an increase of million in prepaid clinical expenses related to our agreement with our third party service provider of cxa clinical trials  as well as an increase of million in prepaid income taxes

net cash used in investing activities in consisted of purchases of million in investments  offset by proceeds of million from our investments  including million received from the sale of our auction rate securities in december net cash used in investing activities in also included million of purchases of property and equipment  primarily related to the construction of approximately  square feet of laboratory space and associated administrative space at our facilities at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts 
net cash used in investing activities in consisted of million for the acquisition of calixa  and also included the purchase of million in investments  offset by proceeds of million from our investments  and the purchase of million of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities in included the payment of million to former shareholders of illumigen  which we acquired in december net cash used in investing activities in also included million of purchases of property and equipment  including million of assets related to the construction of approximately  square feet of additional laboratory space at our main building at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  as well as approximately million of assets related to renovating additional leased space at the and hayden avenue building in lexington  massachusetts 
we estimate that capital expenditures for will be in the range of million to million  primarily driven by facility and leasehold improvements and the work to expand our facility at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  as well as an investment in laboratory equipment  information technology solutions and enhancements to support the needs of an expanding business 
in addition  we expect an increase in expenditures related to the expansion at the manufacturing facility of our cubicin api supplier 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was million  as compared to million provided by financing activities in and million used in financing activities in net cash provided by financing activities in included cash received from the issuance of million of our notes  offset by repayment of million in aggregate principal of our notes  as discussed below  and million of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes 
net cash provided by financing activities also included cash received from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in also included million of cash used to repurchase million of our notes 
in october  we completed a registered public offering of million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes are convertible into common stock i subsequent to march   provided the sales price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified length of time  ii prior to may   provided that the trading price per  note was less than of the product of the last reported sales price of our common stock and the conversion rate  or iii prior to may   should we elect to issue substantially all rights  options or warrants to purchase common stock at a price per share less than the average of the last reported sales 
table of contents price for a certain period of time 
the initial conversion rate of the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment upon certain events  which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
interest is payable on each may st and november st  beginning may  we used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes at an average price of approximately per par value of debt 
see note m  debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
investments in december  we sold our five auction rate securities with an original par value of million in exchange for proceeds of million 
we recognized a gain of million in other income expense within the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  we also have investments in money markets  bank deposits  corporate notes  us treasury securities and us government agency securities  of which million are classified as short term investments as of december  see note e  investments  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
credit facility in december  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with rbs citizens for general corporate purposes 
under the revolving credit facility  we may request to borrow at any time a minimum of million up to the maximum of the available remaining credit 
the facility will be secured by the pledge of a certificate of deposit issued by rbs citizens and or an rbs citizens money market account equal to an aggregate of of the outstanding principal amount of the loans  so long as such loans are outstanding 
interest on the borrowings can be calculated  at our option  based on libor plus a margin or the prime rate 
any borrowings under the facility are due on demand or upon termination of the revolving credit agreement 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of december    or repurchases of common stock  convertible subordinated notes or convertible senior notes outstanding from time to time  our board of directors may authorize us to repurchase shares of our common stock or our outstanding notes and notes in privately negotiated transactions  or publicly announced programs 
if and when our board of directors should determine to authorize any such action  it would be on terms and under market conditions that the board of directors determines are in the best interest of our company 
any such repurchases could deplete some of our cash resources 
in october  we used a portion of the net proceeds received from the offering of the notes to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes at an average price of approximately per par value of debt 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings on february   we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from teva notifying us that teva had submitted an anda to the fda for approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
teva notice letter advised that it is seeking fda approval to market daptomycin for injection  the active ingredient in cubicin  prior to the expiration of us patent nos 
 and  which expire on september   and us patent no 
re  which expires on june  each of these patents is listed in the fda orange book 
the notice letter further stated that teva is asserting that claims in the referenced patents are not infringed and or are invalid 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against teva  teva pharmaceuticals 
table of contents usa  inc and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in response to the anda filing 
the complaint  which was filed in the us district court for the district of delaware  alleges infringement of the referenced patents 
under current us law  the filing of the lawsuit automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda for months from our receipt of teva paragraph iv notification letter on february   unless the court enters judgment in favor of teva in less than months or finds that a party has failed to cooperate reasonably to expedite the lawsuit 
the court also has set a date for trial beginning on april  the court also issued its claims construction order on june  on june   teva filed a motion for leave to amend its answer to allege that us patent nos 
 and  are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct 
on september   the court granted teva motion for leave to amend  and on september   teva filed its amended answer alleging that us patent nos 
 and  are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct 
on october   the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order regarding infringement wherein teva agreed  for purposes of the litigation  that teva proposed labeling induces infringement of the claims of us patent nos 
 and  that we are asserting in the lawsuit  however  teva is continuing to assert that those claims are invalid and unenforceable 
on october   the court signed the infringement stipulation 
the court has indicated that summary judgment motions will not be permitted in this lawsuit 
our ability to continue to generate significant revenues from cubicin is dependent upon our ability to prevail in the litigation with teva or to otherwise resolve the litigation on favorable terms 
an adverse result in the teva litigation  whether appealable or not  will likely cause our stock price to decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  it is possible that additional third parties may seek to market generic versions of cubicin in the us by filing an anda 
we have retained the services of wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp  or wilmerhale  to represent us in the anda litigation 
we have entered into a fee arrangement with wilmerhale under which we will pay wilmerhale a fixed monthly fee over the course of the litigation and a potential additional payment that could be due to wilmerhale based on the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit 
we are accruing amounts due to wilmerhale based on our best estimate of the fees that we expect to incur as services are provided 
based on the nature of this fee arrangement  we could incur legal fees in excess of amounts accrued as a result of future events 
business agreements upon achievement of certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our various business agreements  including license  collaboration and commercialization agreements 
see note c  business agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our business agreements 
contingent consideration if certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones are achieved with respect to cxa  or other products that incorporate cxa  we have committed  under the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired calixa in december  to make future milestone payments to the former stockholders of calixa 
in june  we completed the phase clinical trial of cxa for cuti and all study objectives were met  resulting in our making a million milestone payment to calixa former stockholders 
in accordance with accounting for business combinations guidance  this contingent consideration liability is required to be recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
we also may be required to make up to an additional million of undiscounted payments to the former stockholders of calixa 
the estimated fair value of these payments  after adjustments for probabilities of success and a discount factor  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the fair value of contingent 
table of contents consideration is required to be reassessed at each reporting period  with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
the decrease of million in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability reflects a million milestone payment to calixa former stockholders  which was paid in june  partially offset by million of contingent consideration expense recorded during the year ended december   as a result of the time value of money 
as of december   the contingent consideration related to the calixa acquisition is our only financial liability measured using level inputs in accordance with accounting guidance for fair value measurements and represents of the total financial liabilities measured at fair value 
see note d  business combinations and acquisitions  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities  such as royalties on future sales above the contractual minimums and potential milestone payments  including contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of calixa  as we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future payments 
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of million also have been excluded from the table below due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period year or less years years more than years total in millions convertible senior and subordinated notes interest on convertible senior and subordinated notes operating leases royalty payments due inventory purchase obligations clinical trial payment obligations other purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the convertible senior and subordinated notes consist of a remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes  due in november  and a remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes  due in june the notes require semi annual interest payments beginning in may through maturity  and the notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
our operating leases consist of approximately  square feet of office and data center space at and hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in september for approximately  square feet  and april for approximately  square feet 
the royalty payments listed above represent amounts expected to be owed to eli lilly on sales of cubicin as of december  committed payments do not reflect the impact of royalties on future sales of cubicin because we are unable to predict total cubicin sales on which royalties would be due with certainty 
the inventory purchase obligations listed above represent purchases for the manufacturing of cubicin api by our supplier  acsd  as well as payments for converting cubicin api into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation 
the clinical trial payment obligations listed above primarily represent amounts owed to our cros  and independent clinical investigators related to clinical trials of candidates in our product pipeline  as well as amounts owed to our 
table of contents third party service provider for the purposes of conducting clinical trials on our behalf related to cxa we executed an agreement with this service provider in november under which payments are expected to be made through the other purchase obligations listed above primarily represent expected future payments for continued expansion of our facilities in lexington  massachusetts  for which we entered into a final design and construction agreement with our design builder in november to construct an additional  square feet of laboratory and associated administrative space expected to be completed in other purchase obligations also include payments pursuant to research funding and collaboration agreements and payments related to the expansion at acsd cubicin api manufacturing facility  as described below 
we have a manufacturing and supply agreement with acsd which was amended in november under this amendment  we and acsd have agreed to a a project plan for the process  equipment and associated plant improvements and expansion to acsd cubicin api facility intended to increase the capacity of the facility and the reimbursement to acsd for certain costs associated with these activities  b a new cubicin api pricing schedule based on payments in euros to acsd that can be updated in the event that future facility or process improvements are implemented  and c a new minimum order requirement structure based on a percentage of our cubicin api requirements rather than an absolute annual minimum 
the acsd inventory purchase commitments  which are included in inventory purchase obligations  and the expected payments for the reimbursement of costs related to the acsd expansion  which are included in other purchase obligations  have been translated to us dollars using the exchange rate between us dollars and euros at december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements  including off balance sheet arrangements as described in sec regulation s k item as such we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  clinical research costs  investments  property and equipment and other intangible assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  and business combinations 

table of contents i 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin in the us  revenues derived from sales of cubicin by our international distribution partners  license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaboration  license and distribution agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and  from july to june  service revenues derived from our promotion and support of merrem iv through june in all instances  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
us product revenues  net all us product revenues are recognized upon delivery 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees and medicaid rebates in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
instead  we maintain a drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and acute care settings 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and acute care settings purchases of our product and also prevents unusual purchasing patterns since it closely tracks end user demand 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date of the product 
our estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including industry data of product return rates  historical experience of actual returns  analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if the history of our product returns changes  the reserve may be adjusted 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking and activity and provisions for returns which will be based on our estimates of product in the distribution channel that may not sell through to end users 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves quarterly 
our reserves for chargebacks and for our traditional base of medicaid rebates have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for known end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid rebates based on an analysis of customer sales mix data to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of rebate or chargeback can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate or chargeback adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
under health care reform  rebate eligibility was extended  effective march   to include drugs issued to medicaid patients who are covered by mcos that service medicaid populations under individual agreements with states 
as there is not yet any meaningful historical data for medicaid rebates applicable to this added population  the reserve estimation methodology cannot be used 
instead  we have accessed state by state medicaid enrollment records from public and private sources and used them to estimate i the number of medicaid beneficiaries in the populations for which we have most recently received and paid rebate claims and ii the number of medicaid beneficiaries in the medicaid mco populations for which we have not yet begun to pay rebates 
with this information  we then estimated our additional rebate liability by i taking the population for which 
table of contents rebates are not yet being claimed  ii determining the ratio of that population to the population for which we are paying rebates  iii applying that ratio to the dollar amount of the reserve requirement for rebates we are already paying  and iv making a final adjustment to reflect estimated differences in the rates of acute drug usage between the two populations 
we anticipate being able to move away from this methodology as we collect historical data by receiving new medicaid mco rebate claims from the various states 
reserves for medicaid rebate programs are included in accrued liabilities and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks and wholesaler management fees are offset against accounts receivable and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the years ended december   and  provisions for sales returns  chargebacks  medicaid rebates  wholesaler management fees and discounts that were offset against product revenues totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model in which we currently operate  and our experience to date of actual product returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
international product revenues we sell our product to international distribution partners based upon a transfer price arrangement that is generally established annually 
once cubist distribution partner sells the product to a third party  we may be owed an additional payment or royalty based on a percentage of the net selling price to the third party  less the initial transfer price previously paid on such product 
under no circumstances would the subsequent adjustment result in a refund to the distribution partner of the initial transfer price 
we recognize the additional revenue upon receipt of royalty statements from our distribution partners 
service revenues from july through june  we promoted and provided other support for merrem iv  an established carbapenem class iv antibiotic  in the us under a commercial services agreement with astrazeneca 
astrazeneca provided marketing and commercial support for merrem iv we recognized revenues from this agreement as service revenues  based on a baseline payment from astrazeneca to us  adjusted up or down by a true up payment or refund based on actual us sales of merrem iv exceeding or falling short of the established baseline sales amount 
the agreement with astrazeneca  as amended  expired in accordance with its terms on june  service revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
service revenues from merrem iv for the year ended december   represent i million related to us sales of merrem iv and ii a million payment reflecting the percentage of gross profit from us sales of merrem us that we received during the first quarter of for sales in exceeding the annual baseline sales amount  which was recorded in the first quarter of us sales of merrem us in were below the established annual sales amount 
as such we did not receive any gross profit percentage payment for sales in other revenues other revenues include revenue related to upfront license payments  license fees and milestone payments received through cubist license  collaboration and commercialization agreements 
we 
table of contents analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting 
license revenues non refundable license fees for out license of our technology are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement 
we recognize non refundable upfront license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and the fair value of cubist undelivered obligations  if any  can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of our performance for such undelivered items or services 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations of cubist are recorded as deferred revenue once received and generally are recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligation only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered by us 
our assessment of our obligations and related performance periods requires significant management judgment 
if an agreement contains research and development obligations of cubist  the relevant time period for the research and development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized  and as a result  management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of research and development on a quarterly basis 
milestones revenue from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
contingent payments under license agreements that do not involve substantial effort on our part are not considered substantive milestones 
such payments are recognized as revenue when the contingency is met only if there are no remaining performance obligations or any remaining performance obligations are priced at fair value 
otherwise  the contingent payment is recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo basis 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value to the extent of any excess amount  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements  or inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of  and the related costs are written off to cost of product revenues 
charges for inventory write downs are not reversed if it is later determined that the product is saleable 
therefore  any such written down inventory would be sold at significantly higher margin 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents iii 
clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
we defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made by us for research and development activities  including clinical research activities  until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income 
contracts and studies vary significantly in length  and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs that have a dollar limit cap  and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies to the extent possible through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope  and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
clinical trial expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
given our expectations regarding the advancement of our pipeline programs  particularly cxa  we expect that clinical trial expenses will increase significantly in the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of each study  the required level of patient enrollment  and the number of sites involved in each study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require significantly high patient enrollment rates  have complex patient screening requirements or that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
iv 
investments investments with original maturities of greater than days and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
our short term investments include bank deposits  corporate notes  us treasury securities  and us government agency securities 
long term investments include corporate notes  us treasury securities and us government agency securities 
investments are considered available for sale as of december  and  and are carried at fair value 
auction rate securities were included in long term investments at december  in december  we sold the five auction rate securities we held since and recognized a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  in accordance with fair value measurement guidance  we categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to estimate fair value  which may be based on observable and or unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect certain market assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy level is determined by asset class based on the lowest level of significant input 
as of december   the fair value estimates for our investments utilize observable inputs and are categorized as either level or level of the fair value hierarchy  which is described in note f  fair value measurements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party pricing service 
the pricing service uses various market inputs to determine value  including trade information  broker or dealer quotes  bids  offers  market interest rates or a combination of these data 
table of contents sources 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing service by obtaining and analyzing market data from other pricing sources 
on july   we adopted accounting guidance which amends previous guidance pertaining to the evaluation and accounting for embedded credit derivative features  including those in collateralized debt obligations  which impacted the accounting for the auction rate securities we held 
as a result  we recorded a million net cumulative effect adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit primarily related to unrealized gains on our auction rate securities as of the date of adoption 
see note e  investments  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses  dividends  interest income and declines in value judged to be other than temporary credit losses are included in other income expense 
amortization of any premium or discount arising at purchase is included in interest income 
v 
property and equipment and other intangible assets in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate property and equipment using the straight line method over the asset estimated economic life  which range from three years to years 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of our corporate headquarters building located at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from four years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain long lived assets are impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition 
vi 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a deferred tax asset is established for the expected future benefit of nol and credit carryforwards 
a valuation reserve against net deferred tax assets is required if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents in accounting for uncertain tax positions  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
any changes to these estimates  based on the actual results obtained and or a change in assumptions  could impact our income tax provision in future periods 
interest and penalty charges  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as a provision for income tax in the consolidated statement of income 
at december   we have accrued interest of million related to uncertain tax positions 
prior to the fourth quarter of  all of our deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance recorded against them 
until this time  we determined that based on our historical tax position and operational results  realization of our deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not standard under the guidance for accounting for income taxes 
in the fourth quarter of  upon reviewing factors such as prior consistent profitability  our ability to utilize nol carryforwards and forecasts of future profitability  we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was no longer required 
we recognized a tax benefit of million during the year ended december   as a result of the reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
see note n  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
vii 
stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based employee compensation  including restricted stock units  over the employees service periods  which are generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based option awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the option award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the stock based award and expected forfeiture rates 
the fair value of each stock based award is expensed under the straight line method 
in order to determine the fair value of option awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  estimated option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
estimating forfeitures also requires significant judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on both current and historical volatilities of our stock  which are obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based on the exercise behavior and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of stock based pre vesting cancellations 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred stock based compensation costs of million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents viii 
business combinations on december   we acquired calixa for total consideration of million  consisting of a cash payment of million  as adjusted  and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million 
we allocated the value of the purchase price of million  as adjusted  to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the purchase price was adjusted during the measurement period to reflect information existing at the acquisition date that became available post acquisition concerning the tax basis of the acquired assets and liabilities 
goodwill of million was initially recognized on the date of acquisition and purchase accounting adjustments of million were recorded through the measurement period 
there was no impact to the statements of income for these adjustments 
the difference between the total fair value of consideration transferred and the purchase price relates to million of charges primarily related to stock based compensation recognized in the postcombination period ended december   resulting from the settlement of calixa unvested equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition  as adjusted in the manner described above december  in thousands cash investments ipr d deferred tax assets goodwill other assets acquired total assets acquired deferred tax liabilities other liabilities assumed total liabilities assumed total net assets acquired ipr d the intangible assets identified of million are ipr d assets relating to cxa for pneumonia  cuti and ciai indications 
cxa is an iv administered combination of calixa novel antipseudomonal cephalosporin  cxa  and the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam 
cxa is being developed as a potential first line iv therapy for the treatment of ciai  cuti  hap  and vap 
we completed a phase clinical trial of cxa for cuti in june and currently are conducting a phase clinical trial of cxa in ciai 
we expect to announce the results of this trial in the second half of assuming positive results in this trial  we expect to initiate phase trials with cxa in both cuti and ciai by year end we also are planning to pursue the development cxa as a potential treatment for hap and vap and expect to begin clinical trials of cxa in these indications in as of the date of acquisition  the intangible asset related to cxa for hap and vap had an estimated fair value of million  and the intangible assets related to cxa for cuti and ciai had an estimated fair value of million 
we assessed the fair value of ipr d assets using an income method approach  including discounted cash flow models that are probability adjusted for assumptions relating to the development and potential commercialization of 
table of contents cxa for the indications described above 
the valuation model used to estimate the fair values of cxa indications reflects significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate a drug development asset  including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval  market size and market growth projections  estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to advance cxa to commercialization  estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales  and a discount rate 
the use of different assumptions or changes in assumptions used could result in materially different fair values 
upon acquisition  ipr d assets are recorded at their acquisition date fair value 
until the underlying project is completed  these assets are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
once the project is completed  the carrying value of the ipr d is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
if a project becomes impaired or is abandoned  the carrying value of the ipr d is written down to its revised fair value with the related impairment charge recognized in the period in which the impairment occurs 
if the fair value of cxa in the indications described above becomes impaired as the result of unfavorable data from any ongoing or future clinical trial  changes in assumptions that negatively impact projected cash flows  or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing cxa for any of these indications  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present  using projected discounted cash flow models 
the valuation techniques utilized in performing impairment tests incorporate significant assumptions and judgments to estimate the acquisition date fair value  as described above 
the use of different valuation techniques or different assumptions could result in materially different fair value estimates 
post acquisition research and development expenses related to the ipr d projects are expensed as incurred 
development of cxa for the indications described above requires various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it could be commercialized in the us or other territories 
the estimated research and development cost to advance cxa to commercialization ranges from million to million for the cuti and ciai indications and from million to million for the pneumonia indications 
these amounts represent management best estimate of expected costs  but are subject to change based on additional information to be received as development activities advance 
assuming successful results in clinical trials and regulatory approval  we expect to commercially launch cxa with cuti and ciai indications in and with the pneumonia indications in the successful development of new pharmaceutical products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
given these uncertainties  there can be no assurance that cxa will be successfully developed for these indications or  if successfully developed  that it will be developed in the timeframes described above or within the cost ranges described above 
if such development is not successful or completed in a timely manner or is more expensive than currently anticipated  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for cxa or for the calixa acquisition as a whole 
contingent consideration if certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones are achieved with respect to cxa  or other products that incorporate cxa  we have committed  under the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired calixa in december  to make future milestone payments to the former stockholders of calixa 
in june  we completed the phase clinical trial of cxa for cuti and all study objectives were met  resulting in our making a million milestone payment to the former stockholders of calixa 
as of december   we also may be required to make up to an additional million of undiscounted payments to the calixa stockholders 
the estimated fair value of these payments  after adjustments for probabilities of success and a discount 
table of contents factor less milestone payments made  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the assumptions used in estimating fair value  including probabilities of successfully achieving the milestones  the estimated timing in which the milestones are achieved and the discount rate require significant judgment 
the use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value 
see note d  business combinations and acquisitions  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
various analyses  assumptions and estimates were made as of the date of acquisition of calixa in determining the value of goodwill 
when we perform impairment tests in future years  changes in forecasts and estimates from those used at the acquisition date could result in impairment charges that would be recognized in the consolidated statement of income at that time 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendment specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendment also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under current accounting guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendment is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for goodwill impairment tests 
the amendment modifies step of the impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for annual excise taxes paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers under health care reform 
the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying branded prescription drug sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable 
the amendment is effective for calendar years beginning after december   when the fee initially becomes effective 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the adoption of this amendment on our results of operations or financial condition 
in march  the fasb reached a consensus to issue an amendment to the accounting for revenue arrangements under which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations to a customer over a 
table of contents period of time  when the deliverable or unit of accounting is not within the scope of other authoritative literature  and when the arrangement consideration is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone 
the amendment defines a milestone and clarifies whether an entity may recognize consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the amendment may be applied retrospectively to all arrangements or prospectively for milestones achieved after the effective date 
we have not adopted this guidance early and adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment details additional disclosures on fair value measurements  requires a gross presentation of activities within a level roll forward  and adds a new requirement to the disclosure of transfers in and out of level and level measurements 
the new disclosures are required of all entities that are required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this amendment was effective as of january   with an exception for the gross presentation of level roll forward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and for interim reporting periods within those years 
the adoption of the remaining provisions of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this amendment provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangements should be separated  and how the consideration paid should be allocated 
as a result of this amendment  entities may be able to separate multiple deliverable arrangements in more circumstances than under existing accounting guidance 
this guidance amends the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services based on objective evidence and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the existing guidance previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item reflect the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this amendment will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption and retrospective application is also permitted 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance on a prospective basis on january   the effect of which will be dependent on the terms of any new or materially modified arrangements subsequent to adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  which may include bank deposits  money market instruments  securities issued by the us government and its agencies  and investment grade corporate bonds 
these investments are primarily denominated in us dollars  with limited investments denominated in euros 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we currently own securities that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective in managing our cash is to preserve capital and provide adequate liquidity to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive securities are held for trading purposes 
in december  we sold our five auction rate securities with an original cost of million in exchange for proceeds of million 
the potential change in the fair value of our fixed rate investments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical 
table of contents adverse basis point movement would result in a decrease in fair value of million and million on our fixed rate investments at december  and  respectively 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of the notes due november  resulting in net proceeds to cubist  after debt issuance costs  of million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase  in privately negotiated transactions  million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes due june our fixed rate notes and notes are carried at cost  net of a debt discount  on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the fair value of the notes and notes was estimated by us to be million and million  respectively 
we determined the estimated fair value of the notes and notes by using quoted market rates 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the fair value of our notes and our notes would decrease approximately million and million  respectively  at december  if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the fair value of our notes would decrease approximately million at december
