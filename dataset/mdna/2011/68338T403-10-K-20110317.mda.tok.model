item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidate financial statements and accompanying notes hereto 
management overview results and priorities revenue for the fourth quarter of decreased compared to the fourth quarter of sequential quarter revenue decreased due to lower client retention rates and the transition to a targeted account sales and marketing strategy 
revenues for were million  representing an increase of over revenue grew year over year as the revenue recognition cycle on accounts signed in positively impacted growth rates in the first half of annual contract value  or acv  represents the aggregate annual revenue value of the company s subscription contracts 
acv decreased to million from million in the previous quarter  and from million in the same year ago quarter 
a significant driver of acv is annual contract value per client  or acvc  which grew to  up compared to the fourth quarter of acvc improved in  in part by targeting more strategic clients and because non renewals were weighted toward non strategic companies with lower contract values 
annual net loss was  for  compared to a net loss of  for the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the  internal use software abandonment which was partially offset by a  improvement in cost of revenue discussed in more detail in the consolidated results of operations section below 
at december   we had  clients  a decrease of compared to  at december  the year over year decrease in the customer base is primarily attributed to a decline in client retention rates among non strategic clients  and lower client acquisition rates as we transition to a targeted accounts sales model 
approximately of lost clients were in non strategic markets 
we are focused on the following priorities for reduce costs we have rationalized our cost structure and have identified million in annual cost reductions  much of which is reflected in our fourth quarter run rate 
in addition  we completed a very significant infrastructure investment cycle in the fourth quarter of and we are now positioned to reduce our capital investment by million in these activities are expected to reduce total cash spending by nearly million in compared to the prior year  transform our small and medium business  or smb  sales organization previously  this team was a transactional team  and we are transforming it into a consultative sales force focused on a very targeted market 
we are identifying companies that have a strategic  long term interest in the public sector  and we have vertically organized our account teams by industry to better connect with our customers 
the success of this strategy will be measured each quarter by the change in contract value for each new customer we acquire from the targeted accounts strategy  expand distribution of onvia content through channel sales programs and partnerships our strategy is to leverage our content and technology investment over a much wider market without losing our focus on our target market 
potential strategic partners include trade publishers  lead generation companies  database companies  franchises and business intelligence providers 
the success of this initiative will be measured by our ability to grow content license contract value and to sign up new strategic partnerships in  develop and execute an enterprise sales and marketing program this program is directed to the largest companies that offer the most business potential for onvia 
on february   john besteman joined us as our vp of enterprise sales 
john has an extensive background in both enterprise selling and the information services industry and we expect john to help us expand our enterprise business in the years ahead  and institute a market driven product development process and expand the applications available to our customers today most of our customers use our database to generate public sector sales leads 
our content and technology platform are key assets that can be leveraged to deliver more strategic applications for our customers 
these future applications may include competitive analysis  channel partner selection and evaluation  market sizing  allocation of marketing spend  and pricing analyses 
this plan is designed to build a profitable and sustainable business model to drive stockholder value and customer satisfaction 
we will report our progress on these five initiatives every quarter 
application of critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significan t unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from subscriptions  content licenses and management reports 
our subscriptions are generally annual contracts  however  we also offer  on a limited basis  extended multi year contracts to our subscription clients  and content licenses are generally multi year agreements 
subscription and content licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also generate revenue from fees charged for management reports  document download services  and list rental services  and revenue from these types of services is recognized upon delivery  or  if report refreshes are included  ratably over the service period 
our subscription services and management information reports are also sold together as a bundled offering 
pursuant to the provisions of accounting standard codification  or asc  revenue recognition  we allocate revenue from these bundled sales ratably between the subscription services and the management reports based on their relative fair values  which are consistent with established list prices for those offerings 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu amends the criteria for separating deliverables  and measuring and allocating arra ngement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
we have adopted the amendments in this asu for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  we do not believe adoption will materially impact reported revenue 
unearned revenue consists of payments received for prepaid subscriptions  as well as the invoiced  but unpaid  portion of subscriptions and content licenses whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date 
internal use software we account for the costs to develop or obtain software for internal use in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other subtopic internal use software 
as a result  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage 
amortization of these costs begins once the product is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product  typically to years 
the amount of costs capitalized within any period is dependent on the nature of software development activities and projects in each period 
during we abandoned  related to internal use software 
during the second quarter of  we abandoned three internal use software projects 
the abandoned assets related to code developed for our commercial sector information  search engine marketing  and internal cross system integration 
during the second quarter  management made the decision to no longer append contact and project specific information to our commercial sector content 
this decision was made as a result of our change to focus exclusively on the gbusiness sector and to no longer position private sector data as a differentiator within our gbusiness solution 
without this actionable contact and project specific information  we do not believe there is future value a ssociated with this content 
this project represents of the total abandoned costs 
the  in abandonments represents the full unamortized value of these assets and these amounts are included in operating expenses under the general and administrative category in the year ended december  non cash stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation according to the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of our stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including employee class and historical experience 
there is also significant judgment required in the estimation of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted 
please refer to the discussion of valuation assumptions in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information on the estimation of these variables 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record accounts receivable for the invoiced portion of our contracts once we have a signed agreement and amounts are billable under the contract 
all of our subscription contracts are non cancellable upon activation 
we do not record an asset for the unbilled or unearned portion of our contracts 
accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value  after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts 
such allowances are determined based on a review of an aging of accounts and reflect either specific accounts or estimates based on historical incurred losses 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain clients may be aff ected 
consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenue subscription content license management information reports other total revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing expenses technology and development expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net loss comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenue growth was driven by the revenue recognition cycle on accounts signed in  which positively impacted growth rates in the first half of prior to july  onvia s target market was very broad 
as a result  the company acquired many clients without an established public sector trategy 
acquisition of these clients increased in due to enthusiasm for the american recovery and reinvestment act 
as a result  top line revenue growth accelerated in  but has subsequently declined because these first year  non strategic clients are driving overall cl ient retention below historical rates 
our revenue growth has been further impacted by lower acquisition sales as we narrow our target market and transition to our new sales and marketing strategy 
cost of revenue cost of revenues for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue our cost of revenue primarily represents payroll related expenses associated with the research and aggregation of the data in our proprietary database and third party content fees  and also includes credit card processing fees 
the decrease for the comparable periods was primarily due to decreases of  in payroll related expenses   decrease in third party content costs due to a change in our production systems  essentially replacing full time staff with task based services from specialized vendors  and  in credit cards fees 
payroll expenses decreased as a result of a decline in weighted average headcount in our content team to during  compared to in headcount decreased as a result of higher utilization of third party content aggregators 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the increase in expenses for the comparable periods is comprised of  in amortization expense due to the launch of several new internally developed technology platforms and products   in marketing costs primarily as a result of increased search engine marketing costs  non capitalizable website costs and increased public relations activity   in travel and entertainment due to increased travel to enterprise customers  and  in severance expenses due to the departure of our senior vice president of sales and chief solution officer 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in commission expenses due to lower sales in the last three quarters of compared to the same period in weighted average headcount in our sales and marketing teams was during the twelve months ended decembe r   compared to in the same period in technology and development technology and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the increase in expenses for the comparable twelve month periods is attributed to an increase of  in contract labor for post implementation maintenance activities on the new technology platform and products  which are not capitalizable  an increase of  in amortization from internal use software and software licenses related to the launch of new platforms and products  and a  reduction in capitalization of payroll related internal use software costs 
weighted average headcount in our technology and development teams was during the year of  compared to in general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the increase in expenses is primarily related to  internal use software abandonment  an increase of  in payroll related costs due to an increase in headcount  and an increase of  in severance expenses primarily related to our former chief executive officer s transition agreement  and separation agreements for our former senior vp of technology  production and information 
weighted average headcount in this group was and in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in headcount is partially attributable to a reclassification of two employees who were included in sales and marketing and one employee who was included in technology and development in the prior period 
these increases were offset by a decrease of  in business taxes mostly due to a wash ington state tax refund associated with a reapportionment of prior year in state revenues  and a  decrease in bad debt expense 
other income  net other income  net consists of interest earned on our investment accounts  interest expense associated with capital leases and other miscellaneous income or expense 
other income  net was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we moved a portion of our investments into fdic insured or us government backed short term securities  which carry a slightly higher return than the money market funds 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
utilization of the nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section of the code  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
we are in the process of performing a section analysis regarding ownership changes that may have occurred  but at this time we cannot reasonably estimate whether such a change has occurred 
any nol carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
we currently have a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets as the future realization of the tax benefit is not more likely than not 
based on information currently available  and until the section analysis is completed  we cannot reasonably estimate whether the unrecognized tax benefit will change significantly within the next twelve months 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our combined cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   and our working capital was million 
from december  to december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million for the reasons described below under operating  investing and financing activities 
we have rationalized our cost structure and have identified million in annual cost reductions  much of which is reflected in our fourth quarter run rate 
in addition  we completed a very significant infrastructure investment cycle in the fourth quarter of and we are now positioned to reduce our capital investment by million in these activities are expected to reduce total cash spending by nearly million in compared to the prior year 
as we continue to execute on our targeted accounts strategy  we may experience a short term decrease in sales and cash flow in the near term 
in addition  renewal rates for non strategic companies during were below historical rates and may remain below historical rates for this segment of our client base as we focus our efforts on medium and large businesses 
we expect  however  that over the longer term  focusing on targeted accounts will result in improved retention rates and acv and  ultimately  increased sales  cash flow and operating income 
until such time as we are able to generate recurring positive cash flow and earnings  we will utilize our revenue  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments to fund operations 
we have established more stringent policies for granting extended payment terms for our clients in light of increasing default rates on subscriptions with these types of terms 
the continuingly difficult economy has triggered an increase in requests for delayed payment terms  such as quarterly payment terms 
if we reduce the availability of credit to our clients  they may refuse to purchase and our operating cash flow may be adversely impacted in the near term  however  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund current operations for the near term foreseeable future 
in may  michael pickett  our former chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board  exercised  options 
mr 
pickett surrendered  shares subject to the options to satisfy the exercise price of the options and the tax withholding obligations resulting from the exercise 
the tax obligation associated with this exercise was approximately  and we settled this obligation in may this payment is presented under financing activities on the statement of cash flows 
pursuant to mr 
pickett s transition agreement  we made a transition payment of  on march  in october   eric t 
gillespie  our former senior vice president  products  technology and information  resigned 
pursuant to mr 
gillespie s separation and release agreement  we made payments totaling  for severance and accrued but unused vacation in november in november   michael s 
balsam announced his resignation as chief strategy officer of onvia  effective december  pursuant to mr 
balsam s transition services agreement he was entitled to a transition payment and accrued but unused vacation totaling  which was paid on december   subject to all required or agreed upon deductions and withholdings 
if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders or may include securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available  or that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year decrease is primarily due to a decrease in sales during  which resulted in a decrease in prepaid subscriptions deferred revenue  as well as an increase in operating expenses in as discussed above 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  we purchased million in short term investments and  in long term investments during the twelve months of compared to million in short term investments for the same period of  all of which were matured or sold in during the twelve months of we received million from the sale and maturity of investments  compared to million during the same period of purchases of property and equipment and investments in our technology platform increased by  in the twelve months of compared to the same period in in addition   of our security deposit on the lease for our corporate headquarters was returned to us in both march and march financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared  for the year ended december  the increase in cash used is primarily due to tax obligations associated with mr
