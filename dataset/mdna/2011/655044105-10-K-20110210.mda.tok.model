item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk and insurance program 
our operations in the deepwater gulf of mexico  as well as onshore us and international locations  could be adversely affected by future changes in laws and regulations which may occur as a result of the deepwater horizon incident 
the legislative and regulatory response to the deepwater horizon incident is ongoing and may not be limited to the us 
in  the us department of the interior issued new rules designed to improve drilling and workplace safety  and various congressional committees began pursuing legislation to regulate drilling activities and increase liability 
in january  the president s national commission on the bp deepwater horizon oil spill and offshore drilling released its report  recommending that the federal government require additional regulation and an increase in liability caps 
the european commission has recommended that new legislation be enacted to enhance the safety of offshore oil and gas activities 
additional regulatory review  slower permitting processes and increased oversight will likely result in longer development cycle time for our deepwater gulf of mexico projects 
cycle time is the length of time it takes for a project to progress from first discovery to first production  and longer development cycle times could result in lower rates of return on our investments 
increased regulation could also have a negative impact on our planned deepwater gulf of mexico exploration program 
a significant delay or cancellation of planned exploratory activities will reduce our longer term ability to replace reserves  resulting in a negative impact on production over time 
to the extent current exploration activities are significantly delayed  a gap could occur in our long term production profile with a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows 

table of contents additional legislation or regulation is being discussed which could require each company doing business in the gulf of mexico to establish and maintain a higher level of financial responsibility under its certificate of financial responsibility cofr  a certificate required by the oil pollution act of which evidences a company s financial ability to pay for cleanup and damages caused by oil spills 
there have also been discussions regarding the establishment of a new industry mutual fund in which companies would be required to participate and which would be available to pay for consequential damages arising from an oil spill 
these and or other legislative or regulatory changes could require us to maintain a certain level of financial strength and may reduce our financial flexibility 
we are monitoring legislative and regulatory developments  however  the full legislative and regulatory response to the incident is not yet known 
an expansion of safety and performance regulations or an increase in liability for drilling activities may have one or more of the following impacts on our business increase the costs of drilling exploratory and development wells  cause delays in  or preclude  the development of our projects in the deepwater gulf of mexico or other locations  result in higher operating costs  divert cash from our capital investments program in order to maintain minimum financial levels or participate in a mandatory industry mutual clean up fund  increase or remove liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills  and limit our ability to obtain additional insurance coverage  at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return  to protect against any increase in liability 
any of the above operating or financial factors may result in a reduction of our cash flows  profitability  and the fair value of our properties or reduce our financial flexibility 
because we strive to achieve certain levels of return on our projects  an increase in financial responsibility requirements could result in certain of our planned projects becoming uneconomic 
derivatives regulation included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  which was passed by congress and signed into law in july  contains significant derivatives regulation  including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post cash collateral commonly referred to as margin for such transactions 
the act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions 
the act requires the commodities futures and trading commission cftc to promulgate rules to define these terms 
the cftc is in the process of proposing definitions to determine which entities will face additional requirements for clearing  trading and posting of margin 
however  the process is incomplete and we are unsure how these definitions will apply to us 
we use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected production in order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows relating to the marketing of our production and in support of our capital investment program 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances 
as commodity prices increase or interest rates decrease  our derivative liability positions increase  however  none of our current derivative contracts require the posting of margin or similar cash collateral when there are changes in the underlying commodity prices or interest rates that are referred to in these contracts 
depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the cftc  we could be required to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our dealer counterparties for our derivative transactions 
a sudden  unexpected margin call triggered by rising commodity prices or falling interest rates would have an immediate negative impact on our business plan  forcing us to divert capital from exploration  development and production activities 
requirements to post cash collateral could not only cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our flexibility in using our cash and other sources of funds such as our credit facility  but could also cause us to incur additional debt 
in addition  a requirement for our counterparties to post cash collateral would likely result in additional costs being passed on to us  thereby decreasing the effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability 
we face various risks associated with the trend toward increased activism against oil and gas exploration and development activities 
opposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in oecd countries which include the us  the uk and israel 
companies in the oil and gas industry  such as us  are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non governmental organizations regarding safety  human rights  environmental compliance and business practices 
anti development activists are working to  among other things  reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as offshore drilling or the development of oil shale 
for example  environmental activists have recently challenged decisions to grant air quality permits for offshore drilling and have advocated for increased regulations on shale drilling in the us 
future activist efforts could result in the following delay or denial of drilling permits  shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size  restrictions on installation or operation of gathering or processing facilities  restrictions on the use of certain operating practices  such as hydraulic fracturing  legal challenges or lawsuits  damaging publicity about us  increased costs of doing business  reduction in demand for our products  and other adverse affects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production 

table of contents our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
slower economic growth rates in the us and other countries in which we operate may materially adversely impact our operating results 
the us and other economies are recovering from a global financial crisis and recession which began in growth has resumed  but has been modest and at an unsteady rate 
there are likely to be significant long term effects resulting from the financial crisis and recession  including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than what was experienced in the years leading up to the crisis  and more volatility may occur before a sustainable  yet lower  growth rate is achieved 
in addition  the oecd has encouraged countries with large federal budget deficits  such as the us  to initiate deficit reduction measures 
such measures  if they are undertaken too rapidly  could further undermine economic recovery and slow growth by reducing demand 
global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources  including fossil fuels 
a lower future economic growth rate is likely to result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production 
a decrease in demand  excluding changes in other factors  could potentially result in lower commodity prices  which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability 
failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties 
our exploration  development  and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures especially in the case of our major development projects  such as the central dj basin  galapagos in the deepwater gulf of mexico  aseng and alen  offshore equatorial guinea  and tamar  offshore israel 
significant capital investments on these major development projects are estimated to total approximately billion in however  first production from the major offshore projects is not expected to occur until galapagos begins to produce in late or early historically  we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations  our revolving bank credit facility and debt issuances 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  such as the level of production from existing wells  prices of crude oil and natural gas  and our success in finding  developing and producing new reserves 
if revenues were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or decreased production  and our access to debt or capital were limited  we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves  resulting in lower production over time 
if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital investment program  we may not be able to access capital markets on an economic basis to meet these requirements 
if we are not able to fund our capital expenditures  our ownership interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a result 
commodity and interest rate hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
in order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas  we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges  consisting of a series of contracts  are limited in duration  usually for periods of one to three years 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil and natural gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements 
global commodity prices fluctuated significantly in such volatility challenges our ability to forecast and  as a result  it may become more difficult to manage our hedging program 
in trying to manage our exposure to commodity price risk  we may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate in the future 
in addition  hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances 
interest rates are also variable and we may also end up hedging too much or too little when we attempt to effectively fix cash flows related to interest payments on an anticipated debt issuance 
we cannot assure that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of volatility in crude oil or natural gas prices or interest rates
