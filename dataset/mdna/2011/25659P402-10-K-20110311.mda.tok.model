item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent acquisitions below 
our industries professional services our professional services division consists of two operating segments mortgage default processing services and litigation support services 
our mortgage default processing services segment comprises the operations of ndex 
our litigation support services segment comprises the operations of discoverready  our discovery management and document review services business  and counsel press  our appellate services business 
we provide these support services to the legal profession  including in house corporate counsel with respect to discoverready 
in addition  ndex also provides its services directly to mortgage lenders and loan servicers on california and nevada foreclosure files 
companies are increasingly looking for ways to control legal costs and for legal work to be performed by the lowest cost high quality provider 
we believe that law firms are under intense pressure to increase efficiency and reduce costs while fulfilling the growing demands of clients 
we further believe that outsourcing has become an increasingly attractive choice for law firms as they identify functions outside of their core competency of practicing law that can help them manage their costs 
mortgage default processing services the outsourced mortgage default processing services market is highly fragmented  and we estimate that it primarily consists of back office operations of approximately local and regional law firms throughout the united states 
we believe that large case volumes and rising client expectations provide an opportunity for default processors that provide efficient and effective services on a timely basis 
we believe that residential mortgage delinquencies will remain high in due to the continued high unemployment rate and the number of homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their home is worth due to deterioration in the residential real estate markets  as well as the re setting of interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages 
compounding these factors is the continued softness in the residential real estate market in many regions of the united states  which makes it more difficult for borrowers in distress to sell their homes  along with tighter credit requirements for new loan products 
the volume of delinquencies and defaults over the past few years has been at historically high levels and has created additional demand for default processing services and has served as a growth catalyst for the mortgage default processing market 
see  however  item a risk factors for a discussion of increased regulations and voluntary foreclosure relief programs that could have an adverse impact on the mortgage default processing market 
based on information provided to the mortgage bankers association  or mba  by banks and loan servicers who report their mortgage data to the mba  million residential mortgage loans were being serviced in the united states as of december   compared to million residential mortgage loans being serviced a year earlier 
the mba is a national association representing the real estate finance industry 
the mba s information also shows that  at december   there were million seriously delinquent mortgages  defined as loans that are more than days past due  compared to million a year ago 
in its fourth quarter industry report  the mba estimates that of all mortgage loans were in foreclosure at december   which is consistent with last year 
this estimate includes loans where servicing has been suspended in accordance with the mortgage lender s or loan servicer s foreclosure requirements and excludes loans where the foreclosure has been completed 
based on this estimated annual volume of mortgages in foreclosure and the average revenue we derived per file in which we assume would be generally representative of rates charged for mortgage default processing services throughout the united states  we believe the us market for non legal residential mortgage default processing services was approximately billion in litigation support services the market for litigation support services is highly fragmented and we believe that it includes a large number of providers across the country  along with an unknown number of law firms in the united states who choose to provide these services to their clients directly rather than outsourcing them 
one of the litigation support services we provide is discovery management and document review services 
discovery is the process by which parties use the legal system to obtain relevant information  primarily in litigation  regulatory  and governmental investigation matters 
some united states companies with in house legal departments choose to perform or manage some portions of the discovery process in house  rather than outsourcing them 
this process can be expensive and time consuming for companies and their lawyers depending upon the volume of emails  electronic files and paper documents a company must review to respond to a document request 
as the volume of data requiring review continues to increase  we anticipate that companies and their lawyers will be required to find more cost effective and efficient solutions to managing their discovery process 
we believe the us market for discovery services was in excess of billion in we also provide appellate services to lawyers in connection with both state and federal appeals 
we currently perform more state appellate work  as state appellate case volume generally is larger than federal case volume 
there are typically about  state appeals filed each year  compared to approximately  federal appeals filed per year  according to information available to us from the administrative office of the us courts and the national center for state courts 
while certain states  such as new york  have very specific appellate filing requirements  federal appeals typically are more complicated and have more challenging document and filing requirements 
our clients typically require counsel press expertise more when their cases are more complicated and the filing requirements are more challenging 
business information we provide business information products to companies and professionals in the legal  financial  real estate and governmental affairs sectors primarily through print and online business journals and court and commercial newspapers  as well as other electronic media offerings 
our business journals generally rely on display and classified advertising as a significant source of revenue and provide content that is relevant to the business communities they target 
our court and commercial newspapers generally rely on public notices as their primary source of revenue and offer extensive and more focused information to the legal communities they target 
all of our business journals and court and commercial newspapers also generate circulation revenue to supplement their advertising and public notice revenue base 
we believe  based on data we have collected over several years  that there are more than local business journals and more than court and commercial newspapers nationwide  which generated approximately billion in revenues in mainstream media outlets  such as television  radio  metropolitan and national newspapers and the internet  generally provide broad based information to a geographically dispersed or demographically diverse audience 
by contrast  we provide proprietary content that is tailored to the legal  financial and real estate sectors of each local and regional market we serve and that is not readily obtainable elsewhere 
our business information products are often the only source of local information for our targeted business communities and compete only to a limited extent for advertising customers with other media outlets  such as television  radio  metropolitan and national newspapers  the internet  outdoor advertising  directories and direct mail 
we are qualified to carry public notices in of the markets we serve 
a public notice is a legally required announcement informing citizens about government or government related activities that may affect citizens everyday lives 
most of these activities involve the application of governmental authority to a private event  such as a mortgage foreclosure  probate filing  listings for fictitious business names  limited liability companies and other entity notices  unclaimed property notices  notices of governmental hearings and trustee sale notices 
every jurisdiction in the united states has laws that regulate the manner in which public notices are published 
statutes specify wording  frequency of publication and other unusual characteristics that may vary according to jurisdiction and make the publication of public notices more complex than traditional advertising 
these laws are designed to ensure that the public receives important information about the actions of its government from a newspaper that is accessible and already a trusted source of community information 
currently  local newspapers generally are the medium that is used to satisfy laws regulating the process of notifying the public 
the requirements for publishing public notices serve as barriers to entry to new and existing publications that desire to carry public notices 
through new subscription based offerings in as a result of acquisitions  federal news and datastream bring us into new industries with their transcription services and customized access to state and federal legislative and regulatory data 
the market for these products and services includes government agencies  including the us congress  news media and other business information providers  and governmental relations professionals in lobbying firms and fortune level companies throughout the us our products and services professional services mortgage default processing services segment we offer mortgage default processing and related services through our majority owned subsidiary  ndex  to our eight law firm customers and  on california and nevada foreclosure files  to mortgage lenders and loan servicers 
we currently own of the membership interests in ndex 
generally  ndex assists its law firm and other customers in processing foreclosure  bankruptcy  eviction and  to a lesser extent  litigation and other mortgage default related case files  in connection with residential mortgage defaults in california  florida  georgia  indiana  michigan  minnesota  nevada and texas 
ndex also provides real estate title services to the barrett law firm and provides loan modification and loss mitigation support on mortgage default files to its customers 
our largest customer is the barrett law firm  which represented approximately of our mortgage default processing services segment revenues and of our total revenues in trott trott is our second largest customer  representing of our mortgage default processing services segment revenues and of our total revenues in in  the top clients of our law firm customers accounted for of the mortgage default case files handled by our law firm customers 
in  we received approximately  mortgage default case files for processing from our customers 
pursuant to to year services agreements  ndex is the sole provider of processing services for foreclosure  bankruptcy  eviction and  to a lesser extent  litigation  for residential mortgage defaults to its eight law firm customers 
these contracts provide for the exclusive referral to ndex of processing work related to residential mortgage default case files handled by each law firm  although trott trott and the barrett law firm may send files elsewhere if directed by their respective clients 
all of ndex s customers pay a fixed fee per file based on the type of file that ndex services 
the initial term of our services agreements with the trott trott and the barrett law firm expire in and  respectively 
the initial term of our services agreements with other law firm customers expire between and in each case  the initial terms of these services agreements will automatically renew for up to two successive five to ten year periods unless either party elects to terminate the term then in effect with prior notice 
during the term of our services agreement with our law firm customer in indiana  we have agreed not to provide mortgage default processing services with respect to real estate located in indiana for any other law firm 
similarly  we have agreed with our law firm customer in minnesota not to provide our services to any other law firm with respect to minnesota real estate during the term of our services agreement 
we also agreed with the albertelli law firm  our florida law firm customer  that we will not provide our services with respect to real estate located in florida for any other law firm until october for the years ended december   and  our mortgage default processing services segment accounted for   and of our total revenues and  and of our professional services division s total revenues  respectively 
mortgage default processing is a volume driven business in which clients of our law firm customers  and our mortgage lender and loan servicer customers for residential real estate located in california and nevada  insist on the efficient and accurate servicing of cases  strict compliance with applicable laws  including loss mitigation efforts  and high levels of customer service 
our law firm customers depend upon our mortgage default processing services because efficient and high quality services translate into the opportunity for more case referrals from their clients 
the default processing begins when a borrower defaults on mortgage payment obligations and the mortgage lender or servicer sends the case file containing the relevant information regarding the loan to our law firm customer  or directly to ndex  with respect to residential real estate located in california and nevada 
our law firm customers are retained by mortgage lending and mortgage servicing firms to provide counsel with respect to the foreclosure  eviction  bankruptcy and  to a lesser extent  litigation and other mortgage default related case files in each of the states in which we provide these services for residential mortgage defaults 
after a file is referred by the mortgage lending or mortgage loan servicing firm to our law firm customers  or directly to us in california and nevada  the lender s or the servicer s goal is to proceed with the foreclosure and disposition of the subject property as efficiently as possible and to make all reasonable attempts to avoid foreclosure and thereby mitigate losses 
immediately after our customer receives a file  it begins to use ndex to process the file 
the procedures surrounding the foreclosure process involve numerous steps  each of which must adhere to strict statutory guidelines and all of which are overseen and directed by attorneys at our law firm customers 
ndex assists these customers with processing residential mortgage defaults  including data entry  supervised document preparation  mailing of required notices and placements of required publications and other non legal processes 
specific procedural steps in the foreclosure process vary by state 
an early step in the process is a letter that must be sent from the law firm  or directly from ndex in the case of properties located in california or nevada  to the borrower as required by the federal fair debt collections practices act 
ndex also assists its customers in opening a file and ordering a title search on the mortgaged property to determine if there are any liens or encumbrances 
the data received from the lender or mortgage servicing client of the law firm customers  and the results of the title search or commitment search  become the foundation of the foreclosure case file that ndex assists its customers in building 
we service customers in both non judicial and judicial foreclosure states 
in a judicial foreclosure state  a loan is secured by a mortgage and the foreclosing party must file a complaint and summons that begin a lawsuit requesting that the court order a foreclosure 
the law firm and ndex must also arrange for service to defendants of the complaint and summons 
if successful  the plaintiff in a judicial foreclosure state obtains a judgment that leads to a subsequent foreclosure sale 
in connection with such foreclosure  a public notice must be published the requisite number of times in a qualified local newspaper 
in a non judicial state  a loan is secured by a mortgage that contains a power of sale clause  and the lender may begin the foreclosure process without a court order 
generally  foreclosing parties in non judicial states must publish a public notice to commence the foreclosure process 
once the public notice has been published the requisite number of times in a qualified local newspaper  ndex arranges  under the direction of the law firm or  in california and nevada  its mortgage lender and loan servicer customers  for a copy to be posted on the front door of the subject property  if required by applicable law  and for a digital photo to be obtained to prove compliance 
after publication has been completed and all other legal steps have been taken  the sheriff s deed and affidavits are prepared for review by the law firm prior to the public auction 
in all cases  except texas where publication is not required  a sworn affidavit of publication of the required public notice must be obtained from the newspaper publisher by the law firm using ndex s staff and entered into the case file along with proof of publication 
if the process goes all the way to a foreclosure auction of the subject property  ndex works with its customers and the sheriff to coordinate the auction and to facilitate communications among interested parties 
in michigan  as an example  the foreclosing party may enter a bid in the amount of its total indebtedness for the subject property 
a decision regarding whether the foreclosing party should bid  and how much  is determined by attorneys at the law firm pursuant to instructions received from the lender or mortgage servicer 
after the auction  the sale results are communicated by ndex to interested parties and the appropriate deeds are recorded 
the eight states in which we do business permit the former owner to recover the property at any time prior to its sale by the sheriff by paying the default amount  plus interest and costs 
in addition  michigan and minnesota each have six month redemption periods following the auction  during which time the former owners can pay the amount bid  plus accumulated interest  and thereby recover the property 
if the redemption payment is made in full  funds are forwarded to the lender and all parties are notified by ndex that a redemption has occurred 
in that event  the sheriff s deed is void 
if  however  no redemption occurs after the statutory redemption period has passed  the law firm works with its clients to determine the next step 
at this point in time  if the property is still occupied  documents are prepared by the law firm and generated by ndex to commence an eviction 
at any point during this process  a borrower may file for bankruptcy  which results in a stay on mortgage default proceedings 
therefore  ndex assists its customers in frequently and diligently checking bankruptcy court records to ensure that a bankruptcy filing has not been made 
most foreclosure cases do not proceed all the way to eviction  but are ended at earlier dates by property redemption  property sale  bankruptcy  or by a vacancy by the mortgagor 
fees 
government sponsored entities  including fannie mae and freddie mac  monitor and establish guidelines that are generally accepted by mortgage lending and mortgage servicing firms nationwide for the per file case fees to be paid to their counsel 
thus  our law firm customers receive a fixed fee per file from their clients and we then receive our agreed upon fixed fee per file from the applicable law firm 
under the services agreements with our law firm customers  we are entitled to receive a fee when our law firm customer directs us to begin processing a residential mortgage case file  regardless of whether the case proceeds all the way to foreclosure  eviction  bankruptcy or litigation 
if our customers client proceeds to eviction or chooses to litigate  or if the borrower files for bankruptcy  and in some instances when the time to process the file is prolonged  we receive additional fixed fees per case file 
in california and nevada  foreclosures may be undertaken by non attorneys 
thus  in the case of california and nevada foreclosure files  we receive the full fee directly from our customers  the mortgage lender or loan servicers 
technology 
ndex has two proprietary case management software systems that store  manage and report on the large amount of data associated with each foreclosure  bankruptcy  eviction or litigation case file serviced by ndex in each of the states in which we do business 
one was developed by ndex for use in michigan  the other was developed by barrett ndex which we acquired in september for use in texas  georgia  california and nevada 
under both systems  each case file is scanned  stored and tracked digitally  thereby improving record keeping 
the systems also provide ndex s management with real time information regarding employee productivity and the status of case files 
we are constantly working to improve the functionality of our proprietary case management systems and other related it productivity tools to meet the needs of our customers mortgage lender and loan servicer clients 
for example  we have developed the ability to provide our customers clients email notifications of case status and customized case and summary reports 
we have successfully customized the system used in michigan to efficiently and productively process files of our law firm customers in minnesota and indiana and plan to do the same for our florida law firm customer  the albertelli law firm  in early ndex continues to use the system developed by barrett ndex to service our customers in texas  california  nevada and georgia 
in  we intend to implement barrett ndex on the case management system originally developed for use in michigan  so that we are using the same system in all of the states where we do business

advertising 
all of our print products  as well as a large number of our electronic products  carry commercial advertising  which consists of display and classified advertising 
for the years ended december   and  advertising including revenues from events discussed under seminars  programs and other events below accounted for  and of our total revenues and  and of our business information division s total revenues  respectively 
we generate our advertising revenues from a variety of local business and individual customers in the legal  financial and real estate sectors that we serve 
for example  our top advertising customers only represented  in the aggregate  of our total business information revenues in additionally  for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our advertising revenues from local advertisers and about of our advertising revenues from national advertisers ie  advertisers that place advertising in several of our publications at one time 
because spending by local advertisers is generally less volatile than that of national advertisers  we believe that our advertising revenue streams carry a greater level of stability than publications that carry primarily national advertising and therefore we are better positioned to withstand broad downturns in advertising spending 
public notices 
public notices are legal notices required by federal  state or local law to be published in qualified publications 
a publication must typically satisfy several legal requirements in order to provide public notices 
in general  a publication must possess a difficult to obtain us postal service periodical permit  be of general and paid circulation within the relevant jurisdiction  include news content  and have been established and regularly and uninterruptedly published for one to five years immediately preceding the first publication of a public notice 
some jurisdictions also require that a public notice business be adjudicated by a governmental body 
we are qualified to carry public notices in of the markets in which we publish business journals or court and commercial newspapers 
our court and commercial newspapers publish different types of public notices  including foreclosure notices  probate notices  notices of fictitious business names  limited liability company and other entity notices  trustee sale notices  unclaimed property notices  notices of governmental hearings  notices of elections  bond issuances  zoning matters  bid solicitations and awards and governmental budgets 
for the years ended december   and  public notices accounted for  and of our total revenues and  and of our business information division s total revenues  respectively 
we believe that over of our public notice customers in also published public notices in our primary public notice customers include real estate related businesses and trustees  governmental agencies  attorneys and businesses or individuals filing fictitious business name statements 
subscription based revenues and other 
we sell our business information products primarily through subscriptions to our publications  web sites and email notification systems  legislative databases  and transcription services 
we also provide commercial printing services and sell database information through royalty or licensing fee arrangements 
for the years ended december   and  our subscription based and other revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues and  and of our business information division s total revenues  respectively 
subscription renewal rates for our business information products were in the aggregate in  up from in our renewal rates reflect that our products are relied upon as sources of necessary information by the business communities in the markets we serve 
seminars  programs and other events

see recent developments new investments below for a description of recent investments 
competition professional services division mortgage default processing services some mortgage loan lenders and servicers have in house mortgage default processing service departments  while others outsource this function to law firms that offer internal mortgage default processing services or have relationships with third party providers of mortgage default processing services 
we estimate that the outsourced mortgage default processing services market primarily consists of the back office operations of approximately local and regional law firms 
mortgage lending and mortgage loan servicing firms demand high service levels from their counsel and the providers of mortgage default processing services  with their primary concerns being the efficiency and accuracy by which counsel and the provider of processing services can complete the file and the precision with which loss mitigation efforts are pursued 
accordingly  mortgage default processing service firms compete on the basis of efficiency by which they can process files and the quality of their mortgage default processing services 
we believe that increasing case volumes and rising client expectations provide us an opportunity due to our ability to leverage our proprietary case management systems to provide efficient and effective services on a timely basis 
professional services division litigation support services the market for litigation support services is highly fragmented and we believe that it includes a large number of document review companies and appellate service providers across the country as well as an unknown number of law firms who provide these services directly for their clients 
we also believe that many united states companies that would benefit from our litigation support services have in house legal departments that provide and manage a number of our services for the company 
we compete with a large number of service providers in this segment and believe that document review and discovery management service providers like discoverready include consulting practices of a number of major accounting firms and general management consulting firms 
we believe that most appellate service providers like counsel press are general printing service companies that do not have the resources or experience to assist counsel with large or complex appeals or to prepare electronic filings  including hyperlinked digital briefs  that are being required by an increasing number of appellate courts 
this presents us with an opportunity to compete on the basis of the quality and array of services we offer  as opposed to the price of such services 
we believe that  in addition to price pressure  the other principal competitive factors in this segment are our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals  our relationships with customers  our reputation and the ability to provide high quality services while still managing engagements effectively 
business information division our business information division s customers focus on the quantity and quality of necessary information  the quantity and type of advertising  timely delivery and  to a lesser extent  price 
we benefit from well established customer relationships in each of the target markets we serve 
we have developed these strong customer relationships over an extended period of time by providing timely  relevant and dependable business information products that have created a solid foundation of customer loyalty and a recognized brand in each market we serve 
our segment of the media industry is characterized by high barriers to entry  both economic and social 
the local and regional communities we serve generally can sustain only one publication as specialized as ours 
moreover  the brand value associated with long term reader and advertiser loyalty  and the high start up costs associated with developing and distributing content and selling advertisements  help to limit competition 
subscription renewal rates for local business journals and court and commercial periodicals are generally high 
accordingly  it is often difficult for a new business information provider to enter a market and establish a significant subscriber base for its content 
we compete for display and classified advertising and circulation with at least one metropolitan daily newspaper and one local business journal in many of the markets we serve 
generally  we compete for these forms of advertising on the basis of how efficiently we can reach an advertiser s target audience and the quality and tailored nature of our proprietary content 
we compete for public notices with usually one metropolitan daily newspaper in the markets in which we are qualified to publish public notices 
we compete for public notices based on our expertise  focus  customer service and competitive pricing 
our new legislative and political information businesses  datastream and federal news  are based chiefly on a subscription model  and by providing highly targeted or uniquely customized information  both have developed long term and close customer relationships 
datastream s management and conversion of data for government clients  including the us house of representatives and the library of congress  has allowed datastream to develop proprietary systems for efficiently capturing and enhancing complex feeds of government data which  in turn  are relied upon by the leading business and legislative information service providers and aggregators in washington dc we believe these relationships with both government information sources and the distributors of government information create a high barrier to entry  with our main competitors being large information and data service providers 
federal news  which similarly provides transcription services to information aggregators in addition to news media  government relations professionals  government agencies and foreign embassies  does face direct competition from a unit of a washington dc based legislative and political information service 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as license agreements and confidentiality agreements and practices  to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we currently own one patent and have recently filed additional patent applications seeking to protect certain of our newest innovations 
we own a number of registered and unregistered trademarks for use in connection with our business  including trademarks in the mastheads of all but one of our print products  and trade names  including ndex  counsel press and discoverready 
if trademarks remain in continuous use in connection with similar goods or services  their term can be perpetual  subject  with respect to registered trademarks  to the timely renewal of their registrations with the united states patent and trademark office 
we have a perpetual  royalty free license for new orleans citybusiness  which  except for our military newspapers  is the only one of our print titles for which we do not own a registered or unregistered trademark 
we approach copyright ownership with respect to our publications in the same manner as is customary in the publishing industry 
consequently  we own the copyright in all of our newspapers  journals and newsletters  as compilations  and also own the copyright in almost all of our other print products 
with respect to the specific articles in our publications  with the exception of certain of our military newspapers  we own all rights  title and interest in original materials created by our full time journalists  designers  photographers and editors 
for outside contributors  we generally obtain either all rights  title and interest in the work or the exclusive first time publication and non exclusive republication rights with respect to publication in our print and electronic business information products 
we license the content of certain of our products to several third party information aggregators on a non exclusive basis for republication and dissemination on electronic databases marketed by the licensees 
these licenses all had an original term of two years or more and remain subject to renewal 
we also license dolan media newswires to various third party publications 
we have copyright and trade secret rights in our proprietary case management software systems  document conversion system and other software products and information systems 
in addition  we have extensive subscriber and other customer databases that we believe would be extremely difficult to replicate 
we attempt to protect our software  systems and databases as trade secrets by restricting access to them and by using confidentiality agreements 
we currently have one patent and one pending patent application on an ndex related bankruptcy claim tracking system  and we have four patent applications pending on recent discoverready and datastream innovations 
despite the various means we have taken to protect our intellectual and proprietary rights  it is possible that others may obtain information we regard as confidential or that others will independently develop similar software  databases or customer lists 
in addition to the proprietary rights we have and the means we have taken to protect them  we believe our continued success also depends on our name recognition  product enhancements and new product developments  and the knowledge  skill and expertise of our personnel 
employees as of december   we employed  persons  of whom  were employed by ndex in our mortgage default processing services segment  were employed in our litigation support services segment  were employed in our business information division which is also a segment and of whom served in executive or administrative capacities 
three unions represent an aggregate of employees  or approximately and of our employees  at our minneapolis and baltimore printing facilities in our business information division  respectively 
we believe we have a good relationship with our employees

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements  before investing in shares of our common stock 
as indicated earlier in this annual report on form k under the title cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  certain information contained in this annual report are forward looking statements 
if any of the following events actually occur or risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected and could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our business in general we may have difficulty managing our growth  which may result in operating inefficiencies and negatively impact our operating margins 
our growth may place a significant strain on our management and operations  especially as we continue to expand our product and service offerings  the number of markets we serve and the number of local offices we maintain throughout the united states  including through acquiring new businesses 
we may not be able to manage our growth on a timely or cost effective basis or accurately predict the timing or rate of this growth 
we believe that our current and anticipated growth will require us to continue implementing new and enhanced systems  expanding and upgrading our data processing software and training our personnel to utilize these systems and software 
our growth has also required  and will continue to require  that we increase our investment in management personnel  financial and management systems and controls and office facilities 
in particular  we are  and will continue to be  highly dependent on the effective and reliable operation of our centralized accounting  circulation and information systems 
in addition  the scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations has changed as the size and complexity of our business has changed 
if we fail to manage these and other growth requirements successfully or if we are unable to implement or maintain our centralized systems  or rely on their output  we may experience operating inefficiencies or not achieve anticipated efficiencies 
in addition  the increased costs associated with our expected growth may not be offset by corresponding increases in our revenues  which would decrease our operating margins 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities  which we may not do successfully and may subject us to considerable business and financial risks 
we have grown  and anticipate that we will continue to grow  through opportunistic acquisitions of professional services and business information businesses 
while we evaluate potential acquisitions on an ongoing basis  we may not be successful in assessing the value  strengths and weaknesses of acquisition opportunities or consummating acquisitions on acceptable terms 
for example  to the extent that market studies performed by third parties are not accurate indicators of market and business trends  we may not appropriately evaluate or realize the future market growth or business opportunities in targeted geographic areas and business lines that we expect from an acquisition 
furthermore  we may not be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities and suitable acquisition opportunities may not even be made available or known to us 
in addition  we may compete for certain acquisition targets with companies that have greater financial resources than we do 
our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities may also be limited by non competition provisions to which we are subject 
for example  our ability to carry public notices in michigan and to provide mortgage default processing services in florida  indiana and minnesota is limited by contractual non competition provisions 
we anticipate financing future acquisitions through cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facility and or other debt or equity financing  including takedowns on our million shelf registration statement  which the sec declared effective on january  all of these could reduce our cash available for other purposes or  in the case of a common stock or other equity offering under our shelf registration statement  substantially dilute your investment in us 
for example  we were required to incur additional indebtedness to close the acquisitions of barrett ndex and discoverready and this additional debt consumed a significant portion of our ability to borrow and may limit our ability to pursue other acquisitions or growth strategies 
we may incur significant expenses while pursuing acquisitions  which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in  we expensed an aggregate of approximately million of acquisition costs 
acquisitions that we complete may expose us to particular business and financial risks that include  but are not limited to diverting management s time  attention and resources from managing our business  incurring additional indebtedness and assuming liabilities  incurring significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses to improve  coordinate or integrate managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  experiencing an adverse impact on our earnings from non recurring acquisition related charges or the write off or amortization of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  facing operational difficulties in new markets or with new product or service offerings  and failing to retain key personnel and customers of the acquired businesses  including subscribers and advertisers for acquired publications  clients of the law firm customers served by acquired mortgage default processing and other customers served by acquired mortgage default processing and litigation support services businesses 
we may not be able to successfully manage acquired businesses or increase our cash flow from these operations 
if we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions  or if we encounter unforeseen expenses  difficulties  complications or delays frequently encountered in connection with the integration of acquired entities and the expansion of operations  our growth and ability to compete may be impaired  we may fail to achieve acquisition synergies and we may be required to focus resources on integration of operations rather than other profitable areas 
we depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate and grow our business effectively if we lose the services of any of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified personnel in the future 
we rely heavily on our senior management team  including james p 
dolan  our founder  chairman  chief executive officer and president  scott j 
pollei  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  david a 
trott  chairman and chief executive officer of ndex  mark wc stodder  our executive vice president business information  and vicki j 
duncomb  our vice president and chief financial officer  because they have a unique understanding of our diverse product and service offerings and the ability to manage an organization that has a diverse group of employees 
our ability to retain messrs 
dolan  pollei  trott and stodder and ms 
duncomb and other key personnel is therefore very important to our future success 
in addition  we rely on our senior management  especially mr 
dolan  to identify growth opportunities through the development or acquisition of additional publications and professional services opportunities  such as our acquisition of discoverready in november and barrett ndex in september we have employment agreements with messrs 
dolan  pollei  trott and stodder and ms 
duncomb 
these employment agreements  however  do not ensure that messrs 
dolan  pollei  trott and stodder and ms 
duncomb will not voluntarily terminate their employment with us 
further  we do not typically enter into employment agreements with other key personnel 
in addition  our key personnel are subject to non competition restrictions  which generally restrict such employees from working for competing businesses for a period of one year after the end of their employment with us 
these non compete provisions  however may not be enforceable 
we also do not have key man insurance for any of our current management or other key personnel 
the loss of any key personnel would require the remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement 
competition for senior management personnel is intense 
an inability to find a suitable replacement for any departing executive officer or key employee on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business 
we are subject to risks relating to litigation due to the nature of our product and service offerings 
we may  from time to time  be subject to or named as a party in libel actions  negligence claims  contract claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business given the editorial content of our business information products and the technical rules with which our litigation support services and mortgage default processing businesses must comply and the strict deadlines these businesses must meet 
we could incur significant legal expenses and our management s attention may be diverted from our operations in defending ourselves against and resolving lawsuits or claims 
an adverse resolution of any future lawsuits or claims against us could result in a negative perception of us and cause the market price of our common stock to decline or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating results and growth prospects 
we rely on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws  and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  patents  domain names and agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we rely on service mark and trademark protection in the united states to protect our rights to our key marks and distinctive logos 
these measures may not be adequate  we may not have secured  or may not be able to secure  appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the united states  or third parties may infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect these rights  unauthorized third parties may attempt to use our trademarks  confidential information  inventions and other proprietary rights for their similar uses 
our management s attention may be diverted by these attempts and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation 
we may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property  and we may not prevail in these disputes 
third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the trademarks  copyright or other proprietary rights of that third party 
some third party proprietary rights may be extremely broad  and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights 
any such claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit 
our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all  and we may be required to alter the content of our classes or pay monetary damages  which may be significant 
we rely on our proprietary case management software systems  document conversion and review systems  web sites and online networks  and a disruption  failure or security compromise of these systems may disrupt our business  damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our proprietary case management software systems are critical to our mortgage default processing service business because they enable us to efficiently and timely service a large number of foreclosure  bankruptcy  eviction and  to a lesser extent  litigation and other mortgage default related case files 
our litigation support services businesses rely upon our proprietary document conversion and review systems that facilitate our efficient processing of appellate briefs  records and appendices and document reviews 
similarly  we rely on our web sites and email notification systems to provide timely  relevant and dependable business information to our customers 
therefore  network or system shutdowns caused by events such as computer hacking  dissemination of computer viruses  worms and other destructive or disruptive software  denial of service attacks and other malicious activity  as well as power outages  natural disasters and similar events  could have an adverse impact on our operations  customer satisfaction and revenues due to degradation of service  service disruption or damage to equipment and data 
in addition to shutdowns  our systems are subject to risks caused by misappropriation  misuse  leakage  falsification and accidental release or loss of information  including sensitive case file data maintained in our proprietary case management systems and credit card information for our business information customers 
as a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information  the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection and security of personal information  information related risks are increasing  particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal data 
disruptions or security compromises of our systems could result in large expenditures to repair or replace such systems  remedy any security breaches and protect us from similar events in the future 
we also could be exposed to negligence claims or other legal proceedings brought by our customers or their clients  and we could incur significant legal expenses and our management s attention may be diverted from our operations in defending ourselves against and resolving lawsuits or claims 
in addition  if we were to suffer damage to our reputation as a result of any system failure or security compromise  ndex s customers and or their clients could choose to send fewer foreclosure  bankruptcy or eviction case files to us and or our law firm customers 
any reduction in the number of case files handled by our customers would also reduce the number of mortgage default case files handled by us 
similarly  our litigation support services clients may elect to use other service providers 
in addition  customers of our business information division may seek out alternative sources of the business information available on our web sites and email notification systems 
further  in the event that any disruption or security compromise constituted a material breach under our services agreements  our law firm customers could terminate these agreements 
in any of these cases  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or raise additional capital to fund our operations and acquisitions  repay our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures and this additional cash may not be available to us on satisfactory timing or terms or at all 
our ability to generate cash depends to some extent on general economic  financial  legislative and regulatory conditions in the markets which we serve and as they relate to the industries in which we do business and other factors outside of our control 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from foreclosures approximately of our total revenues in 
therefore  legislation  loss mitigation  moratoria  loan modifications and other efforts that significantly mitigate and or delay foreclosures may adversely impact our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund day to day operations in our mortgage default processing services segment and professional services division  and  to a lesser extent  our business information division  to repay our indebtedness  when due  to fund capital expenditures  to meet our cash flow needs and to pursue any material expansion of our business  including through acquisitions or increased capital spending 
we may  therefore  need to incur additional indebtedness or raise funds from the sale of additional equity 
financing  however  may not be available to us at all  at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms  when needed 
our existing bank credit facility may also limit our ability to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing 
in addition  if we issue a significant amount of additional equity securities  the market price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interests in us 
if our indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill or finite life intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
in the course of our operating history  we have acquired numerous assets and businesses 
some of our acquisitions have resulted in the recording of a significant amount of indefinite lived and finite life intangible assets on our financial statements 
at december   our indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill were million  in the aggregate  and our finite life intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million 
if we acquire new assets or businesses in the future  as we intend to do  we may record additional goodwill or other intangible assets 
we assess our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis using a measurement date of november and  based on this assessment  we have determined that our goodwill is not impaired 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates intangible assets and other long lived assets later in this report for information for our annual test of goodwill impairment 
accounting standards require that we also assess the impairment of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets whenever events  circumstances or other conditions indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset 
this may require us to conduct an interim assessment of our goodwill and finite life intangible assets 
as a result of this interim assessment  we may record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets is determined 
this charge  if taken  could adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations  and future earnings and  as a result  could cause our stock price to decline 
our failure to comply with the covenants contained on our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business as planned 
we have  and will continue to have  significant debt and debt service obligations 
our credit agreement contains  and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain  financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  including to finance future operations or other capital needs  and to engage in other activities that we may believe are in our long term best interests  including to dispose of or acquire assets 
our failure to comply with these covenants may result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could result in the banks accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness or preventing us from accessing availability under our credit facility 
if the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and we may not be able to continue our operations as planned 
in addition  the indebtedness under our credit agreement is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets  including the equity interests of our subsidiaries  and therefore  if we are unable to repay such indebtedness the banks could foreclose on these assets and sell the pledged equity interests  which would adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock depends on a variety of factors  which could cause our common stock to trade at prices below the price you have paid 
our common stock has traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol dm since august  since that time  the closing sales price of our common stock has ranged from a high of to a low of per share 
the market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could affect our share price include  but are not limited to variations in our quarterly or annual operating results  changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting our business  changes in our earnings estimates or expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock  additions or departures of key management personnel  any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future  announcements by us or others and developments affecting us  actions by institutional stockholders  changes in market valuations of similar companies  speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general  future offerings of debt or equity  future offerings of our common stock in the public market  and general economic  market and political conditions 
these factors could cause our common stock to trade at prices below the price you paid for our common stock  which could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above this price 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the new york stock exchange in particular  has from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of individual securities 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
if similar litigation were instituted against us  it could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our operations 
anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated by laws and stockholder rights plan may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws and stockholder rights plan could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock and your rights as a holder of our common stock 
for example  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with rights and preferences designated by our board  stagger the terms of our board of directors into three classes and impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholders meetings 
in addition  our stockholder rights plan  which our board adopted on january   and which was amended on may   entitles the holders of rights  when exercisable  to acquire  in exchange for the exercise price of each right  shares of our common stock  having a value equal to two times the exercise price of each right 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder and which may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
in addition  our bank credit facility contains provisions that could limit our ability to enter into change of control transactions 
risks relating to our professional services division if the number of case files referred to us by our mortgage default processing service law firm customers  or loan servicers and mortgage lenders we serve directly for mortgage default files in california and nevada  decreases or fails to increase  our operating results and ability to execute our growth strategy could be adversely affected 
ndex has eight law firm customers and also provides mortgage default professing services directly to lenders and loan servicers for residential real estate located in california and nevada 
revenues from ndex constituted and of our professional services division s revenues in and  respectively  and and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
we are paid different fixed fees for each foreclosure  bankruptcy  eviction  litigation  and other mortgage default related case file referred by these eight law firms to us for processing services 
therefore  the success of ndex and our mortgage default processing services segment is tied to the number of these case files that each of our law firm customers receives from their mortgage lending and mortgage loan servicing firm clients and the number of california and nevada foreclosure files we receive directly from our mortgage lender and loan servicer customers 
in  our largest law firm customer was the barrett law firm  who represented of our mortgage default processing services revenues 
trott trott was our second largest law firm customer in and accounted for of these revenues 
also  in  the top ten clients for all of our law firm customers  on an aggregated basis  accounted for of the case files our law firm customers directed to us for mortgage default processing services 
our operating results and ability to execute our growth strategy could be adversely affected if any of our law firm customers lose business from these clients  these clients are affected by changes in the market and industry  or other factors that cause them to be unable to pay for the services of our law firm customer or reduce the volume of files referred to our law firm customers and which they direct us to process  or our law firm customers are unable to attract additional business from current or new clients for any reason  including any of the following the provision of poor legal services  the loss of key attorneys such as david a 
trott  who has developed and maintains a substantial amount of trott trott s client relationships  the desire of the law firm s clients to allocate files among several law firms or a decrease in the number of residential mortgage foreclosures in the eight states where we do business  including due to market factors or governmental action 
a failure by one or more of our law firm customers to pay us as a result of these factors could materially reduce the cash flow of ndex and result in losses in our mortgage default processing services segment 
further  to the extent that trott trott s or the barrett law firm s clients direct either of them to use another provider of mortgage default processing services or those clients conduct such services in house  the number of files we process would be adversely affected 
we could also lose any law firm customer if we materially breach our services agreements with such customer 
bills introduced and laws enacted to mitigate foreclosures  voluntary relief programs and voluntary halts or moratoria by servicers or lenders  as well as governmental investigations  litigation and court orders  may have an adverse affect  and at times have had an adverse effect  on our mortgage default processing services and public notice operations 
the increasing number of mortgage defaults  foreclosures and evictions have resulted  and may continue to result in new or increased government regulation either legislatively or through courts of residential mortgage products or the foreclosure of delinquent loans 
if new or more stringent regulations are enacted  our customers and or their clients would likely be subject to these regulations 
as a result  these new or more stringent regulations may adversely impact the number of mortgage default files that our law firm customers receive from their clients and can then direct us to process or that we receive for processing from our california and nevada mortgage lender and loan servicer customers 
federal  state and local governmental entities and leaders have increasingly focused attention on foreclosures and have proposed  and in some cases  enacted legislation or taken other action that may have  and some of which has had  an adverse impact on the number of mortgage default case files ndex is asked to process  the length of time it takes to process such files  the time over which we recognize revenue associated with the processing of those files  and the number of foreclosure public notices placed in our business information products and dlnp our minority investment for publication 
this legislation includes the hope for homeowners act of  the emergency economic stabilization act  the streamlined modification program  and the homeowner affordability and stability plan including the making home affordable program  the home affordable modification program hamp  and the home affordable foreclosure alternatives program hafa  the protecting tenants at foreclosure act  and laws passed to mitigate foreclosures in california  maryland  michigan  indiana  and florida 
there also have been voluntary foreclosure relief programs developed by lenders  loan servicers and the hope new alliance a consortium that includes loan servicers 
the past year included additional legislation aimed at mitigating foreclosures  additional scrutiny on mortgage foreclosures  and voluntary stoppages of foreclosures by servicers and lenders 
mortgage foreclosures received additional scrutiny due to widespread national media coverage of reported procedural and documentation error and lapses by other parties in the industry 
the state attorneys general coordinated to review the foreclosure process 
certain servicers reacted to the attention being paid to the foreclosure process by various other government officials and constituencies with self imposed foreclosure sale and eviction moratoria in the fall of while these servicers verified their internal policies and procedures 
certain servicers also reacted to this environment of increased scrutiny in by requesting additional information and process verification from law firms and vendors to which they refer their mortgage foreclosures 
in fall  numerous servicers halted foreclosures in the judicial states  which affected us in indiana and florida 
in february  the department of the treasury submitted a report to congress entitled reforming america s housing finance market which included a plan to responsibly reduce the role of the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac in the mortgage market and expressed a goal of ultimately winding down both institutions 
many of the files we process are supported by fannie mae or freddie mac 
as a result  any change to these institutions  or broader changes to the mortgage market as a whole  may adversely impact the number of mortgage default files received by our law firm customers from their clients and therefore the number directed they direct to us to process and received by us for processing in california and nevada by our mortgage lender and loan servicer customers 
these and other laws  proposed legislation  investigations  directives  voluntary programs  actions  plans  and court orders  have delayed  and may delay or reduce in the future  the referral of files to our law firm customers  or in the case of foreclosures on properties located in california and nevada  the referral of files directly to us for processing 
in addition  they may continue to increase the processing time for the foreclosure files between the referral to the attorney or trustee and the foreclosure sale 
in some instances they may continue to increase the time over which we recognize revenue associated with the processing of such files and may reduce margins 
similarly  new or more stringent regulations and court orders could adversely affect when public notices are sent to our business information products or detroit legal publishing news our minority investment for publication 
if this legislation or any other bills being considered  or court orders or programs are successful in reducing the number of mortgages going into default  then the number of foreclosure public notices referred to us or dlnp for publication will also be reduced 
if any of these occur  it could have a negative impact on our earnings and growth 
david a 
trott  the chairman and chief executive officer of ndex  james frappier  a senior vice president of ndex  and certain other employees of ndex  who are also shareholders and principal attorneys of our law firm customers  may under certain circumstances have interests that differ from or conflict with our interests 
ndex s chairman and chief executive officer  david a 
trott  along with james frappier  a senior vice president of ndex  and other executive vice presidents and senior executives in ndex s operations  are the principal attorneys and shareholders of ndex s eight law firm customers 
in addition  certain members of the senior management at barrett ndex own an interest in ndex and have the right to require that we redeem their interest beginning in september see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations noncontrolling interest later in this report 
as a result of these relationships with ndex and our law firm customers  mr 
trott and these individuals may experience conflicts of interest in the execution of their duties on behalf of us 
these conflicts may not be resolved in a manner favorable to us 
for example  they may be precluded by their ethical obligations as attorneys or may otherwise be reluctant to take actions on behalf of us that are in our best interests  but are not or may not be in the best interests of their law firms or their clients 
further  as licensed attorneys  they may be obligated to take actions on behalf of their law firms or their respective clients that are not in our best interests 
in addition  mr 
trott has other direct and indirect relationships with the detroit legal news publishing  llc and other vendors ndex uses that could cause similar conflicts 
see related party transactions and policies david a 
trott in our proxy statement and note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these relationships 
we have owned and operated discoverready for a very short period of time and we are highly dependent on the skills and knowledge of the individuals serving as chief executive officer and president of discoverready as none of our executive officers have managed or operated a discovery management and document review services company prior to this acquisition 
we acquired an equity interest in discoverready on november   and currently own of these interests 
dr holdco llc owns the remaining membership interest in discoverready 
dr holdco is a limited liability company owned by james k 
wagner  jr 
and steven r 
harber  discoverready s chief executive officer and president  respectively  along with other discoverready employees  discoverready provides outsourced discovery management and document review services to major united states and global companies and their law firms 
prior to our acquisition of this business  our executive officers have not managed or operated a discovery management and document review business 
thus  we rely heavily on the management skills and experiences of messrs 
wagner and harber  who have co founded and built discoverready and have a deep understanding of the discovery management and document review business 
if our executive officers cannot effectively manage and operate this business  the operating results and prospects for discoverready  our litigation support services segment and our professional services division may be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute our growth strategy with respect to discoverready 
we have employment agreements with messrs 
wagner and harber  however  these employment agreements do not ensure that either of them will not voluntarily terminate their employment with us 
we also do not have key man insurance for either of messrs 
wagner or harber 
the loss of either messr 
wagner or harber could require our executive officers to divert immediate attention to seeking a replacement and operating a business in which our executive officers have no prior experience 
our inability to find a suitable replacement for either of messrs 
wagner or harber on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow discoverready 
discoverready s business revenues are very concentrated among a few customers and if these customers choose to manage their discovery with their own staff or with another provider and if we are unable to develop new customer relationships  our operating results and the ability to execute our growth strategy at discoverready may be adversely affected 
discoverready generates revenue through fee based arrangements for outsourced discovery management and document review services with major united states and global companies and their counsel 
discoverready s top two customers both in the financial services industry accounted for  in the aggregate  of its total revenues for in particular  one of these customers accounted for of its revenues and of its revenues 
as a result  the success of discoverready is tied to our relationships with these key customers as well as our ability to develop new customer relationships 
our operating results and ability to execute our growth strategy for discoverready could be adversely affected if we lose business from either of these customers  these customers are affected by changes in the market and industry or other factors that cause them to be unable to pay for our services  or we are unable to attract additional business from current or new customers for any reason  including any of the following poor service  the loss of key employees  such as james k 
wagner  jr 
and steven r 
harber  or the decision of our customers to perform document review services with their own staff or to with another provider 
if any of these were to occur  it could reduce the cash flow of discoverready and adversely affect the results of operations of this business 
regulation of the legal profession may constrain the operations of the businesses in our professional services division  and numerous related issues could impair our ability to provide professional services to our customers and reduce our revenues and profitability 
each state has adopted laws  regulations and codes of ethics that provide for the licensure of attorneys  which grants attorneys the exclusive right to practice law and places restrictions upon the activities of licensed attorneys 
the boundaries of the practice of law  however  are indistinct  vary from one state to another and are the product of complex interactions among state law  bar associations and constitutional law formulated by the us supreme court 
many states define the practice of law to include the giving of advice and opinions regarding another person s legal rights  the preparation of legal documents or the preparation of court documents for another person 
in addition  all states and the american bar association prohibit attorneys from sharing fees for legal services with non attorneys 
pursuant to services agreements between ndex and its law firm customers  we provide mortgage default processing services to law firms and directly to mortgage lenders and loan servicers on california foreclosure files 
through discoverready  we provide outsourced discovery management and document review services 
through counsel press  we provide procedural and technical knowledge to law firms and attorneys to assist them in filing appellate briefs  records and appendices on behalf of their clients that comply with court rules 
current laws  regulations and codes of ethics related to the practice of law pose the following principal risks state or local bar associations  state or local prosecutors or other persons may challenge the services provided by ndex  counsel press or discoverready as constituting the unauthorized practice of law 
any such challenge could have a disruptive effect upon the operations of our business  including the diversion of significant time and attention of our senior management 
we may also incur significant expenses in connection with such a challenge  including substantial fees for attorneys and other professional advisors 
if a challenge to any of these businesses were successful  we may need to materially modify our professional services operations in a manner that could adversely affect that division s revenues and profitability and we could be subject to a range of penalties that could damage our reputation in the legal markets we serve 
in addition  any similar challenge to the operations of ndex s law firm customers could adversely impact their mortgage default business  which would in turn adversely affect our mortgage default processing segment and professional service division s revenues and profitability  the services agreements to which ndex is a party could be deemed to be unenforceable if a court were to determine that such agreements constituted an impermissible fee sharing arrangement between the law firm and ndex  and applicable laws  regulations and codes of ethics  including their interpretation and enforcement  could change in a manner that restricts ndex s  counsel press or discoverready s operations 
any such change in laws  policies or practices could increase our cost of doing business or adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
failure to effectively customize either of our proprietary case management software systems so that they can be used to serve law firm customers in new states could adversely affect our mortgage default processing service business and growth prospects 
we have two proprietary case management software systems  each of which stores  manages and reports on the large amount of data associated with each foreclosure  bankruptcy or eviction case file we process 
one system was initially built for use in michigan and the other for use in texas  both of which are primarily non judicial foreclosure states 
other states  like indiana  are judicial foreclosures states 
as a result  our law firm customers must satisfy different requirements depending on the state in which they serve their clients 
when we enter a service agreement with a law firm customer in a state where we do not currently do business  we need to customize one of our proprietary case management software systems so that it can be used to assist that customer in satisfying the foreclosure requirements of their state 
if we are not  on a timely basis  able to effectively customize one of our case management software systems to serve our new law firm customers  we may not be able to realize the operational efficiencies and increased capacity to handle files that we anticipated when we entered the service agreements 
at times  we base the fees we agree to receive from these law firm customers for each case file they direct us to process on the assumption that we would realize those operational efficiencies 
therefore  the failure to effectively customize our case management software system could impact our profitability under our services agreement with new law firm customers in our mortgage default processing services segment 
in  we intend to migrate our mortgage default processing operations in florida and at barrett ndex to the proprietary case management software system initially developed for use in michigan 
to the extent that we are unable to effectively migrate those operations  we may not be able to realize the operational efficiencies and capacity to handle files that we experienced prior to the migration 
risks relating to our business information division we depend on the economies and the demographics of our targeted sectors in the local and regional markets that we serve  and changes in those factors could have an adverse impact on our revenues  cash flows and profitability 
our advertising revenues and  to a lesser extent  circulation revenues depend upon a variety of factors specific to the legal  financial and real estate sectors of the markets our business information division serves 
these factors include  among others  the size and demographic characteristics of the population  including the number of companies and professionals in our targeted business sectors  and local economic conditions affecting these sectors 
for example  if the local economy or targeted business sector in a market we serve experiences a downturn  display and classified advertising  which constituted  and of our business information revenues in  and  respectively  generally decreases for our business information products that target such market or sector 
this was the case in  when our display and classified advertising revenues decreased million from and  to a lesser extent in  when these revenues decreased another million  due to a decrease in the number of ads placed in our publications as customers tightened discretionary spending in response to the local economic conditions in the markets we serve 
further  if the local economy in a market we serve experiences growth  public notices  which constituted  and of our business information revenues in  and  respectively  may decrease as a result of fewer foreclosure proceedings requiring the posting of public notices 
our business information division s revenues could be particularly affected by economic or demographic changes in maryland  minnesota or missouri because revenues from our publications targeting each of these markets accounted for more than of this division s revenues in and if the level of advertising in our business information products or public notices in our court and commercial newspapers were to decrease  our revenues  cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected 
a change in the laws governing public notice requirements  as well as new or increased regulation of residential mortgage products  may delay  reduce or eliminate the amount of public notices required to be published in print  affect how newspapers are chosen for the publication of public notices or adversely change the eligibility requirements for publishing public notices  which could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and growth opportunities 
in various states  legislatures have considered proposals that would eliminate or reduce the number of public notices required by statute 
in addition  some state legislatures have proposed that state and local governments publish official government notices themselves online 
the impetus for the passage of such laws may increase as online alternatives to print sources of information become more generally accepted 
some states have also proposed  enacted or interpreted laws to alter the frequency with which public notices are required to be published  reduce the amount of information required to be disclosed in public notices or change the requirements for publications to be eligible to publish public notices 
in addition  new or increased government regulation of residential mortgage defaults may result in fewer or delayed foreclosures and  therefore  the publication of fewer related public notices or a delay in the publication of related public notices 
further  legislation changing the public notices required to be published in print or that adversely change the eligibility requirements for publishing public notices in states where we publish or intend to publish court and commercial newspapers would adversely affect our public notice revenues and could adversely affect our ability to differentiate our business information products  which could have an adverse impact on our revenues  profitability and growth opportunities 
government regulations related to the internet could increase our cost of doing business  affect our ability to grow or may otherwise negatively affect our business 
governmental agencies and federal and state legislatures have adopted  and may continue to adopt  new laws and regulatory practices in response to the increasing use of the internet and other online services 
these new laws may be related to issues such as online privacy  copyrights  trademarks and service mark  sales taxes  fair business practices  domain name ownership and the requirement that our operating units register to do business as foreign entities or otherwise be licensed to do business in jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence 
in addition  these new laws  regulations or interpretations relating to doing business through the internet could increase our costs materially and adversely affect the revenues and results of operations in our business information division 
if we are unable to generate traffic to our online publications and other web sites and electronic services  our ability to continue to grow our business information division may be negatively affected 
we have devoted  and expect to devote  a significant amount of resources to distributing the information we provide through the internet  web sites  electronic mail and other online services and the growth of our business information division will increasingly depend upon our ability to effectively use these methods to provide information to our customers 
for these methods to be successful  we will need to attract and retain frequent visitors to our web sites or users of our other electronic services  develop and expand the content  products and other tools that we offer on our web sites and through other electronic services  attract advertisers to our web sites and other electronic services and continue to develop and upgrade our technologies 
if we are not successful in our efforts  our business information revenues and results of operations and our ability to grow this division will be adversely affected 
our business and reputation could suffer if third party providers of printing  delivery and outsourced technology services that we rely upon  as well as newspapers where we place foreclosure public notices fail to perform satisfactorily 
we outsource a significant amount of our printing to third party printing companies 
as a result  we are unable to ensure directly that the final printed product is of a quality acceptable to our subscribers 
we also outsource a significant amount of our technology and software systems support to third party information technology vendors 
further  we rely on public notice newspapers in the markets where we process mortgage default files  including detroit legal news publishing  to timely and accurately publish our foreclosure public notices 
to the extent that any of these third party providers do not perform their services satisfactorily  do not have the resources to meet our needs or decide or are unable to provide these services to us on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to provide timely and dependable business information products  as well as our professional services  could be adversely affected 
in addition  we could face increased costs or delays if we must identify and retain other third party providers of these services 
most of our print publications are delivered to our subscribers by the us postal service 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  delays in the delivery of our print publications by the us postal service 
to the extent we try to avoid these delays by using third party carriers other than the us postal service to deliver our print products  we will incur increased operating costs 
in addition  the us postal service is considering eliminating saturday delivery from its services 
to the extent this change is implemented  it may have an adverse affect on our minnesota and missouri business information operations  which publish saturday editions for certain of their papers 
in addition  timely delivery of our publications is extremely important to many of our advertisers  public notice publishers and subscribers 
any delays in delivery of our print publications to our subscribers could negatively affect our reputation  cause us to lose advertisers  public notice publishers and subscribers and limit our ability to attract new advertisers  public notice publishers and subscribers

f to fund  in part  the acquisition of barrett ndex  ndex made a capital call  in which neither apc investments nor feiwell hannoy participated  thereby diluting their interests 
the noncontrolling interest of apc investments and feiwell hannoy were further diluted when ndex issued a membership interest to the sellers of barrett ndex as a group on september  in partial consideration for the acquisition of barrett ndex 
g on december   apc investments made a pro rata distribution of its membership interest in ndex to its members  the trott sellers 
the pro rata distribution is not reflected in the table above

i on january   we acquired an aggregate of the noncontrolling interest in ndex from the trott sellers

the distributions are made pro rata in relation to the common membership units each member owns 
because the redeemable feature of the ndex noncontrolling interest is outside of our control  we adjust the noncontrolling interest to the redemption amount at each reporting period 
we have recorded this noncontrolling interest at the redemption amount  with the adjustment recorded through additional paid in capital rather than directly as a charge against earnings 
because the redemption amount is based upon a formula and deemed not at fair value  we have employed the two class method to calculate earnings per share based on net income loss from continuing operations attributable to the dolan company common stockholders

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  our total revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in  largely as a result of increased revenues in our litigation support services segment 
the litigation support revenue growth was driven primarily by our discoverready business which we acquired in november discoverready s revenues grew million in compared to when we only owned them for two months 
in addition  revenues from our ndex operations in florida  which we acquired in october  grew by million in our ndex operations in florida and the discoverready acquisition in the fourth quarter of  together accounted for the majority of the increase in our operating expenses in further  net income attributable to the dolan company increased to million for from million for the same period in as a result  net income attributable to the dolan company per diluted share increased from in to in recent developments new credit agreement on december   we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement  effective december  the new credit agreement  with a syndicate of bank lenders for a million senior secured credit facility comprised of a term loan facility in an initial aggregate amount of million due and payable in quarterly installments with a final maturity date of december  and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to million  which may be increased pursuant to an accordion feature to up to million  with a final maturity date of december  at any time after december   if the outstanding principal balance of revolving loans under the revolving credit facility of the new credit agreement exceeds million  million of such revolving loans shall convert to an amortizing term loan due and payable in quarterly installments with a final maturity date of december  the new credit agreement restated our previous credit agreement in its entirety 
in connection with this new credit facility  we paid approximately million in bank and legal fees 
please see cash flows from financing activities below for more discussion on our new credit agreement 
stock buy back plan our board of directors approved a stock buy back plan effective as of the closing of our new credit agreement on december  this plan allows us to repurchase up to million shares of issued and outstanding common stock at prevailing market prices or negotiated prices through december  the number of shares and the timing of the purchases will be determined at the discretion of management 
between february  and march   we repurchased  shares under this plan for an aggregate of million 
new investments in august  we made a investment in bringmethenews  llc bmtn  a minneapolis based online news source 
bmtn gathers local news from hundreds of online sources and distributes it through a network of online and social media sites 
it also produces daily radio newscasts that are broadcast on more than a dozen outlets 
we account for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
our investment balance at december   was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we formed a strategic partnership with telran  inc  a leading provider of statehouse legislative information  to launch a state  real time legislative reporting and data service 
the new service  headquartered in austin  texas  is called legislative information service of america lisa 
it will provide real time web based reporting on floor and committee actions  bill filings  and other legislative activity 
it features customized real time tracking  alerts  full text searches  daily calendars and critical analytical tools aimed at bills as they are filed and debated in statehouses across the united states 
we own of the equity interests in lisa  and consolidate this entity  recording noncontrolling interest for the not owned by us 
increase in our ownership in ndex on december  and january   we  along with our wholly owned subsidiary  dolan apc  llc  entered into two separate common unit purchase agreements with the trott sellers  under the terms of which the trott sellers sold an aggregate ownership interest in ndex to us  for an aggregate purchase price of million and  shares of our common stock 
of the million cash due to the trott sellers  we have paid million through the date of this annual report on form k 
we will pay the remaining balance to the trott sellers in equal monthly installments of approximately million  in the aggregate  which includes interest accruing on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of david a 
trott and the other trott sellers are partners in the law firm  trott trott  pc  which is a customer of ndex 
trott is the managing partner of trott trott  pc and we also employ him as the chairman and chief executive officer of ndex  where he is one of our executive officers 
under the common units purchase agreements described above where we purchased an aggregate ownership interest in ndex  trott sold us his ownership interest in ndex for which we will pay him an aggregate of million exclusive of interest and for which we issued to him  shares of our common stock 
see also related party transactions and policies david a 
trott in our proxy statement  which is expected to be filed with the sec in early april  for a description of certain other relationships between trott  his law firm or his other affiliated entities and us 
each trott seller had the right  until february   to require ndex to repurchase their respective membership interest in ndex at a price based on times ndex s trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization less the aggregate amount of any interest bearing indebtedness outstanding for ndex as of the repurchase date 
the present value of the total consideration paid to the trott sellers in connection with the sale of their respective ndex interests to us approximated the price we would have paid to the trott sellers had they elected to exercise  in full  their put right set forth in the ndex operating agreement 
on february   ndex redeemed  common units  representing a interest in ndex  from feiwell hannoy  in connection with feiwell hannoy s exercise of its put right as set forth in the ndex operating agreement 
ndex redeemed these common units for million  which was determined pursuant to the formula set forth in ndex s operating agreement 
the redemption price is payable to feiwell hannoy over a period of three years  in quarterly installments  with interest accruing at a rate of 
we have paid million on this note through the date of this annual report on form k 
feiwell hannoy is a law firm customer of ndex 
after the closing of the transactions described above  our ownership interest in ndex increased from to 
new line of business in professional services division on november   we entered a new line of business in our professional services division with the acquisition of an interest in discoverready llc 
discoverready is a leading provider of outsourced discovery management and document review services to major united states and global companies and their counsel 
discoverready is headquartered in new york city  with an office in charlotte  north carolina 
in accordance with the terms of the discoverready operating agreement  we repurchased a equity interest in discoverready from dr holdco in connection with the expiration of the employment agreement of discoverready s former chief financial officer in april  thereby increasing our ownership percentage in discoverready to 
discovery is the process by which parties use the legal system to obtain relevant information  primarily in litigation and regulatory matters 
this process can be expensive and time consuming for companies depending upon the volume of emails  electronic files and paper documents a company must review to respond to a document request 
discoverready assists these companies and their counsel in document reviews and helping these companies manage the discovery process 
discoverready also provides related technology management services 
none of our key employees or executive officers has any previous experience in operating a discovery management and document review services company 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into three year employment agreements with discoverready co founders james k 
wagner  jr 
and steven r 
harber to continue to serve as discoverready s chief executive officer and president  respectively  as well as other key employees of discoverready  and will rely on them to assist our executive officers in operating this business 
messrs 
wagner and harber  along with other employees of discoverready  indirectly own the remaining equity interest in discoverready 
discoverready is part of our professional services division and litigation support services segment 
our litigation support services segment was a new reportable segment in and includes the operations of discoverready and counsel press which was previously part of our professional services segment with ndex 
the operations of ndex are now called our mortgage default processing services segment 
both our mortgage default processing services and litigation support services segments are part of our professional services division 
regulatory environment beginning in  federal  state and local governmental entities and leaders have increasingly focused attention on foreclosures and have proposed  and in some cases  enacted legislation or taken other action that may have  and some of which has had  an adverse impact on the number of mortgage default case files ndex is asked to process  the length of time it takes to process such files  the time over which we recognize revenue associated with the processing of those files  and the number of foreclosure public notices placed in our business information products and dlnp our minority investment for publication 
this legislation includes the hope for homeowners act of  the emergency economic stabilization act  the streamlined modification program  and the homeowner affordability and stability plan including the making home affordable program  the home affordable modification program hamp  and the home affordable foreclosure alternatives program hafa  the protecting tenants at foreclosure act  and laws passed to mitigate foreclosures in california  maryland  michigan  indiana  and florida 
there also have been voluntary foreclosure relief programs developed by lenders  loan servicers and the hope new alliance a consortium that includes loan servicers 
we have described these programs in our previous annual and quarterly reports in each of the previous few years 
overall  included some additional legislation aimed at mitigating foreclosures  additional scrutiny on mortgage foreclosures  and voluntary stoppages of foreclosures by servicers and lenders 
in february  the president announced a new billion funding initiative  called the fha hardest hit fund  to provide money for housing finance agencies or fhas in nevada  michigan  california  florida and arizona 
the hardest hit fund was created to offer what the president s administration called relief in direct proportion to the scale of each state s housing challenges 
the fha hardest hit program gives lenders in these five states more flexibility to create programs designed to prevent a mortgage from going into default or foreclosure including loan modification  mortgage forbearance  and principal reduction for borrowers who are over leveraged or have severe negative equity 
in june  new federal government directives concerning certain aspects of the federal home affordable modification program hamp became effective 
among other things  the supplemental directives included clarification of the requirement to solicit all borrowers whose first mortgage loans are potentially eligible for hamp  a prohibition against referral to foreclosure until either a borrower has been determined to be ineligible for hamp or reasonable solicitation efforts have failed  and a requirement that a servicer provide a certification to the foreclosure attorney or trustee stating that a borrower is not hamp eligible before a foreclosure sale may be conducted 
in july  a foreclosure mediation bill took effect in maryland 
this bill required the opportunity for court mediation for every owner occupied residential foreclosure within days of an owner s request 
we believe this bill contributed to a slowdown of foreclosure notices in maryland during the latter part of in late  a change to the servicemembers civil relief act scra increased the number of months before a servicer can foreclose on a loan where the debtor is in the military 
previously the servicemembers civil relief act scra had a month delay from the time a servicemember was released from active duty before a foreclosure action could start 
the mandatory delay has been increased to months 
beginning in september  mortgage foreclosures received additional scrutiny due to widespread national media coverage of reported procedural and documentation error and lapses by other parties in the industry 
the state attorneys general coordinated to review the foreclosure process 
in most states the attorney general requested additional information about the foreclosure process  while in some states the attorney general requested a temporary freeze on foreclosure sales 
certain servicers reacted to the attention being paid to the foreclosure process by various other government officials and constituencies  with self imposed foreclosure sale and eviction moratoria in the fall of while these servicers verified their internal policies and procedures 
certain servicers also reacted to this environment of increased scrutiny in by requesting additional information and process verification from law firms and vendors to which they refer their mortgage foreclosures 
in the fall of  numerous servicers halted foreclosures in the judicial states 
in judicial states  the court system approves the foreclosures based on evidence such as affidavits  whereas in non judicial states the foreclosure occurs outside the court system with different types of documents 
some servicers have lifted these moratoria  and others have not 
the halt on foreclosure sales has caused a slowdown of foreclosure referrals as servicers and creditors have appeared to focus on processes and other internal and external issues 
ndex operates in only two judicial states  indiana and florida 
the halt on foreclosures and the slowdown of referrals negatively impacted our revenue in indiana  but ndex revenue in florida remained strong due to opportunities presented there for market share increases due to circumstances and investigations experienced by law firms in florida unrelated to albertelli or ndex 
in february  the department of the treasury submitted a report to congress entitled reforming america s housing finance market which included a plan to responsibly reduce the role of the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac in the mortgage market and expressed a goal of ultimately winding down both institutions 
many of the files we process are supported by fannie mae or freddie mac  therefore any change to these institutions  or broader changes to the mortgage market as a whole  may adversely impact the number of mortgage default files received by our law firm customers from their clients and therefore the number directed they direct to us to process and received by us for processing in california and nevada by our mortgage lender and loan servicer customers 
these and other laws  proposed legislation  investigations  directives  voluntary programs  actions  plans  and court orders  have delayed  and may delay in the future  the referral of files to our law firm customers  or in the case of foreclosures on properties located in california and nevada  the referral of files directly to us for processing 
in addition  they may continue to increase the processing time for the foreclosure files between the referral to the attorney or trustee and the foreclosure sale and may affect margins 
in some instances they may continue to increase the time over which we recognize revenue associated with the processing of such files  and may continue to decrease the number of foreclosure public notices placed in our business information products and dlnp our minority investment for publication 
recent acquisitions we consummated the following acquisitions in datastream content solutions  llc on december   we acquired datastream content solutions  llc datastream 
in connection with this acquisition  we paid the sellers million in cash at closing  held back million payable months after closing to secure indemnification claims  and are obligated to pay up to an additional million in earnouts in two annual installments 
the amount of the two annual earnout payments is based upon the acquired business achieving certain ebitda targets during the calendar years ending december  and federal news service  inc on august   we acquired certain assets of federal news service  inc federal news for approximately million in cash 
for more information on the products and services these companies provide  see our products and services business information earlier in this annual report 
revenues we derive revenues from our two operating divisions  our professional services division and our business information division  operating as three reportable segments mortgage default processing services  litigation support services  and business information 
for the year ended december   our total revenues were million  and the percentage of our total revenues attributed to each of our divisions and segments was as follows from our professional services division from mortgage default processing services and from litigation support services  and from our business information division 
professional service division 
our professional services division generates revenues primarily by providing mortgage default processing  outsourced discovery management and document review  and appellate services through fee based arrangements 
we further break down our professional services division into two reportable segments  mortgage default processing services and litigation support services 
mortgage default processing services 
through ndex  we assist eight law firms in processing foreclosure  bankruptcy  eviction and to a lesser extent  litigation and other mortgage default processing case files for residential mortgages that are in default 
we also provide foreclosure processing services directly to mortgage lenders and loan servicers for properties located in california and nevada 
in addition  ndex provides loan modification and loss mitigation support on mortgage default files to its customers and related real estate title work to the barrett law firm 
shareholders and or principal attorneys of our law firm customers  including david a 
trott  chairman and chief executive officer of ndex  are executive management employees of ndex 
for the year ended december   we received approximately  mortgage default case files for processing 
our mortgage default processing service revenues accounted for of our total revenues and of our professional services division s revenues during we recognize mortgage default processing services revenues over the period during which the services are provided 
we consolidate the operations  including revenues  of ndex and record a noncontrolling interest adjustment for the percentage of earnings that we do not own 
see noncontrolling interest below for a description of the impact of the noncontrolling interest in ndex on our operating results 
with the exception of foreclosure files we process for our law firm customer  feiwell hannoy  and california and nevada foreclosure files  we bill our customers upon receipt of the file and record amounts billed for services not yet performed as deferred revenue 
for foreclosure files we process for feiwell hannoy  we bill feiwell hannoy in two installments and record amounts for services performed but not yet billed as unbilled services and amounts billed for services not yet performed as deferred revenue 
for california and nevada foreclosure files processed by us  we bill our customers for services at the time the file is complete and record amounts related to services performed  but not yet billed  as unbilled services 
in california and nevada  because we provide mortgage default processing services directly to mortgage lenders and loan servicers  we incur certain costs on behalf of our customers  such as trustee sale guarantees  title policies  and post and publication charges 
we pass these costs directly through to our mortgage lender and loan servicers customers  and bill them at the time the file is complete 
we have determined that these expenses should be recorded at net and  accordingly  do not record any revenue for these pass through costs 
we also provide title services primarily to the barrett law firm  and we bill for these services when the title matter is completed and recognize revenue as we perform the services 
ndex s revenues are primarily driven by the number of residential mortgage defaults in each of the states for which it processes files as well as the quantity and mix of the files we process eg  foreclosures  evictions  bankruptcies or litigation because each has a different pricing structure 
we have entered into long term services agreements with each of our law firm customers 
these agreements provide for the exclusive referral of files from the law firms to ndex for servicing  except that the barrett law firm and trott trott may refer files elsewhere if they are otherwise directed by clients 
during  each of the barrett law firm and trott trott accounted for more than of our mortgage default processing services revenues  with the barrett law firm accounting for of these revenues and trott trott accounting for of these revenues 
our services agreements with trott trott and the barrett law firm have initial terms that expire in and  respectively 
however  these terms may be automatically extended for up to two successive ten year periods  in the case of our agreement with trott trott  or successive five year periods  in the case of our agreement with the barrett law firm  unless either party elects to terminate the term then in effect with prior notice 
the initial terms of our services agreements with our other law firm customers expire between to  which terms may be automatically extended for up to two successive five or ten year periods depending upon the law firm customer unless either party elects to terminate the term then in effect with prior notice 
under each services agreement  we are paid a fixed fee for each residential mortgage default file the law firm sends to us for processing  with the amount of such fixed fee being based upon the type of file 
we receive this fixed fee upon receipt of a default case file  which consists of any mortgage default case file sent to us for processing  regardless of whether the case actually proceeds to foreclosure 
if such file leads to a bankruptcy  eviction or litigation proceeding  we are entitled to an additional fixed fee in connection with handling a file for such proceedings 
we also receive a fixed fee for handling files in eviction  litigation and bankruptcy matters that do not originate from mortgage foreclosure files 
the barrett law firm also pays us a monthly trustee foreclosure administration fee 
although the services agreements with our law firm customers contemplate the review and possible revision of the fees for the services we provide  price increases have not historically affected our mortgage default processing services revenues materially 
in some cases  our services agreements adjust the fee paid to us for the files we process on an annual basis pursuant to an agreed upon consumer price index 
in other cases  our services agreements require us to agree with our law firm customer regarding the terms and amount of any fee increase 
deferred revenue includes revenues billed for mortgage default processing services that we expect to recognize in future periods due to the extended period of time it takes to process certain files 
at december   we had such deferred revenue on our balance sheet in the amount of million 
litigation support services 
our litigation support services segment generates revenues by providing discovery management and document review services through discoverready and appellate services through counsel press 
for the year ended december   our litigation support services revenues accounted for of our total revenues and of our professional services division s revenues 
discoverready provides its services to major united states and global companies and their counsel and assists them in document reviews and helping them manage the discovery process 
discovery is the process by which parties use the legal system to obtain relevant information  primarily in litigation and regulatory matters 
this process can be expensive and time consuming for companies depending upon the volume of emails  electronic files and paper documents a company must review to respond to a document request 
discoverready also provides related technology management services 
discoverready bills its customers primarily based upon the number of documents reviewed and the amount of data or other information it processes in connection with those reviews 
accordingly  our discovery management and document review services revenue are largely determined by the volume of data we review 
our discovery management and document review services revenue accounted for of our total revenues  of our litigation support services segment revenues  and of our total professional services division revenues for the year ended december  during  discoverready s top two customers  both of whom are in the financial services industry  accounted for  in the aggregate  of discoverready s total revenues 
counsel press assists law firms and attorneys throughout the united states in organizing  preparing and filing appellate briefs  records and appendices  in paper and electronic formats  that comply with the applicable rules of the us supreme court  any of the federal courts of appeals and any state appellate court or appellate division 
counsel press charges its customers primarily on a per page basis based on the final appellate product that is filed with the court clerk 
accordingly  our appellate service revenues are largely determined by the volume of appellate cases we handle and the number of pages in the appellate cases we file 
for the year ended december   our appellate services revenues accounted for of our total revenues  of our litigation support services revenues  and of our total professional services division revenues 
we recognize litigation support services revenues during the month in which the services are provided 
in the case of counsel press  this is when our final appellate product is filed with the court 
we consolidate the operations of discoverready and record an adjustment for noncontrolling interest for the percentage of discoverready that we do not own 
because the redeemable feature of this noncontrolling interest is based on fair value unlike the noncontrolling interest in ndex  we are not required to record this adjustment as an item affecting net income attributable to the dolan company common stockholders 
see noncontrolling interest below 
business information 
our business information division generates revenues primarily from display and classified advertising  public notices and subscriptions 
we sell commercial advertising  which consists of display and classified advertising in our print products and web sites 
we include within our display and classified advertising revenue those revenues generated by sponsorships  advertising and ticket sales generated by our local events 
our display and classified advertising revenues accounted for of our total revenues and of our business information division revenues for the year ended december  we recognize display and classified advertising revenues upon placement of an advertisement in one of our publications or on one of our web sites 
we recognize display and classified advertising revenues generated by sponsorships  advertising and ticket sales from local events when those events are held 
advertising revenues are driven primarily by the volume  price and mix of advertisements published  as well as how many local events are held 
we publish more than different types of public notices in our court and commercial newspapers  including foreclosure notices  probate notices  notices of fictitious business names  limited liability company and other entity notices  unclaimed property notices  notices of governmental hearings and trustee sale notices 
our public notice revenues accounted for of our total revenues and of our business information division revenues for the year ended december  we recognize public notice revenues upon placement of a public notice in one of our court and commercial newspapers 
public notice revenues are driven by the volume and mix of public notices published 
this is primarily affected by the number of residential mortgage foreclosures in the markets where we are qualified to publish public notices and the rules governing publication of public notices in such states 
in six of the states in which we publish public notices  the price for public notices is statutorily regulated  with market forces determining the pricing for the remaining states 
we sell our business information products  including our datastream and federal news products and services  primarily through subscriptions 
for the year ended december   our subscription and other revenues  which consist primarily of subscriptions  single copy sales  transcriptions and access to state and federal legislative information  accounted for of our total revenues and of our business information division s revenues 
we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the subscription periods  which range from three months to multiple years  with the average subscription period being twelve months 
deferred revenue includes payment for subscriptions collected in advance that we expect to recognize in future periods 
at december   we had such deferred revenue on our balance sheet in the amount of million 
subscription and other revenues are primarily driven by the number of copies sold and the subscription rates charged to customers 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of the following direct operating expenses  which consist primarily of the cost of compensation and employee benefits for the operational staff at ndex  discoverready  and counsel press and our editorial personnel in our business information division  production and distribution expenses  such as compensation including stock based compensation expense and employee benefits for personnel involved in the production and distribution of our business information products  the cost of newsprint and delivery of our business information products  and packaging and data service fees in connection with our california and nevada foreclosure files  selling  general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of the cost of compensation including stock based compensation expense and employee benefits for our sales  human resources  accounting and information technology personnel  publishers and other members of management  rent  other sales and marketing related expenses and other office related payments  depreciation expense  which represents the cost of fixed assets and software allocated over the estimated useful lives of these assets  with such useful lives ranging from one to thirty years  and amortization expense  which represents the cost of finite life intangibles acquired through business combinations allocated over the estimated useful lives of these intangibles  with such useful lives ranging from two to thirty years 
total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  and depend upon our mix of business from professional services  which is our higher margin revenue  and business information 
this mix may continue to shift between fiscal periods and over time as professional services revenues continue to grow at a faster pace that business information revenues

we own of the membership interests in the detroit legal news publishing  llc dlnp  the publisher of the detroit legal news and ten other publications 
we account for our investment in dlnp using the equity method 
for the years ended december   and  our percentage share of dlnp s earnings was million  million and million  respectively  which we recognized as operating income 
ndex handles all public notices required to be published in connection with files it processes for trott trott pursuant to our services agreement with trott trott and places a significant amount of these notices in the detroit legal news 
trott trott pays dlnp for these public notices

in  we invested in of the membership interests in bringmethenews  llc bmtn 
the net investment balance in bmtn at december  is million 
please refer to recent developments new investments above for further information about our investment in bmtn 
on december   we sold our investment in govdelivery in connection with its merger with internet capital group 
we received million in cash upon the consummation of the sale  with an additional million held back for the payment of indemnification claims pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement 
accordingly  we recorded a gain on our sale of this investment in in the amount of million  which was included in other income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ending december  in  we received million of the amount held back  and have included this in other income for the year ended december  noncontrolling interest from january   through november   the noncontrolling interest consisted of an aggregate interest in ndex held by apc investments  llc  feiwell hannoy and the sellers of barrett ndex or their transferees as a group 
apc investments was a limited liability company owned by ndex chairman and chief executive officer  david a 
trott  and the other shareholders of trott trott  an ndex customer 
beginning on november   the noncontrolling interest also included a interest in discoverready llc held by dr holdco llc  which was reduced to as a result of our repurchase of the equity interest in discoverready from dr holdco in connection with the expiration of the employment agreement of the former cfo of discoverready in april 
at december   the noncontrolling interest in ndex changed to an aggregate interest as a result of our acquisition of a interest in ndex from the trott sellers who were the members of apc investments 
in the first quarter of  we acquired the remaining interest in ndex held by the trott sellers  as well as redeemed feiwell hannoy s interest in ndex  all of which reduced the noncontrolling interest in ndex to which is held by the sellers of barrett ndex or their transferees 
you should refer to recent developments increase in our ownership in ndex earlier in this annual report for information about the change in our ownership in ndex during the years ended december  and in the fourth quarter of  we formed legislative services of america lisa  and consolidate this entity 
we record noncontrolling interest for the we do not own

under the terms of the ndex operating agreement  each month  we are required to distribute the excess of ndex s earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization less debt service with respect to any interest bearing indebtedness of ndex  capital expenditures and working capital reserves to ndex s members on the basis of common equity interest owned 
we paid the following distributions during the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  apc investments feiwell hannoy sellers of barrett ndex as a group total the sellers of barrett ndex or their transferees  each as members of ndex  have the right  for a period of six months following september   to require ndex to repurchase all or any portion of their respective membership interest in ndex 
to the extent any seller of barrett ndex timely exercises this right  the purchase price of such membership interest will be based on times ndex s trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization less the aggregate amount of any interest bearing indebtedness outstanding for ndex as of the date the repurchase occurs 
the aggregate purchase price would be payable by ndex in the form of a three year unsecured note bearing interest at a rate equal to prime plus 
under the terms of the discoverready limited liability agreement  dr holdco who holds the noncontrolling interest in discoverready has the right  for a period of ninety days following november   to require discoverready to repurchase all or any portion of its equity interest in discoverready 
to the extent that dr holdco timely exercises this right  the purchase price of such equity interest will be based on the fair market value of such interest 
during that same period  we also have the right to require dr holdco to sell its entire equity interest in discoverready to us 
if we timely exercise our right  we would pay dr holdco an amount based on the fair market value of the equity interest 
these rights may be exercised earlier under the following circumstances an individual seller of discoverready may require discoverready to repurchase the portion of dr holdco s interest in discoverready that he beneficially owns if he is terminated without cause or quits for good reason prior to the expiration of his employment agreement 
if we terminate any individual seller of discoverready for cause or if such seller quits without good reason  we can require dr holdco to sell to us the portion of its interest in discoverready that reflects such seller s beneficial interest in us 
the purchase price for that portion of the equity interest repurchased or sold if these rights are exercised based on the interest s fair market value 
with respect to the former cfo of discoverready  in we repurchased that portion of dr holdco s interest in discoverready which he beneficially owned  upon the expiration of his employment agreement 
as a result  our ownership interest in discoverready increased to  and the noncontrolling interest in discoverready was reduced to 
the discoverready operating agreement does not require us to pay any monthly cash distributions to dr holdco  however  we are obligated to make distributions to dr holdco to pay its tax liabilities 
during the year ended december   we made such distributions of million to dr holdco 
no such distributions were made in discoverready may engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair market value of the equity interest being repurchased by discoverready or sold to us if any of the above described rights are exercised 
the purchase price for any equity interests repurchased or sold pursuant to these rights  if exercised  will be paid in cash to the extent allowed by the terms of our then existing credit agreement  or pursuant to a three year unsecured promissory note  bearing interest at a rate equal to prime plus 
we are required to record the redeemable noncontrolling interests nci in ndex and discoverready to their redemption amounts at each reporting period 
the ndex nci is adjusted to the estimated redemption amount at each reporting period based on the formula as discussed above 
the discoverready nci is adjusted to fair value each period 
during the year ended december   the adjustments recorded to the nci for ndex were million net of tax  and the adjustments recorded to the nci for discoverready were million net of tax 
please see our audited consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income  as well as note to our audited consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form k for further information regarding accounting for noncontrolling interests and its implications to our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  information provided by third party professionals and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances at the time these estimates and assumptions are made 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in applying these critical accounting policies 
we believe the critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates  assumptions and judgments to be used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are business combinations  revenue recognition in connection with mortgage default processing services  impairment of intangible assets and other long lived assets  fair value of discoverready s noncontrolling interest  share based compensation expense  income taxes  and accounts receivable allowances 
business combinations we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we expect to acquire additional businesses in the future 
in a business combination  we determine the fair value of all acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and all assumed liabilities 
the fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining fair value of the acquired business is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable  finite life intangible assets  such as mastheads  trade names and advertising  subscriber and other customer lists  are amortized over the intangible asset s future cash flows 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from two to thirty years 
goodwill  as well as other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives  is not amortized 
accordingly  the accounting for acquisitions has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our operating results 
during the year ended december   we applied business combination accounting to the following acquisitions the assets of federal news on august   and the equity interests of datastream on december  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information about the application of business combination accounting to these acquisitions 
revenue recognition we recognize mortgage default processing service revenues on a proportional performance basis over the period during which the services are provided  the calculation of which requires management to make significant estimates as to the appropriate length of the revenue recognition period and allocation of revenues within those periods 
we base these estimates primarily upon our historical experience and our knowledge of processing cycles in each of the states in which we do business  as well as recent legislative changes which impact the processing period 
our revenue recognition periods for mortgage default processing services revenues ranges from one to months 
because of the extended time over which we may recognize these revenues  we carry a balance of deferred revenues on our balance sheet  representing revenues billed but not yet earned 
as of december  and  we recorded an aggregate million and million  respectively  as deferred revenues related to mortgage default processing services on our balance sheet 
we record revenues recognized for services performed  but not yet billed  to our customers as unbilled services 
as of december  and  we recorded an aggregate million and million  respectively  as unbilled services and included these amounts in accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
intangible assets and other long lived assets we test our indefinite lived intangible assets which primarily includes goodwill annually for impairment using a november measurement date 
we test all finite life intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  for impairment whenever circumstances or events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of these assets is below its carrying value 
circumstances that could represent triggering events and therefore require an interim impairment test of goodwill or evaluation of our finite life intangible assets or other long lived assets include the following loss of key personnel  unanticipated competition  higher or earlier than expected customer attrition  deterioration of operating performance  significant adverse industry  economic or regulatory changes or a significant decline in market capitalization 
we have determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets during  nor any triggering events which would require an impairment of our finite life intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate the estimated economic lives and related amortization expense for our finite life intangible assets 
to the extent actual useful lives are less than our previously estimated lives  we will increase our amortization expense on a prospective basis 
we estimate useful lives of our intangible assets by reference to both contractual arrangements  and current and projected cash flows 
the determination of useful lives and whether long lived assets are impaired includes the use of accounting estimates and assumptions  changes in which could materially impact our financial condition and operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions 
during the year ended december   we did not revise any of the existing lives of our finite life intangible assets 
at december   we had total indefinite lived intangible assets of million  including goodwill of million 
goodwill was attributed to our four reporting units as follows business information segment million  mortgage default processing services segment million and from the two subsidiaries in our litigation support services segment  discoverready million and counsel press million 
the first step of our test for impairment of goodwill requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying value 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow approach and a comparative market approach 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of projected future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
the market approach provides indications of value based on market multiples for public companies involved in similar lines of business 
the fair values derived from these valuation methods are then weighted to determine an estimated fair value for each reporting unit  which is compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine whether impairment exists 
we then compared the total fair values for all reporting units to our overall market capitalization as a test of the reasonableness of this approach 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and we must perform the second step of the impairment test 
the second step involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the testing date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
because the carrying value for each of our reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values  we did not need to perform this second step 
in determining the fair values of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow approach  we considered our projected operating results and then made a number of assumptions 
these assumptions included those of market participants regarding future business plans  economic projections and market data as well as management estimates regarding future cash flows and operating results 
the key assumptions we used in preparing our discounted cash flow analysis are projected cash flows  risk adjusted discount rate  and expected long term growth rate 
we based our comparative market approach on the valuation multiples enterprise value divided by ebitda of a selected group of peer companies 
we then used an average of these multiples to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units 
the assumptions we used in estimating our reporting units fair values are sensitive and variances in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the determination of impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
further  we cannot predict what future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
these events include  but are not limited to  any strategic decisions we may make in response to economic or competitive conditions affecting our reporting units and the effect of the economic and regulatory environment on our business 
if we are required to take an impairment charge in the future  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  any such charge  if taken  will not have any impact on our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our current credit agreement because goodwill impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda for purposes of meeting the total cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios in that agreement and because there is no net worth minimum covenant 
future credit agreements may  however  contain covenants that may be impacted by such non cash impairment charges 
using an equal weighting of the discounted cash flow and comparative market approaches  which is consistent with prior years  each of our reporting units passed step one of the impairment test  as their estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values 
in our discounted cash flow approach  we have assumed that any foreclosure related state or federal government and or lender based programs would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
if such legislative programs are enacted or lender based programs are expanded  there may be a delay or reduction in the number of mortgage default files that our customers send to us for processing and therefore a decline in cash flows 
such future reductions or delays in mortgage default file processing could have an impact on the estimated fair value under both approaches we used 
as a test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values for our reporting units  as determined under both the discounted cash flow analysis and comparative market approach described above  we compared the aggregate weighted fair value for our reporting units under these approaches to the fair value of the company  as a whole 
we computed the company s fair value  as of november   by multiplying a the closing price for a share of our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange by b the number of outstanding shares of our common stock  and adding a control premium of  and adding the amount of outstanding long term debt  which was the only asset or liability that we did not allocate to a reporting unit 
we refer to this calculation as the market capitalization approach 
we have applied a control premium to our market capitalization analysis because such premiums are typically paid in acquisitions of publicly traded companies 
these control premiums represent the ability of an acquirer to control the operations of the business 
using the market capitalization approach described above  our company had an estimated fair value of million  which exceeds the aggregate carrying value of our individual reporting units of million  which we calculated using an equal weighting of the discounted cash flow and market approaches described above 
this confirmed the conclusion from our discounted cash flow and comparative market approaches discussed above that our indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired as of our measurement date 
after evaluating the results of each of these analyses  we believe that the discounted cash flow and comparative market approaches provide reasonable estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 
we will continue to evaluate whether circumstances and events have changed  thereby requiring us to conduct an interim test of our indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill and other finite life assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information about our intangible assets 
fair value of discoverready s noncontrolling interest because discoverready s noncontrolling interest is redeemable outside of our control  we are required to adjust it to fair value at each reporting period 
in  we increased the value of the noncontrolling interest in discoverready by million million net of tax as a result of this adjustment 
share based compensation expense under our incentive compensation plan  we have reserved for issuance million shares of common stock which was increased in from million shares  of which approximately million shares were available for grant as of december  our incentive compensation plan provides for awards in the form of incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock units  deferred shares  performance units and other stock based awards 
we recognize all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options and shares of restricted stock  based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we estimate the fair value of share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model at the grant date  with compensation expense recognized as the requisite service is rendered 
we have not issued any market performance based awards 
we have used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value on the date of grant of the stock option awards that we issued  using the closing share price of our common stock on the grant date for all options issued subsequent to our initial public offering 
in connection with our black scholes option pricing model  we calculated the expected term of stock option awards by using the period over which we expect the option holder will hold the stock options 
we estimate forfeitures of share based awards at the time of grant and revise such estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from projections 
for stock options issued  we have assumed a six percent forfeiture rate for all awards issued to non executive management and other employees and non employee directors  and a zero percent forfeiture rate for all awards issued to executive management employees 
we also made assumptions with respect to expected stock price volatility based on the average historical volatility of a select peer group of similar companies  or on a mix of the volatility of the price of our own common stock and that of these peer companies as we develop more trading history and therefore can begin to place more reliance on our stock price volatility 
in addition  we chose to use the risk free interest rate for the us treasury zero coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a bond with a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
our incentive compensation plan allows for the issuance of restricted stock awards that may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certain restrictions have lapsed 
we determine the share based expense for restricted stock awards based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to fully vest 
for restricted stock issued  we have assumed a seven percent forfeiture rate on all restricted stock awards issued to non management employees  a six percent forfeiture rate on all restricted stock awards issued to non executive management employees  and a zero percent forfeiture rate on restricted stock awards issued to a limited number of executive employees 
compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period

income taxes income taxes are recognized for the following amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which could require an extended period of time to resolve 
the completion of these audits could result in an increase to amounts previously paid to the taxing jurisdictions 
the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in various tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information pertaining to income taxes 
accounts receivable allowances we extend credit to our customers  including advertisers  public notice publishers  professional service customers and others  based upon an evaluation of each customer s financial condition  and collateral is generally not required 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
specifically  we use prior credit losses as a percentage of credit sales  the aging of accounts receivable and specific identification of potential losses to establish reserves for credit losses on accounts receivable 
we consider accounting for our allowance for doubtful accounts critical to our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could have a material effect on our financial statements

you should refer to the more detailed discussions in professional services division results and business information division results below for more information regarding the causes of these increases 
partially offsetting these increases in our operating divisions was a million year over year decrease in unallocated costs in our corporate operations 
the primary reason for this decrease is that in  we incurred a number of large medical claims  and our medical insurance allocations to our divisions were not sufficient to cover such costs 
in  we increased our allocations in order to cover anticipated claims  thus resulting in lower costs that remained in corporate 
this change resulted in a million year over year decrease in unallocated medical insurance costs in corporate 
for the total company  our medical costs increased million 
also contributing to the decrease in unallocated costs in our corporate operations was a million severance expense recorded in in connection with the elimination of an executive officer position  for which we had no similar expense in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was relatively constant at for compared to for depreciation and amortization expense 
our depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of the finalization of the purchase price accounting late in the third quarter of recorded in connection with the barrett ndex acquisition  which resulted in a higher allocation to depreciable software 
our amortization expense decreased primarily because of the additional million of amortization expense recorded in associated with the non compete intangible asset attributable to michael barrett  a senior officer at barrett ndex  which was fully amortized in as a result of his death in january additionally  the finalization of the purchase price allocation in of the intangible assets associated with the barrett ndex acquisition resulted in a reduction to amortizable intangible assets  and  therefore  a reduction in amortization expense 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in amortization expense of million as a result of the discoverready acquisition

cash interest incurred on our interest rate swaps increased primarily as a result of the increase in the notional amount of our swaps  and  to a lesser extent  interest rate changes 
amortization of deferred financing fees increased as a result of the write off in of certain financing fees related to our previous credit facility 
non cash interest income related to interest rate swaps for the years ended december  increase s in millions non cash interest income related to interest rate swaps non cash interest income related to interest rate swaps  for which we do not apply hedge accounting  increased million

income tax expense for  as a percentage of income before income taxes  was compared to for income tax expense for was favorably impacted by the receipt of non taxable life insurance proceeds which accounts for of the rate differential year over year 
professional services division results revenues for the years ended december  increase s in millions total professional services division revenues mortgage default processing service segment revenues litigation support services segment revenues our professional services revenues increased primarily as a result of increased revenues in our litigation support services segment  driven by our discoverready business which we acquired in november discoverready s revenues grew million in compared to when we only owned them for two months 
these operations generated million in revenues during the discoverready operations generated million in  of which million was generated under previous ownership and thus not included in our operating results for 
the increase in discoverready s revenues resulted primarily from increased volume from two major customers  both of whom are in the financial services industry 
counsel press revenues  another component of the litigation support services segment  grew year over year on higher case volumes 
the increase in mortgage default processing services revenues of was primarily driven by a million increase in revenues from our ndex operation in florida which we acquired in october these operations generated million in revenues during the ndex florida operations generated million during the period we owned them in  having received approximately  files for processing during compared to  files in  of which  were received for processing under previous ownership 
for the year ended december   we received for processing approximately  mortgage default case files compared to approximately  mortgage default case files that we received for processing for the year ended december  excluding the  files received by our operations in florida  the file volume from our existing ndex business was relatively flat year over year less than decrease  with some of our geographic locations experiencing growth  while other saw volume decreases 
we believe these flat volumes are due  in part  to the various regulatory and marketplace dynamics experienced in as described more fully in recent developments regulatory environment earlier in this annual report 
we continue to believe that these programs will not be effective in permanently modifying the large number of delinquent loans  which constitute the pipeline for foreclosure referrals 
the barrett law firm and trott trott each accounted for more than  and together accounted for approximately of our mortgage default processing services segment and of our professional services division revenues in for the same period in  trott trott and the barrett law firm each accounted for more than of our mortgage default processing services segment and professional services division revenues 
the top two customers in our litigation support services segment together accounted for nearly of our litigation support services revenues and of professional services division revenues 
operating expenses mortgage default processing services for the years ended december  increase decrease s in millions total operating expenses direct operating expense selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation expense amortization expense total operating expenses in this segment increased largely as a result of the operating costs of our ndex operations in florida acquired in october these operations accounted for million of the increase in direct operating expenses  and million of the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
a portion of the increase in florida s direct operating expenses is due to investments being made to prepare for anticipated volume increases 
these investments include personnel  facilities  and systems 
of the million of selling  general and administrative expenses from the florida operations  million is attributable to the fair value adjustment related to the earnout liability recorded in connection with this acquisition 
direct operating expenses in our existing businesses increased million  resulting from increased personnel and other processing costs incurred 
these increases are due in part to legislation imposed in certain states that have added steps to the foreclosure process and thus increased our processing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in our existing businesses increased due to an increase of million in personnel costs and health insurance costs 
amortization expense decreased primarily because of the additional million of amortization expense recorded in associated with the non compete intangible asset attributable to michael barrett  a senior officer at barrett ndex  which was fully amortized in as a result of his death in january additionally  the finalization of the purchase price allocation made in of the intangible assets associated with the barrett ndex acquisition resulted in a reduction to amortizable intangible assets  and therefore a reduction in amortization expense 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in amortization expense of million as a result of the amortizable intangible assets from our florida operations acquired in october depreciation expense increased as a result of the finalization of the purchase price allocation of barrett ndex as discussed above  which resulted in a higher amount of depreciable software 
total operating expenses attributable to our mortgage default processing services segment as a percentage of segment revenues increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  operating expenses litigation support services for the years ended december  increase s in millions total operating expenses not meaningful direct operating expense not meaningful selling  general and administrative not meaningful depreciation expense not meaningful amortization expense not meaningful total operating expenses in our litigation support services segment increased primarily as a result of the operating costs of discoverready  which we acquired in november total operating expenses attributable to our litigation support services segment as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  business information division results revenues for the years ended december  increase decrease s in millions total business information division revenues display and classified advertising revenues public notice revenues subscription and other revenues our display and classified advertising revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number of ads placed in our publications  as well as a decrease in the average price paid per classified and display ad across our publications  which we believe was driven by the continued struggling economy in several of the markets we serve  and continued apprehension on the part of our customers to return their marketing spending to previous levels 
a decrease in the number and frequency of specialty publications and magazines published also contributed to the revenue decline 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenue from our events  due to an increase in the number of events held 
our public notice revenues decreased due to an overall decrease in the total number of public notice ads placed in our publications  most of which are foreclosure notices 
approximately of this revenue decrease was driven by the decreased number of foreclosure notices placed in our maryland  missouri  and minnesota publications 
these decreases were largely due to slowdowns of public notice placements in the fourth quarter 
these revenues declined sharply in the fourth quarter as increased scrutiny made lenders more defensive about their foreclosure practices 
mounting challenges to the integrity of the industry s underlying paperwork  including the so called robo signer scandal  prompted the major banks to declare a series of voluntary foreclosure moratoriums in both judicial and non judicial foreclosure states 
foreclosure advertising is our predominant source of public notice revenue  and the temporary advertising halts were felt across nearly all of our public notice markets  including our three largest  minnesota  missouri and maryland 
throughout this time regulators were encouraging lenders to engage in more loan modifications to stave off foreclosure 
we believe these efforts have resulted in merely a delay in foreclosure notices  rather than an elimination of them 
subscription and other revenues increased as a result of the federal news service and datastream acquisitions in august and december  respectively 
the business information products we target to the missouri  minnesota  and maryland markets each accounted for just over of our business information division s revenues for the years ended december  and operating expenses for the years ended december  increase decrease s in millions total direct and selling  general and administrative expenses direct operating expense selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation expense amortization expense direct operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the federal news service and datastream acquisitions 
marketing and promotion  relating to venue  catering  and other event expenses also increased  due to an increase in the number of events held in production and distribution costs decreased  primarily due to a reduction in the pages in our print publications  as well as the printing of fewer specialty publications and magazines and related postage expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased over the prior year  most notably due to an increase in personnel expenses of million  in part due to the operating costs of the newly acquired federal news service and datastream operations 
other increases included marketing expenses to promote our newspapers and circulation efforts as well as new product initiatives begun in the first quarter of total operating expenses attributable to our business information division as a percentage of business information division revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   largely as a result of a decrease in public notice revenues  which are higher margin revenues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the years ended december  increase s in millions total revenues our mortgage default processing services revenues accounted for the majority of the increase in our revenues  all of which came from acquired businesses  primarily the million in revenues from barrett ndex 
an increase in public notice revenues of million  along with million in revenues from our fourth quarter acquisitions of discoverready and albertelli also contributed to our total increase in revenues for the period 
these increased revenues were offset by a million decline in display and classified advertising revenues in our business information division as a result of the local economic conditions in the markets we serve 
organic revenues at ndex were relatively flat year over year  which was primarily caused by mortgage lender and loan servicer responses to legislation in michigan and indiana 
we derived and of our total revenues from our professional services division and and of our total revenues from our business information division for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in our professional services division  revenues from our mortgage default processing services segment accounted for and of our total revenues in each of and  respectively 
revenues from our litigation support services segment also part of our professional services division accounted for and of our total revenues in each of and this change in mix resulted primarily from the barrett ndex acquisition in september and the albertelli and discoverready acquisitions in  as well as general economic conditions in the markets our business information products serve 
operating expenses for the years ended december  increase decrease s in millions total operating expenses direct operating expense selling  general and administrative expenses break up fee not meaningful depreciation expense amortization expense total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  direct operating expenses 
the increase in direct operating expenses consisted of a million increase in our professional services division and a million decrease in our business information division 
you should refer to the more detailed discussions in professional services division results and business information division results below for more information regarding the causes of this increase 
direct operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for  from for selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses consisted of a million increase in our professional services division  a million decrease in our business information division and a million increase in costs associated with our corporate operations as discussed below 
the increase in operating expenses attributable to our corporate operations was primarily due to an increase in unallocated corporate insurance costs million  million of which is attributable to a change we made in related to our medical self insurance reserve to more closely reflect past claims history 
in addition  in  performance based pay for our executive officers was million higher than as a result of improved operating performance 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to for  from for this is largely due to expense control efforts that were put in place in our various businesses  as well as the significant increase in revenues recorded in our professional services division in as a result of our acquisition of barrett ndex 
break up fee 
there was no break up fee paid in in  we paid million to the sellers of a business we intended to acquire  but did not 
we made this payment pursuant to our agreement with such sellers because we were unable to obtain debt financing on terms and timing that were satisfactory to us to close the acquisition 
we have not entered into such break up or termination agreements with other sellers of acquisition targets 
depreciation and amortization expense 
our depreciation expense increased due to increased levels of property and equipment in  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of barrett ndex and discoverready  as well as other capital spending as discussed in liquidity and capital resources cash from financing activities below 
our amortization expense increased primarily due to the amortization of finite life intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of barrett ndex as well as the discoverready acquisition 
additionally  in  we fully amortized that portion of the non compete intangible asset attributable to michael barrett  a senior officer at barrett ndex  as a result of his death in january this resulted in an additional million of amortization expense 
interest expense  net for the years ended december  increase decrease s in millions total interest expense  net interest on bank credit facility cash interest expense on interest rate swaps amortization of deferred financing fees other interest expense related to our bank credit facility decreased million in for  our average outstanding borrowings on our credit facility were million compared to million for however  our weighted average interest rate on those borrowings was significantly lower at december  as compared to at december   therefore resulting in lower interest expense 
cash interest incurred on our interest rate swaps increased as a result of interest rate changes 
non cash interest income expense related to interest rate swaps for the years ended december  decrease s in millions non cash interest income expense related to interest rate swaps not meaningful non cash interest expense related to interest rate swaps increased as a result of a change in the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps driven by interest rate changes in the estimated fair value of our fixed rate interest rate swaps recorded on our balance sheet changed by million  to a million liability at december   from a million liability at december  other income expense  net for the years ended december  increase s in millions other income expense  net not meaningful other income expense net increased as a result of the million gain recorded on the sale of our investment in govdelivery in  as well as the million net gain recorded related to the receipt of insurance proceeds on the company owned life insurance of michael c 
barrett  a senior officer of barrett ndex  who passed away in january income tax expense for the years ended december  increase s in millions income tax expense income tax expense increased in over primarily as a result of significantly higher income recorded in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of barrett ndex 
income tax expense for  as a percentage of income before income taxes  was compared to for this was calculated including the income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in ndex and discoverready 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from resulted primarily from the receipt of non taxable life insurance proceeds paid in on the death of michael barrett  a senior officer at ndex 
because ndex and discoverready our subsidiaries with a noncontrolling interest operate as partnerships  their respective income before income taxes is not subject to federal taxation at the entity level 
this results in an effective tax rate for that is lower than the effective tax rate that we would compute for the dolan company  excluding income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 
for year over year comparison purposes  we have provided the effective tax rate computed for the dolan company  excluding income attributable to the noncontrolling interest  which was for and for professional services division results revenues for the years ended december  increase s in millions total professional services division revenues mortgage default processing service segment revenues litigation support services segment revenues professional services division revenues increased primarily due to the increase in mortgage default processing service segment revenues 
barrett ndex and the albertelli acquisition added million and million in revenues  respectively  in this increase was partially offset by a decline in mortgage default processing service segment revenues resulting from new legislation in michigan and indiana that took effect in july while the michigan legislation did not adversely impact the number of files sent to us for processing during the year when compared to  it did lengthen the time over which we recognize revenue from these files because it added steps to the foreclosure process 
the indiana legislation negatively impacted the files we processed for our indiana law firm customer and corresponding revenue when compared to  because it delays the start of a foreclosure action  and thus the time when a file is sent to us for processing for a period of at least days 
for the year ended december   we processed approximately  mortgage default case files compared to approximately  mortgage default case files that we processed for the year ended december  barrett ndex accounted for approximately  or  of the files we processed in barrett ndex s total file volume for was  which includes  files processed during the months that we owned them 
the barrett law firm and trott trott each accounted for more than  and together accounted for approximately and of our mortgage default processing services segment and professional services division revenues in  respectively 
for the same period in  trott trott  feiwell hannoy  and the barrett law firm each accounted for more than of our mortgage default processing services segment and professional services division revenues 
litigation support services revenues increased million in  resulting from the acquisition of discoverready in november and our entry into the discovery management and document review services line of business 
operating expenses mortgage default processing services for the years ended december  increase s in millions total operating expenses direct operating expense selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation expense amortization expense total operating expenses in this segment increased primarily as a result of the operating costs of barrett ndex  which we acquired in september this added million in operating expenses and accounted for million of the increase in direct operating expenses  and million of the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
segment operating expenses exclusive of the effects of the barrett ndex acquisition increased slightly over the prior year period due primarily to increased personnel and health insurance costs 
amortization expense increased from the amortization of finite life intangible assets associated with the acquisition of barrett ndex  which added million in amortization expense 
depreciation expense also increased as a result of the addition of the barrett ndex assets 
total operating expenses attributable to our mortgage default processing services segment as a percentage of segment revenues increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  operating expenses litigation support services for the years ended december  increase s in millions total operating expenses direct operating expense selling  general and administrative depreciation expense amortization expense total operating expenses in our litigation support services segment increased primarily as a result of the operating costs of discoverready  which we acquired in november counsel press direct and selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat in as compared to amortization expense increased from the amortization of finite life intangible assets associated with the acquisition of discoverready 
total operating expenses attributable to our litigation support services segment as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  business information division results revenues for the years ended december  increase decrease s in millions total business information division revenues display and classified advertising revenues public notice revenues subscription and other revenues our display and classified advertising revenues which include revenues from events decreased primarily due to an approximate decrease in the number of ads placed in our publications  which we believe was driven by the sluggish economy  as well as a decrease in the average price paid per classified and display ad across our publications 
a decrease in the number and frequency of specialty publications and magazines published also contributed to the revenue decline 
our public notice revenues increased due to an approximate increase in the total number of public notice ads placed in our publications  most of which are foreclosure notices 
foreclosure notices tend to be larger ads  which we are generally required to publish multiple times and thus they generate more revenue than other types of public notice 
approximately of this revenue increase was driven by the increased number of foreclosure notices placed in our maryland publication 
in  a change in public notice laws in maryland delayed the timing of when foreclosure notices were placed in this publication 
subscription and other revenues decreased due primarily to a decline in the number of paid subscribers between december  and december  as of december   our paid publications had approximately  subscribers  a decrease of approximately  or  from total paid subscribers of approximately  as of december  the majority of this decrease in paid subscriptions over these periods resulted from fewer responses to new subscription campaigns and non renewals of discounted bulk subscriptions at several law firms  which we believe is a result of a sluggish economy 
we believe reader preference for online and web site access to our business journals  some of which we have offered at discounted rates or no fee  has also contributed to a decline in circulation and other revenues 
revenues lost from this decline in paid subscriptions were partially offset by an increase in the average price per paid subscription 
the business information products we target to the missouri  minnesota  and maryland markets each accounted for just over of our business information division s revenues for the year ended december  and for the same period in  the business information products we target to the missouri and minnesota markets each accounted for just over of our business information division s revenues 
operating expenses for the years ended december  increase decrease s in millions total direct and selling  general and administrative expenses direct operating expense selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation expense amortization expense direct operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of decreased production and distribution costs 
these costs declined by million primarily due to a reduction in the pages in our print publications  as well as the printing of fewer specialty publications and magazines and negotiating contract price reductions with our primary printing vendors 
business units also reduced their contract labor and freelance expenses as they relied more on in house staff  thereby reducing direct operating expenses by million 
in addition  decreased headcount and lower commissions and performance based pay  which resulted from lower display and classified advertising revenue  accounted for another million of the decrease 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined primarily as a result of a reduction in personnel expenses  relating to a reduced headcount and lower commission and performance based payments million 
a million reduction in bad debt expense as a result of more focused collection efforts also contributed to this decrease 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in promotional spending as we maintain and build our brands in several of the markets we serve 
total operating expenses attributable to our business information division as a percentage of business information division revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   largely as a result of an increase in public notice revenues  which are higher margin revenues  and cost control efforts we implemented during off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  available capacity under our credit facility  distributions received from dlnp  and available cash reserves 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents  working capital deficit and long term debt  less current portion as of december  and  as well as cash flows for the years ended december   and in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents working capital deficit long term debt  less current portion years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities acquisitions and investments capital expenditures net cash used provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities the most significant inflows of cash are cash receipts from our customers 
operating cash outflows include payments to employees  payments to vendors for services and supplies and payments of interest and income taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this was primarily a result of an increase in distributions from dlnp of million and a decrease in distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interest of million 
distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interest decreased largely because of the reduction of the noncontrolling interest percentage in ndex as discussed above in noncontrolling interest 
changes in cash flows from our various operating assets and liabilities were relatively consistent  in the aggregate  with  with the exception being the prepayment of federal and state income taxes as of december  at december   we had prepaid million of federal and state income taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of improved net income  largely as a result of the acquired business of barrett ndex in september working capital increased million  to million at december   from a deficit of million at december   resulting primarily from decreases in the current portion of our long term debt  due to a modification of our long term debt agreement on december   which caused a million increase in working capital 
also contributing to the increase in working capital  at december   we had million of prepaid income taxes on our balance sheet compared to a payable balance of million a year ago 
we also had a million positive impact on working capital pertaining to the net change in accounts receivable  unbilled pass through costs  and accrued pass through liabilities resulting from improved cash collections and the timing of the payment of pass through liabilities and the subsequent billing of those costs to our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables and days sales outstanding  or dso  as of december   and is set forth in the table below december  allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable days sales outstanding our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable increased slightly in the decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts in as a percentage of gross accounts receivable was primarily a result of the addition of receivables from the barrett law firm for which no allowance for doubtful accounts is carried 
no allowance is carried on this account because  to date  we have not experienced any problems with respect to collecting payment from the barrett law firm 
additionally  focused collection efforts across our business information operating units resulted in a decrease in the estimated reserves 
we calculate dso by dividing net receivables by average daily revenue excluding circulation 
average daily revenue is computed by dividing total revenue by the total number of days in the period 
our dso s increased in due in part to longer collection cycles at discoverready and also due to discoverready s overall growth as a larger part of our company

finite life intangible assets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the change in finite life intangible assets resulted primarily from the assets in the federal news and datastream acquisitions 
see recent acquisitions  above for a discussion of these acquisitions 
finite life intangible assets decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the change in the finite life intangible assets resulted primarily from the completion of the valuation of the assets acquired in the barrett ndex acquisition and the reclassification of amounts previously recorded as finite life intangible assets 
these assets  which were originally recorded in connection with the barrett ndex acquisition  were changed in connection with the completion of the valuation of the acquired assets in the third quarter of partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in finite life intangible assets as a result of the albertelli and discoverready acquisitions  adding million and million  respectively  in finite life intangible assets in indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill  increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this change resulted from the preliminary valuation of the assets acquired in the datastream acquisition which added million of indefinite lived intangible assets  as well as the completion of the valuation of the assets acquired in the discoverready acquisition which reduced indefinite lived intangible assets by million as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

credit agreement 
on december   we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement  effective december  the new credit agreement  with a syndicate of bank lenders for a million senior secured credit facility comprised of a term loan facility in an initial aggregate amount of million due and payable in quarterly installments with a final maturity date of december  and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to million  which may be increased pursuant to an accordion feature to up to million  with a final maturity date of december  at any time after december   if the outstanding principal balance of revolving loans under the revolving credit facility of the new credit agreement exceeds million  million of such revolving loans shall convert to an amortizing term loan due and payable in quarterly installments with a final maturity date of december  the new credit agreement restated our previous credit agreement in its entirety 
in connection with this new credit facility  we paid approximately million in bank and legal fees 
in  we drew an aggregate million  net  of revolving loans to fund the acquisition of businesses we acquired in  including barrett ndex  and for general working capital purposes 
in  we converted million of these revolving loans  which included the opening balance of million plus net new borrowings of million  to term loans in accordance with the terms of our then existing credit facility 
in  we drew an aggregate million  net  of revolving loans to fund the acquisition of businesses we acquired in  along with other payments due to the sellers of businesses we acquired in  and for general working capital purposes 
in the first quarter of  we paid down the million balance on the revolver 
in december  we drew million on the revolver under the new credit agreement  which we used in part to pay off the previous term loan 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our term loan  and million outstanding under our revolving variable rate notes and available capacity of approximately million  after taking into account the senior leverage ratio requirements under the credit agreement 
we expect to use the remaining availability under our credit facility  if needed  for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including the financing of other acquisitions 
our new credit agreement permits us to elect whether outstanding amounts under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility accrue interest based on a base rate or a eurocurrency rate specifically  libor as determined in accordance with the new credit agreement  in each case  plus a margin that fluctuates on the basis of the ratio of our total liabilities to pro forma ebitda 
the margin on the base rate loans may fluctuate between and and the margin on the eurocurrency rate loans may fluctuate between and 
if we elect to have interest accrue i based on the base rate  then such interest is due and payable on the first business day of each month and ii based on a eurocurrency rate  then such interest is due and payable at the end of the applicable interest period that we have elected  provided that if the applicable interest period is longer than three months  interest will be due and payable in three month intervals 
at december   the combined weighted average interest rate on our senior term note and revolver was 
our obligations are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of such entities  including pledges of equity interests in the consolidated subsidiaries 
the new credit agreement contains provisions for the issuance of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
it also permits us to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders as well as establish a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase shares of our stock  subject to a debt leverage ratio requirement 
in addition  our new credit agreement contains a number of negative covenants that  unless consents are received  limit us from  among other things and with certain thresholds and exceptions incurring indebtedness including guarantee obligations or liens  entering into mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  selling assets  entering into certain acquisition transactions  forming or entering into partnerships and joint ventures  entering into negative pledge agreements  entering into transactions with affiliates  making investments  entering into sale and leaseback transactions  and changing our line s of business 
the new credit agreement requires that  as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  we and our consolidated subsidiaries not permit our total cash flow leverage ratio to be more than to or to following an acquisition triggering event  fixed charge coverage ratio to be less than to  and adjusted ebitda for the previous two fiscal quarters to be less than million  which amount may increase up to million upon increase of the revolving credit facility pursuant to the accordion feature 
this total cash flow leverage ratio represents  for any particular date  the ratio of our outstanding indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of million to our pro forma ebitda  calculated in accordance with our new credit agreement  for the four fiscal quarters ended on  or most recently ended before  the applicable date 
our fixed charge coverage ratio  for any particular date  is equal to the ratio of our adjusted ebitda  calculated in accordance with our new credit agreement less income taxes paid in cash  net capital expenditures paid in cash  and certain restricted payments paid in cash  to interest expense plus scheduled principal payments on account of the term loan facility and our interest bearing liabilities plus all payments made pursuant to non competition or consulting fees paid by us in connection with acquisitions plus dividends paid  for the four fiscal quarters ended on  or most recently ended before  the applicable date 
if we are required to take an impairment charge to our goodwill in the future  we do not expect that charge to impact our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our new credit agreement because impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of ebitda for purposes of meeting the fixed coverage and senior leverage ratios and because there is no net worth minimum covenant in such agreement 
future needs we expect that cash flow from operations  supplemented by short and long term financing and the proceeds from our credit facility  as necessary  will be adequate to fund day to day operations and capital expenditure requirements  along with our payment obligations to the trott sellers in connection with our purchase of their ownership interest in ndex and to feiwell hannoy in connection with the exercise of its put right  both as described in recent developments increase in our ownership in ndex 
however  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future could be adversely impacted by regulatory  lender and other responses to the mortgage crisis  including new and proposed legislation and lenders voluntary and required loss mitigation efforts and moratoria  including those described in recent developments regulatory environment earlier in this annual report 
a decision to repurchase shares of our common stock as permitted under our stock repurchase program may impact our cash needs in the future 
this program was approved by our board of directors in december  and in the first quarter of we repurchased  shares under this program for an aggregate of million 
see recent developments stock buy back plan earlier in this annual report on form k for a discussion of this plan 
we plan to continue to develop and evaluate potential acquisitions to expand our product and service offerings and customer base and enter new geographic markets 
we intend to fund these acquisitions over the next twelve months with funds generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
we may also need to raise money to fund these acquisitions  as we did for the acquisition of barrett ndex in  through the sale of our equity securities or additional debt financing  including takedowns under our million shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec on january  our ability to secure short term and long term financing in the future will depend on several factors  including our future profitability and cash flow from operations  the quality of our short and long term assets  our relative levels of debt and equity  the financial condition and operations of acquisition targets in the case of acquisition financing and the overall condition of the credit markets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under our credit facility 
however  as of december   we had two swap arrangements that convert million of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
the aggregate notional amount of the swap agreements was million  of which million will mature on march   and the balance of the million notional swap will mature on various dates through june  we enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we record the fair value of our swap agreements in accrued liabilities or other liabilities on our balance sheet  depending on the timing of the expiration of the swap agreement 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument  like our interest rate swap agreements  depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
as of december   we have designated only the interest rate swap agreement that terminates on june   for hedge accounting treatment 
accordingly  we record changes in the fair value of this swap agreement in other comprehensive income or loss net of tax on our balance sheet for the period then ended 
conversely  we treat the fair value of the swap agreement that terminates on march   and does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  as a component of interest income expense in our statement of operations for the period then ended 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized interest income of million and million  respectively  related to the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement that does not qualify for hedge accounting 
at december   we have million net of tax included in other comprehensive loss related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement that terminates on june   and does qualify for hedge accounting 
we did not record other comprehensive income for the year ended december   because we did not have an interest rate swap agreement in effect at the end of that period which qualified  and was designated  for hedge accounting treatment 
at december  and  the estimated fair value of our fixed interest rate swaps was a liability of million and million  respectively 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease 
based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio  a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of million pre tax  million pre tax  and million pre tax in the years ended december   and  respectively
