overview we are an international business process outsourcing provider of end to end ecommerce solutions 
we provide these solutions to major brand name companies seeking to optimize their supply chain and to enhance their traditional and online business channels and initiatives 
we derive our revenues from providing a broad range of services as we process individual business transactions on our clients behalf using three different seller services financial models the enablement model  the agent or flash model and the retail model 
we refer to the standard pfsweb seller services financial model as the enablement model 
in this model  our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various business outsourcing services in support of their business operations 
we derive our service fee revenues from a broad range of service offerings that include digital marketing  ecommerce technologies  order management  customer care  logistics and fulfillment  financial management and professional consulting 
we offer our services as an integrated solution  which enables our clients to outsource their complete infrastructure needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies 
our distribution services are conducted at warehouses we lease or manage 
we currently provide infrastructure and distribution solutions to clients that operate in a range of vertical markets  including technology manufacturing  computer products  cosmetics  fragile goods  contemporary home furnishings  apparel  aviation  telecommunications  consumer electronics and consumer packaged goods  among others 
in this model  we typically charge for our services on a cost plus basis  a percent of shipped revenue basis or a per transaction basis  such as a per minute basis for web enabled customer contact center services and a per item basis for fulfillment services 
additional fees are billed for other services 
we price our services based on a variety of factors  including the depth and complexity of the services provided  the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required  the length of contract and other factors 
many of our service fee contracts involve third party vendors who provide additional services such as package delivery 
the costs we are charged by these third party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients 
our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other out of pocket expenses include travel  shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass through revenue 
as an additional service  we offer our second model  the agent  or flash  financial model  in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations as in the enablement model 
when a customer orders the product from our clients  a flash sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we  in turn  immediately re sell the product to the customer 
the flash ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record  which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers  removing the need for the clients to establish these business processes internally  but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers 
in this model  we record product revenue either on a gross or net basis depending on the underlying contract terms 
finally  our retail model allows us to purchase inventory from the client just as any other client reseller partner 
in this model  we place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product upon delivery to our facility 
consequently  in this model  we generate product revenue as we own the inventory and the accounts receivable arising from our product sales 
under the retail model  depending upon the product category and sales characteristics  we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms  right of return  and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile 
in this model we recognize product revenue for customer sales 
freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue 
this business model requires significant working capital requirements  for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our client or under senior credit facilities 
in general  we provide the enablement model through our pfs and supplies distributors subsidiaries  the agent or flash model through our pfs and supplies distributors subsidiaries and the retail model through our supplies distributors subsidiaries and our pfsweb retail connect subsidiary formerly ecost

table of contents growth is a key element to achieving our future goals  including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability 
growth in our enablement and agent models is driven by two main elements new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients 
we focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand name companies within two primary target markets  online brands and retailers and technology manufacturers  which  by nature  require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements 
growth within our retail model currently is primarily driven by our ability to attract new master distributor arrangements with ips or other manufacturers and the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners 
we continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability 
while we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield increased gross profit  we also expect to incur incremental investments to implement new contracts  investments in infrastructure and sales and marketing to support our targeted growth and increased public company professional fees 
our expenses comprise primarily four categories cost of product revenue  cost of service fee revenue  cost of pass through revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of product revenue consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs  which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses 
these reimbursable expenses include pass through customer marketing programs  direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids  the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the master distributor agreements 
cost of service fee revenue consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web enabled customer contact center services  international fulfillment and distribution services and professional consulting services  and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
cost of pass through revenue the related reimbursable costs for pass through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass through revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff  distribution costs excluding freight applicable to the supplies distributors business and the retail model  executive  management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
monitoring and controlling our available cash balances and our expenses continues to be a primary focus 
our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth 
to aid this  in may  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock that provided net proceeds of million

product revenue  net 
product revenue of million decreased million  or in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased sales volumes as a result of reduced ibm and ips printer installations in certain categories as well as temporary inventory supply shortages resulting from our largest supplier in this segment transitioning to a new systems platform in and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared to the same period in the prior year 
we currently expect our total annual product revenue to remain relatively stable as compared to levels 
service fee revenue 
the increase in service fee revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to the growth in existing clients as well as new client relationships that were added during and  
table of contents including incremental project work  partially offset by the non renewal of certain service contract relationships  including the non renewal of a us government agency client relationship  which ended in early the change in service fee revenue  excluding pass through revenue  is shown below millions year ended december  new service contract relationships change in existing client service fees including clients implemented during terminated clients not included in revenue year ended december  the service fee revenue for includes approximately million of revenue generated from clients who terminated their contractual relationships with the company during however  based on historical activity and current projection of existing clients  including new clients signed in  net of the impact from the non renewal of certain clients  we currently anticipate that service fee revenue will increase from service fee revenue levels 
cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue decreased by million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of decreased product sales 
the resulting gross profit margin was million or of product revenue for the year ended december  and million or of product revenue for the gross profit margin for and includes the impact of certain incremental gross margins earned on product sales  however  the impact of these amounts was higher in the period and is not expected to continue at that same rate 
cost of service fee revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of service fees was in and in the period includes the margin impact of new client relationships that began in late and throughout the margins include the benefit of higher margin incremental project work associated with a us government contract relationship that was not renewed and was completed in the second quarter of we target to earn an overall gross profit of on existing and new service fee contracts  but we have and may continue to accept lower gross margin percentages on certain contracts depending on contract scope and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of total net revenues in the period and million  or of total net revenues in the prior year 
the period includes the impact of certain executive disability benefit costs as well as distribution facility relocation expenses that did not occur in these incremental expenses were more than offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization  information technology services and personnel related expenses 
income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision associated primarily with state income taxes and our subsidiary supplies distributors canadian and european operations as well as our philippines operation 
a valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our net deferred tax assets  which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we expect that we will continue to record an income tax provision associated with state income taxes and supplies distributors canadian and european results of operations 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
discontinued operations generated a loss of approximately million in and income of approximately million in in february  we sold substantially all of the inventory and certain intangible assets applicable to our ecost 
com business unit for a total aggregate cash purchase price of approximately million 
for both and  we have classified the operating results of this business unit  excluding costs expected to continue to occur in the future  as discontinued operations 
a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million is included in the loss from discontinued operations 

table of contents supplies distributors and its subsidiaries we conduct a portion of our retail model business services through supplies distributors and its subsidiaries  which act as master distributors of various ips and other products 
we conduct a portion of our retail model business services through transaction management services agreement under which pfs provides transaction management and fulfillment services to supplies distributors and its subsidiaries 
in addition to our equity investment in supplies distributors  we have also provided supplies distributors with a subordinated loan that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of million 
supplies distributors paid us dividends of million and million in and  respectively 
supplies distributors has received lender approval to pay dividends of approximately million in  and to reduce its subordinated debt to us by million  but pursuant to the terms of its amended credit agreements  is restricted from paying further cash dividends without the prior approval of its lenders 
in addition  no distribution may be made if  after giving effect thereto  supplies distributors or its subsidiaries be in noncompliance with its financial covenants under its current facilities 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  and primarily resulted from cash income from continuing operations before working capital changes of million and an increase in accounts payable  deferred revenue  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million and an increase in prepaid expenses  other receivables and other assets of million 
net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was million in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  and primarily resulted from a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and cash income from continuing operations before working capital changes of million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable  deferred revenue  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was million in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively  resulting from capital expenditures 
capital expenditures have historically consisted primarily of additions to upgrade our management information systems  development of customized technology solutions to support and integrate with our service fee clients and general expansion and upgrades to our facilities  both domestic and foreign 
we expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities 
based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans  we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology services for the upcoming twelve months  including costs to implement new clients  will be approximately million to million  although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients 
to maintain our current operating cash position  a portion of these expenditures may be financed through client reimbursements  debt  operating or capital leases or additional equity 
we may elect to modify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not obtain the financing or achieve the financial results necessary to support such investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  primarily representing net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock pursuant to a public offering offset by payments on debt and capital leases 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   primarily representing payments on debt and capital leases 
during the year ended december   our working capital increased to million from million at december   primarily due to net proceeds from an equity offering in may partially offset by the pay 
table of contents down of debt facilities along with the impact of certain technology and development costs incurred during that were prepaid by certain clients in to obtain additional financing in the future  in addition to our current cash position  we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity  utilizing capital or operating leases  borrowing under our credit facilities  expanding our current credit facilities  entering into new debt agreements or transferring to third parties a portion of our subordinated loan balance due from supplies distributors 
in conjunction with certain of these alternatives  we may be required to provide certain letters of credit to secure these arrangements 
no assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof 
we currently believe our cash position  financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  our current debt and lease obligations  and additional loans to our subsidiaries  if necessary  for at least the next twelve months 
during the past few years  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and foreign governments 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to renew our credit facilities 
in support of certain debt instruments and leases  as of december   we had million of cash restricted for repayment to lenders 
in addition  as described above  we have provided collateralized guarantees to secure the repayment of certain of our subsidiaries credit facilities 
many of these facilities include both financial and non financial covenants  and also include cross default provisions applicable to other credit facilities and agreements 
these covenants include minimum levels of net worth for the individual borrower subsidiaries and the restrictions on the ability of the borrower subsidiaries to advance funds to other borrower subsidiaries 
as a result  it is possible for one or more of these borrower subsidiaries to fail to meet their respective covenants even if another borrower subsidiary otherwise has available excess funds which  if not restricted  could be used to cure the default 
to the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants  including the monthly financial covenant requirements and our required level of shareholders equity  and the lenders accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations  we would be required to repay all amounts outstanding thereunder 
in particular  if pfs service fee revenue declines from expected levels and it is unable to reduce costs to correspond to such reduced revenue levels or if supplies distributors revenue or gross profit declines from expected levels  such events may result in a breach of one or more of the financial covenants required under their working capital lines of credit 
in such event  absent a waiver  the working capital lender would be entitled to accelerate all amounts outstanding thereunder and exercise all other rights and remedies  including sale of collateral and payment under our parent guaranty 
a requirement to accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all of such obligations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
further  any non renewal of any of our credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
we do not have any other material financial commitments  although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients 
in the future  we may attempt to acquire other businesses or seek an equity or strategic partner to generate capital or expand our services or capabilities in connection with our efforts to grow our business 
acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties and may require additional financing 
therefore  we can give no assurance with respect to whether we will be successful in identifying businesses to acquire or an equity or strategic partner  whether we or they will be able to obtain financing to complete a transaction  or whether we or they will be successful in operating the acquired business 
we receive municipal tax abatements in certain locations 
during we received notice from a municipality that we did not satisfy certain criteria necessary to maintain the abatements 
in december we received notice that the municipal authority planned to make an adjustment to our tax abatement 
we disputed the adjustment and such dispute has been settled with the municipality 
however  the amount of additional property taxes to be assessed against us and the timing of the related payments has not been finalized 
as of december   we believe we have adequately accrued for the expected assessment

to reduce the risk of loss due to supplier price reductions  supplies distributors master distributor agreement provides for price protection under which it receives credits if the supplier lowers prices on previously purchased inventory 
seasonality the seasonality of our service fee business is dependent upon the seasonality of our clients business and sales of their products 
accordingly  we must rely upon the projections of our clients in assessing quarterly variability 
we believe that with our current client mix and their current business volumes  our run rate service fee business activity will be at its lowest in the quarter ended march and highest in the quarter ended december we anticipate our product revenue will be highest during the quarter ended december we believe our historical revenue pattern makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations 
we believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force to amend certain guidance in fasb accounting standards codification tm asc  revenue recognition   multiple element arrangements 
the amended guidance in asc modifies the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered item s  and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and instead requires that arrangement consideration be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the fasb also issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  to amend the scope of arrangements under asc  software   revenue recognition to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
the amended guidance in asc and asc is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early application and retrospective application permitted 
the amendments to asc and asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it would likely result in a material adverse impact to our business  operating results and financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
table of contents about matters that are uncertain 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 
product revenue recognition sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances which are estimated based upon historical return information 
management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates 
if actual sales returns  allowances and discounts are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
cost of service fee revenue our service fee revenue primarily relates to our distribution services and order management customer care services 
distribution services relate primarily to inventory management  product receiving  warehousing and fulfillment ie  picking  packing and shipping product on our clients behalf 
order management customer care services relate primarily to taking customer orders for our clients products via various channels such as telephone call center  electronic or facsimile 
these services also entail addressing customer questions related to orders  as well as cross selling up selling activities 
our cost of service fee revenue represents the cost to provide the services described above  primarily compensation and related expenses and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing the services 
these include certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
certain of these costs are allocated from general and administrative expenses 
for these allocations  we estimate the amount of direct expenses based on client specific information  such as the number of transactions processed 
we believe our allocation methodology is reasonable  however a change in assumptions would result in a different gross profit in our statement of operations  yet no change to the resulting net income or loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate 
inherently  these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future 
in our retail model  we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables  which arise from inventory returns to vendors  vendor rebates  price protections and other promotions 
we determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors  including payment history 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non compliance with certain elements of vendor programs 
if our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient  additional allowance maybe required 
allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 

table of contents inventory reserves inventories merchandise  held for resale  all of which are finished goods are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
supplies distributors and its subsidiaries assume responsibility for slow moving inventory under certain master distributor agreements  subject to certain termination rights  but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes  as defined 
we review inventories for impairment on a periodic basis  but at a minimum  annually 
recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparisons of the carrying value to the fair value of the inventory 
this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
if write downs of inventories are necessary  the cost basis of that inventory is adjusted 
to determine these reserve amounts  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions 
these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes 
at december  and  our allowance for slow moving inventory was million and million  respectively 
we believe our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions 
significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ  which could be material 
as we operate in multiple countries  we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year
