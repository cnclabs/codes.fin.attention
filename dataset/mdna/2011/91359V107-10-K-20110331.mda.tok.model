critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s primary areas of estimate are described below 
recognition of premium revenues 
property and liability premiums are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the policy term 
the portion of premiums that will be earned in the future are deferred and reported as unearned premiums 
the company believes that its revenue recognition policies conform to staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
insurance liabilities 
reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying losses and lae under insurance policies upcic has issued 
underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of losses and lae reserves 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves 
reserves are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported 
upcic s claim settlement data suggests that homeowners property losses have an average settlement time of less than one year  while homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle 
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update reserve estimates quarterly as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve re estimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated 
table of contents estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as losses and lae in the consolidated statements of income in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of losses and lae is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates 
reserves for losses and lae are determined in three separate steps 
these steps are the estimation of reserves for non catastrophe loss and defense and cost containment dcc expenses hereafter referred to simply as losses  estimation of reserves for hurricane experience  and estimation of reserves for adjusting and other ao expenses 
these three steps are further separated into the analysis of data groupings of like exposure 
these groups are property damage on homeowner policy forms ho and ho combined  property damage on homeowner policy forms ho and ho combined  dwelling fire property damage  all homeowner liability exposure  other liability the optional liability coverage offered to dwelling fire policyholders  and all hurricane experience combined 
reserve estimates for non catastrophe losses are derived using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
that actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
this technique forms the basis of the six actuarial methods described below 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred  regardless of the date it was reported to upcic 
this analysis is used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key data elements used to determine our reserve estimates include claim counts  paid losses  paid dcc  case reserves  and the related development factors applicable to this data 
the first method for estimating unpaid amounts for non hurricane losses is the reported development method 
this method is based upon the assumption that the relative change in a given year s reported loss estimates from one evaluation point to the next is similar to the relative change in prior years reported loss estimates at similar evaluation points 
in utilizing this method  actual annual historical reported loss data is evaluated 
successive years can be arranged to form a triangle of data 
report to report rtr development factors are calculated to measure the change in cumulative reported losses from one evaluation point to the next 
these historical rtr factors form the basis for selecting the rtr factors used in projecting the current valuation of losses to an ultimate basis 
in addition  a tail factor is selected to account for loss development beyond the observed experience 
the tail factor is based on trends shown in the data and consideration of industry loss development benchmarks 
this method s implicit assumption is that the relative adequacy of case reserves has been consistent over time  and that there have been no material changes in the rate at which claims have been reported 
the second method is the paid development method 
this method is similar to the reported development method  however  case reserves are excluded from the analysis 
while this method has the disadvantage of not recognizing the information provided by current case reserves  it has the advantage of avoiding potential distortions in the data due to changes in case reserving methodology 
this method s implicit assumption is that the rate of payment of claims has been relatively consistent over time 
the third method is the reported bornhuetter ferguson b f method 
this method is essentially a blend of two other methods 
the first method is the loss development method described above  whereby actual reported losses are multiplied by an expected loss development factor 
for slow reporting coverages  the loss development method can lead to erratic and unreliable projections  because a relatively small swing in early reporting periods can result in a large swing in ultimate projections 
the second method is the expected loss method a description of the expected loss method follows the description of the reported b f method  whereby the ibnr estimate equals the difference between a predetermined estimate of expected losses and actual reported losses 
this has the advantage of stability  but it does not respond to actual results as they emerge 
the reported b f method combines these two methods by setting ultimate losses equal to actual reported losses plus expected unreported losses 
as an experience year matures and expected unreported losses become smaller  the initial expected loss assumption becomes gradually less important 
two parameters are needed to apply the b f method the initial expected loss ratio and the expected reporting pattern 
the initial expected loss ratio for each accident year other than the current year is set equal to the estimated ultimate loss ratio from the prior analysis 
the initial expected loss ratio for the current year is determined based on trends in historical ratios  rate changes  and underlying loss trends 
the expected reporting pattern is based on the reported loss development method described above 
this method is often used for long tail lines and in situations where the reported loss experience is relatively immature or lacks sufficient credibility for the application of other methods 
as mentioned above  one component of the b f method is the expected loss method 
in this method  ultimate loss projections are based upon some prior measure of the anticipated losses  usually relative to some measure of 
table of contents exposure  such as premiums  revenues  or payroll 
an expected loss ratio or loss cost pure premium is applied to the measure of exposure to determine estimated ultimate losses for each year 
actual losses are not considered in this calculation 
this method has the advantage of stability over time because the ultimate loss estimates do not change unless the exposures or pure premiums change 
however  this advantage of stability is offset by a lack of responsiveness  since this method does not consider actual loss experience as it emerges 
this method is based on the assumption that the pure premium per unit of exposure is a good indication of ultimate losses 
it is entirely dependent on pricing assumptions 
the fourth method is the paid b f method 
this method is analogous to the reported b f method using paid losses and development patterns in place of reported losses and patterns 
the fifth method is the reported counts and averages method 
in this method  an estimate of unpaid losses is determined by separately projecting ultimate reported claim counts and ultimate reported claim severities cost per reported claim for each accident period 
typically  loss development methods are used to project ultimate claim counts and claim severities based on historical data using the same methodology described in the reported development method above 
estimated ultimate losses are then calculated as the product of the two items 
this method is intended to avoid data distortions that may exist with the other methods for the most recent years as a result of changes in case reserve levels  settlement rates  etc 
in addition  it may provide insight into the drivers of loss experience 
the sixth method is the paid counts and averages method 
this method is analogous to the reported counts and averages method using paid claims counts and paid claim severities and their related development patterns in place of reported data 
in selecting the rtr development factors described above  due consideration is given to how the rtr development factors change from one year to the next over the course of several consecutive years of recent history 
in addition to the loss development triangles cited above  various diagnostic triangles  such as triangles showing historical patterns in the ratio of paid to reported losses and paid to reported claim counts are typically prepared as a means of determining the stability of various determinants of loss development  such as consistency in claims settlement and case reserving 
the implicit assumption of these techniques is that the selected rtr factors combine to form loss development patterns that are predictive of future loss development 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that the selected development factors includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  an unusually large amount of catastrophe losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
the six methods described above all produce an estimate of ultimate losses 
based on the results of these six methods  a single estimate commonly referred to as a actuarial point central estimate of the ultimate loss is selected 
estimated ibnr reserves are determined by subtracting the reported loss from the selected ultimate loss 
the estimated ibnr reserves are added to case reserves to determine the total estimated unpaid losses 
estimates of unpaid losses for hurricane experience are not developed using company specific development patterns  due to the relatively infrequent nature of storms and the high severity typically associated with them 
both the reported development method and the paid development method were used to estimate ultimate losses 
however  the development patterns were based on industry data determined by our consulting actuary 
there is an inherent assumption that relying on industry development patterns as opposed to company specific patterns produces more credible results for projecting hurricane losses 
estimated unpaid amounts for non catastrophe ao expenses are determined as the product of the estimated number of outstanding claims whether open or unreported times an estimate of average ao per claim 
universal s claims are handled by universal adjusting corporation uac  a wholly owned subsidiary 
uac is compensated based on a fee schedule as follows 
table of contents cost of repair adjusting fee to   to   to   to   to   to  in cases where a claim exceeds  uac is compensated on a time and expense basis based on the following fee schedule category fee non clerical hour clerical hour mileage mile photographs each uac is compensated at the time a claim is closed whether with or without payment 
the procedure we followed was to begin by developing a history of average ao expenses per closed claim whether with or without payment for each line of business 
since average fees have increased dramatically in the last two years  we placed reliance primarily on the indications from those two years in making our selections 
the selected average ao expense was then multiplied by the estimated number of claims to be closed in the future whether with or without payment to determine an estimated liability 
the estimated number of claims to be closed in the future was determined by projecting reported claims for each accident year to an estimated ultimate basis using the traditional development factor method  then subtracting the total number of claims that have closed as of december  whether with or without payment 
in the case of the ao liabilities associated with hurricane exposure  a similar procedure was used to determine an estimate of the average ao expense per closed claim as was used for the non catastrophe ao liabilities 
however  a different procedure was used to estimate the number of claims to be closed in the future since the reported claim count development method would not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate hurricane claims 
three separate estimates of outstanding claims were determined 
in one method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where claim severity was estimated as the ratio of paid losses to closed claims 
in the second method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where estimated claim severity was determined as the ratio of reported losses to reported claims 
in the third method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where claim severity was determined as the ratio of case reserves to open claims 
based on these three methods a final selection was made on estimated outstanding claim counts 
the final selection is multiplied by estimated average ao expense per claim to derive the estimated liability 
how reserve estimates are established and updated 
reserve estimates are developed for both open claims and ibnr claims 
the actuarial methods described above are used to derive claim settlement patterns by determining development factors to be applied to specific data elements 
development factors are calculated for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled  paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents reserves are re estimated quarterly  by combining historical results with current actual results 
this process incorporates the historic and latest trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
when actual development of claims reported  paid losses or case reserve changes are different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves the previous estimate is the amount of reserve re estimate and an increase or decrease in losses and lae will be recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
total reserve re estimates  after tax  as a percent of net income  in  and were   and  respectively  which are consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our business reserve re estimates were primarily the result of actual loss development on prior year non catastrophe losses during the years ending december  and  and from higher than expected hurricane losses and actual loss development on prior year non catastrophe losses during the year ended december  reserve re estimates on non catastrophe losses  which have been well within acceptable ranges  are a result of settling homeowner s losses established in the prior year for amounts that were more than expected 
these reserve re estimates were primarily the result of claim severity development that was worse than expected and late reported loss development that was worse than expected due to higher frequency trends 
these trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry  which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage and litigation 
these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of the reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on indications of updated development factor calculations 
reserve re estimates for catastrophe losses  which are associated with the high level of uncertainty related to hurricane claims are described under catastrophe losses below 
factors affecting reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously described 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  differing payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to property  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and an initial case reserve of  is set for these claims 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are re estimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually given credibility  and reserves are increased accordingly 
key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and lae relate to the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely 
table of contents affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
key assumptions as of december  that are premised on future emergence that are inconsistent with historical loss reserve development patterns include but are not limited to adverse changes in loss cost trends  including inflationary pressures in home repair costs  judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability  and plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers  in purported class action litigation related to claims handling and other practices 
by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled  potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty 
since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year and claims that have occurred but have not been reported pure ibnr claims 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses are related to damaged homes 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest re estimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving litigation 
reserves for catastrophe losses 
loss and lae reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property casualty insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
a catastrophe is an event that produces significant pre tax losses before reinsurance and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  tornadoes  wildfires  tropical storms and hurricanes 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to be able to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain  or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe 
key actuarial assumptions that affect the loss and lae estimate 
the aggregation of estimates for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  actuarial techniques are applied to the data elements for paid losses and reported losses separately for homeowners 
table of contents losses excluding catastrophe losses and catastrophe losses to estimate the potential variability of our reserves  within a reasonable probability of outcomes 
at any given point in time  our loss reserve represents our best estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration cost of our insured claims incurred and unpaid 
since the process of estimating loss reserves requires significant judgment due to a number of variables  such as fluctuations in inflation  judicial decisions  legislative changes and changes in claims handling procedures  our ultimate liability may exceed or be less than these estimates 
we revise reserves for losses and lae as additional information becomes available  and reflect adjustments  if any  in earnings in the periods in which they are determined 
on an annual basis  our independent actuary provides a statement of actuarial opinion sao that certifies the carried reserves make a reasonable provision for all of upcic s unpaid loss and lae obligations under the terms of our contracts and agreements with our policyholders 
we review the sao and compare the projected ultimate losses and lae per the sao to our own projection of ultimate losses and lae to ensure that loss and lae reserves recorded at each annual balance sheet date are based upon our analysis of all internal and external factors related to known and unknown claims against us and to ensure our reserves are within national association of insurance commissioners naic guidelines 
we compare our recorded reserves to the indicated range provided in the report accompanying the sao 
at december   the recorded amount for net loss and lae falls within the range determined by our independent actuaries and is higher than their best estimate 
in selecting the rtr development factors described above in the section titled the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates  due consideration is given to how the rtr development factors change from one year to the next over the course of several consecutive years of recent history 
in addition to the loss development triangles cited above  various diagnostic triangles  such as triangles showing historical patterns in the ratio of paid to reported losses and paid to reported claim counts  are typically prepared as a means of determining the stability of various determinants of loss development  such as consistency in claims settlement and case reserving 
with respect to universal s primary exposure  florida personal property coverage  the hurricanes in and required universal to place more focus on adjusting hurricane claims during  and into universal then experienced a surge in non hurricane claims which led the loss development patterns for non catastrophe losses to increase substantially in the years during and following the active hurricane seasons of and potential reserve estimate variability 
given the nature of universal s business catastrophe exposed personal property coverage  the methods employed by actuaries include a range of estimated unpaid losses reflecting a level of uncertainty 
the range of estimated ultimate losses is typically smaller for older  more mature accident periods and greater for more recent  less mature accident periods 
the greatest level of uncertainty is associated with accident years during which catastrophe events occurred 
for example  the increased uncertainty associated with accident years and increases the bounds of the range 
in selecting the range of reasonable estimates  the assumptions used to select development factors and initial expected loss ratios are not changed 
rather  the range of indications produced by the various methods is inspected  the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method are considered  and from those inputs a range of estimates can be selected 
projections of loss and lae liabilities are subject to potentially large errors of estimation since the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the financial statement date  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred 
examples of these events include jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes  public attitudes  and social economic conditions such as inflation 
any estimate of future costs is subject to the inherent limitation on one s ability to predict the aggregate course of future events 
it should therefore be expected that the actual emergence of losses and lae will vary  perhaps materially  from any estimate 
the inherent uncertainty associated with upcic s loss and lae liability is magnified due to upcic s concentration of property business in catastrophe exposed coastal states  primarily florida 
the and hurricanes created great uncertainty in determining ultimate losses for these natural catastrophes 
issues related to applicability of deductibles  availability and cost of repair services and materials  and other factors have increased the variability in estimates of the related loss reserves 
upcic has experienced unanticipated unfavorable loss development on catastrophe losses from claims related to and being reopened and new claims being opened due to public adjusters encouraging policyholders to file new claims  and from assessments related to condominium policies 
due to the inherent uncertainty  the parameters of the loss estimation methodologies are updated on an annual basis as new information emerges 

table of contents adequacy of reserve estimates 
we believe our net loss and lae reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for reported losses and ibnr losses and as a result we believe no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
the company has created a proprietary claims analysis tool pp to analyze and calculate reserves 
pp is a custom built application by upcic that aggregates  analyzes and forecasts reserves based on historical data that spans more than a decade 
it identifies historical claims data using same like kind and quality variables that exist in present claims and sets forth appropriate  more accurate reserves on current claims 
pp is reviewed by upcic management on a weekly basis in reviewing the topography of existing and incoming claims 
pp will be analyzed at each quarters end and adjustments to reserves are made at an aggregate level when appropriate 
pp was initially used for third quarter reserve analysis resulting in an increase in loss year reserves 
further refinements were put into place in fourth quarter which included inflation adjustments for past claims into dollars inflation guard 
pp was reviewed by an independent third party for data integrity and system reliability 
the program was used for fourth quarter analysis and supported the company s independent actuary s best figures for development in prior years 
the system indicated reserves for the loss year that exceeded actuary s best figures and system figures were used at year end 
this program will be used for quarterly reviews on an ongoing basis 
due to the uncertainties involved  the scenarios described and quantified above are reasonably likely  but the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
the net reserve for unpaid losses and lae at december  is  deferred policy acquisition costs deferred ceding commissions 
commissions and other costs of acquiring insurance that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they are related 
determination of costs other than commissions that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business requires estimates to allocate certain operating expenses 
as of december   deferred policy acquisition costs were  and deferred ceding commissions were  deferred policy acquisition costs were reduced by deferred ceding commissions and shown net on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of  provision for premium deficiency 
it is the company s policy to evaluate and recognize losses on insurance contracts when estimated future claims and maintenance costs under a group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and investment income 
the determination of the provision for premium deficiency requires estimation of the costs of losses  catastrophic reinsurance and policy maintenance to be incurred and investment income to be earned over the remaining policy period 
the company has determined that a provision for premium deficiency was not warranted as of december  reinsurance 
in the normal course of business  the company seeks to reduce the risk of loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
while ceding premiums to reinsurers reduces the company s risk of exposure in the event of catastrophic losses  it also reduces the company s potential for greater profits should such catastrophic events fail to occur 
the company believes that the extent of its reinsurance is typical of a company of its size in the homeowners insurance industry 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the reinsurance agreement and consistent with the establishment of the liability of the company 
upcic s reinsurance policies do not relieve the upcpc from its obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company  consequently  allowances are established for amounts deemed uncollectible 
no such allowance was deemed necessary as of december  new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to existing guidance on accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
the amendments modify the types of costs incurred by insurance entities that can be capitalized in the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts 
under this guidance  these deferred acquisition costs are varied and related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts 
those costs include agent and broker commissions  salaries of certain employees involved in underwriting and policy issuance  and medical and inspection fees 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  therefore  the company is required to 
table of contents adopt this guidance on january  the company is currently evaluating the requirements of the amendments and the potential impact  if any  on the company s financial position and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements during related parties downes and associates  a multi line insurance adjustment corporation based in deerfield beach  florida performs certain claims adjusting work for upcic 
downes and associates is owned by dennis downes  who is the father of sean p 
downes  chief operating officer and senior vice president of upcic 
during  and  the company expensed claims adjusting fees of   and  respectively  to downes and associates 
during the fourth quarter of  the company overpaid non equity incentive plan compensation to the chief executive officer and chief operating officer in the amounts of  and  respectively 
these amounts were repaid to the company during february results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the company s earnings per diluted share were for the period versus in the same period last year 
the following discussion provides comparative information for each component of net income and comprehensive income for compared to direct premiums written increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the year ended december   saw continued growth in policy count for upcic  the company s wholly owned regulated insurance subsidiary 
the increase in the number of policies in force continued to be the result of strengthened relationships with existing agents  an increase in the number of new agents  and continued expansion within florida and in south carolina  north carolina  and hawaii 
as of december  and  upcic was servicing  and  homeowners and dwelling fire insurance policies with in force premiums of  and  respectively 
the wind mitigation discounts mandated by the florida legislature in continue to adversely affect upcic s premiums compared to historical rates 
however  the rate of decrease in premiums due to the wind mitigation discounts was less in than net premiums earned increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in direct premiums earned and a proportionally lower increase in ceded premiums earned related to changes in the reinsurance program as described in note reinsurance in the accompanying notes to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item below 
insurers like upcic experience the impact of rate or discount changes up to months after they are implemented because the changes are effective as policies renew throughout the year 
although insurers may seek to rectify any rate discrepancies through subsequent rate increase filings with the oir  there is no assurance that the oir and the insurers will agree on the amount of rate change that is needed

catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance business which may contribute to material year to year fluctuations in upcic s and the company s results of operations and financial position 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  the company did not experience any catastrophic events 
the level of catastrophe loss experienced in any year cannot be predicted and could be material to the results of operations and financial position of upcic and the company

general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to several factors including an increase in direct commissions in correlation with the increase in direct premiums written  partially offset by an increase in ceded commissions paid  and an increase in state taxes on premiums directly related to the increase on written premiums 
federal and state income taxes increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  federal and state income taxes were of pretax income for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to non deductible compensation

the florida legislature expanded the reimbursement coverage available from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund in causing residential insurers in florida to reduce rates based upon presumptive costs savings as calculated by the oir and later based upon a true up filing using their own data 
in  the florida financial services commission increased then existing discounts available for homes built with certain windstorm loss reduction devices 
we believe these cumulative discounts result in premium reductions that are greater than the estimated reductions in losses 
the company s operating results in were also influenced by legislative enactments relating to claims payments 
following the and hurricane seasons  the florida legislature required all insurers issuing replacement cost policies to pay the full replacement cost of damaged properties without deducting depreciation whether or not the insureds repaired or replaced the damaged property 
under prior law  insurers would pay the depreciated amount of the property until insureds commenced repairs or replacement 
the new law has led to an increase in disagreements regarding the scope of damage and has resulted in insureds not repairing damage 
although upcic seeks to review diligently claims and promptly pay meritorious amounts  the company s operating results may be affected by a claims environment in florida that produces opportunities for fraudulent or overstated claims 
the year ended december  saw continued growth in policy count for upcic  the company s wholly owned regulated insurance subsidiary 
the increase in the number of policies in force continued to be the result of heightened relationships with existing agents  an increase in new agents  a new web based policy administration system  and the disruption in the marketplace following the windstorm catastrophes in and despite growth in the number of policies in force during the year ended december   the company experienced a decrease in net income in the current period primarily as a result of the effects of state mandated rate reductions and discounts  and increased losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
in january  the florida legislature passed a law designed to reduce residential catastrophe reinsurance costs and requiring insurance companies to offer corresponding rate reductions to policyholders 
the new law expanded the amount of reinsurance available from the fhcf  which is a state run entity providing hurricane reinsurance to residential insurers at premiums less than the private reinsurance market 
the legislature intended for 
table of contents the new law to reduce residential insurers reinsurance costs by allowing them to directly replace some of their private market reinsurance with less costly fhcf reinsurance 
for the reinsurance contract years commencing june  and june   upcic purchased the maximum additional coverage available to the company under the expanded fhcf  allowing upcic to maximize its cost savings from the new law 
for the june  reinsurance contract year  upcic elected to purchase florida hurricane catastrophe fund recovery shortfall reinsurance fhcf recovery shortfall reinsurance in the event the fhcf could not fulfill its payment obligations for the hurricane season 
for the june  reinsurance contract year  a similar fhcf recovery shortfall reinsurance product was unavailable in the marketplace 
for the june  contract year upcic purchased the traditional fhcf coverage and did not purchase the temporary increase in coverage limit option offered to insurers by the fhcf 
upcic s decision to forego the purchase of the temporary increase in coverage limit option offered to insurers by the fhcf was based on the fhcf s potential lack of loss reimbursement capacity 
prior to the june  reinsurance contract year  the florida state board of administration sba published its most recent estimate of the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity in the florida administrative weekly on may  the sba estimated that the fhcf s total loss reimbursement capacity under the then current market conditions for the contract year was billion over the month period following the estimate 
the sba also referred to its report  entitled  may estimated loss reimbursement capacity report as providing greater detail regarding the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity 
the report estimated that the fhcf s minimum month loss reimbursement capacity was billion and its maximum month loss reimbursement capacity was billion 
upcic s fhcf mandatory layer of coverage for the contract year commencing june   corresponds to fhcf loss reimbursement capacity of billion 
further  on october   the florida state board of administration sba published its most recent estimate of the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity in the florida administrative weekly 
the sba estimated that the fhcf s total loss reimbursement capacity under current market conditions for the contract year is projected to be billion over the month period following the estimate 
the sba also referred to its report entitled  october estimated claims paying capacity report report as providing greater detail regarding the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity 
the report estimated that the fhcf s minimum month loss reimbursement capacity is billion and its maximum month loss reimbursement capacity is billion 
by law  the fhcf s obligation to reimburse insurers is limited to its actual claims paying capacity 
in addition  the cost of upcic s reinsurance program may increase should upcic deem it necessary to purchase additional private market reinsurance due to reduced estimates of the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity 
florida s legislature also has implemented strategies to improve the ability of residential structures to withstand hurricanes 
new construction must meet stronger building codes  and existing homes are eligible for an inspection program that allows homeowners to determine how their homes may be upgraded to mitigate storm damage 
an increasing number of insureds are likely to qualify for insurance premium discounts as new homes are built and existing homes are retrofitted 
these premium discounts result from homes reduced vulnerability to hurricane losses due to the mitigation efforts  which upcic takes into account in its underwriting and profitability models

as of  of upcic policyholders were receiving wind mitigation credits totaling  a reduction of in force premium 
net premiums earned decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to an increase in direct premiums earned net of previously discussed rate decreases and implementation of wind mitigation credits and a proportionally higher increase in ceded premiums earned related to changes in the reinsurance program as described in note reinsurance in the accompanying notes to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item below 
the higher volume of state required wind mitigation premium discounts had a significant negative effect on the company s premium volume and net income 
on october   upcic received approval for a premium rate increase for its homeowner s program within the state of florida 
the premium rate increase  which will average approximately percent statewide  was approved by the oir 
the effective dates for the premium rate increase are october  for new business and december  for renewal business 
upcic expects the approved premium rate increases to have a favorable effect on premiums written and earned in future months as new and renewal policies are written at the higher rates

the premium rate increase  which will average approximately percent statewide  was approved by the oir 
the effective dates for the premium rate increase are november  for new business and december  for renewal business 
upcic expects the approved premium rate increases to have a favorable effect on premiums written and earned in future months as new and renewal policies are written at the higher rates 
insurers like upcic fully experience the impact of rate or discount changes more than months after they are implemented because their policies renew throughout the year 
although insurers may seek to rectify any problems through subsequent rate increase filings with the oir  there is no assurance that the oir and the insurers will agree on the amount of rate change that is needed

however  except for direct incurred losses and lae of approximately million  or of direct earned premium  related to tropical storm fay in  the company s loss experience did not vary significantly during the year compared to the year 
direct incurred losses and lae related to tropical storm fay were ceded to upcic s quota share reinsurer at  or  the ceded loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the ceded loss and lae ratio was influenced by greater direct incurred loss and lae ceded under the company s quota share reinsurance treaty and higher catastrophe premiums ceded to reinsurers in the period compared to the period

general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to several factors 
direct commissions paid increased in correlation with the increase in direct premiums written 
in addition  state taxes on premiums were affected by the increase in written premiums 
salaries increased for existing employees and higher employee count due to business growth 
also  ceding commissions decreased as a result of the quota share reinsurance commission rate reduction associated with the contract year quota share reinsurance contract 
deferred policy acquisition costs were also affected by this rate reduction

table of contents federal and state income taxes decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  federal and state income taxes were of pretax income for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its short and long term obligations 
the balance of cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million 
most of this amount is available to pay claims in the event of a catastrophic event pending reimbursement amounts recoverable under reinsurance agreements 
uih s liquidity requirements primarily include the payment of dividends to shareholders and interest and principal on debt obligations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to shareholders will be at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company s operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
the maximum amount of dividends  which can be paid by florida insurance companies without prior approval of the commissioner of the oir  is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus 
the maximum dividend that may be paid by upcic to the uih without prior approval is limited to the lesser of statutory net income from operations of the preceding calendar year or statutory unassigned surplus as of the preceding year end 
during the years ended december  and  upcic did not pay dividends to uih

the company s insurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies sold by the company 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums  commissions  policy fees and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay loss claims and operating expenses 
the company maintains substantial investments in highly liquid  marketable securities 
liquidity can also be generated by funds received upon the sale of marketable securities in the company s investment portfolio

the report estimated that the fhcf s minimum month claims paying capacity is billion and its maximum month claims paying capacity is billion with an average claims paying capacity of billion 
this projected claims paying capacity exceeds the fhcf s maximum statutory obligation for of billion 
claims paying capacity exceeding the fhcf s maximum statutory obligation for a single contract year may be available for insurer reimbursements in future contract years

fortunately  no hurricanes made landfall in florida during the contract year and no reimbursement payments for the contract year were required from the fhcf 
table of contents to participating companies 
accordingly  the effect of the change in the fhcf s estimate had no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
funds from operations generated by the company have generally been sufficient to meet liquidity requirements and we expect that in the future funds from operations will continue to meet such requirements 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the company had total capital of  comprised of shareholders equity of  and total debt of  the company s debt to total capital ratio and debt to equity ratio were and  respectively  at december  upcic is required annually to comply with the naic risk based capital rbc requirements 
rbc requirements prescribe a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
naic s rbc requirements are used by regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers who show signs of weak or deteriorating condition 
as of december   based on calculations using the appropriate naic rbc formula  upcic s reported total adjusted capital was in excess of the requirements 
failure by upcic to maintain the required level of statutory capital and surplus could result in the suspension of upcic s authority to write new or renewal business  other regulatory actions or ultimately  in the revocation of upcic s certificate of authority by the oir

the new law contains methods for calculating compliance with the writing ratio requirements that are more favorable to upcic than prior law and the prior terms of the surplus note 
on november   upcic and the sba executed an addendum to the surplus note addendum that reflects these law changes 
the terms of the addendum were effective july  in addition to other less significant changes  the addendum modifies the definitions of minimum required surplus  minimum writing ratio  surplus  and gross written premium  as defined in the original surplus note
