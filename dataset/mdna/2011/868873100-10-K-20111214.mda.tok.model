drug delivery and surface modification markets medical device industry advances in medical device technology have helped drive improved device efficacy and patient outcomes 
pacemakers and defibrillators have dramatically reduced deaths from cardiac arrhythmias 
stents  particularly drug eluting stents  have significantly reduced the need for repeat intravascular procedures  and they have diminished the need for more invasive cardiac bypass surgery 
hip  knee and spine implants have relieved pain and increased mobility 
acceptance of these and other similar innovations by patients  physicians and insurance companies has helped the us medical device industry grow at a faster pace than the economy as a whole 
the attractiveness of the industry has drawn intense competition among the companies participating in this area 
in an effort to improve their existing products or develop entirely new devices  a growing number of medical device manufacturers are exploring or using drug delivery and surface modification technologies as product differentiators or device enablers 
in addition  the continuing trend toward minimally invasive surgical procedures  which often employ catheter based delivery technologies  has increased the demand for hydrophilic  lubricious coatings and other technologies 
convergence of the medical device  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries the convergence of the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries  often made possible by drug delivery and surface modification technologies  presents a powerful opportunity for major advancements in the healthcare industry 
the dramatic success of drug eluting stents in interventional cardiology has captured the attention of the drug and medical device industries 
we believe the benefits of combining drugs and biologics with implantable devices are becoming increasingly valuable in applications in cardiology  ophthalmology  orthopedics  and other large markets 
in addition  the ability to create sustained release formulations of drugs and biologics presents another opportunity for the company 
surmodics drug delivery and surface modification technologies overview we believe surmodics is positioned to exploit the continuing trend of incorporating drug delivery and surface modification technologies into the design of products such as devices and drugs  potentially leading to 
table of contents more efficient and effective products as well as creating entirely new product applications 
we have a growing portfolio of proprietary technologies  market expertise and insight  and unique collaborative research and development capabilities all key ingredients to bring innovation together for the benefit of patients  the company  and the healthcare industry 
coatings for drug delivery and surface modification our drug delivery coating technologies allow therapeutic drugs to be incorporated within our proprietary polymer matrices to provide controlled  site specific release of the drug into the surrounding environment 
the release of the drug can be tuned to elute quickly within minutes to a few days or slowly ranging from several months to over a year  illustrating the wide range of release profiles that can be achieved with our coating systems 
on a wide range of devices  drug eluting coatings can help improve device performance  increase patient safety and enable innovative new treatments 
we work with companies in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to develop specialized coatings that allow for the controlled release of drugs from device surfaces 
we see at least three primary areas with strong future potential improving the function of a device which itself is necessary to treat the medical condition  enabling drug delivery in cases where the device serves only as a vehicle to deliver a drug to a specific site in the body  and enhancing the biocompatibility of a medical device to ensure that it continues to function over a long period of time 
we offer customers several distinct polymer families for site specific drug delivery 
our bravo drug delivery polymer matrix bravo is a durable coating and has been used in a variety of applications 
in addition  we offer several biodegradable polymer technologies that can be used for drug delivery applications 
because some biodegradable polymers can deliver proteins and other large molecule therapeutic agents  they have the potential to expand the breadth of drug delivery applications we can pursue 
biodegradable polymers can be combined with one or more drugs and applied to a medical device where the drug can then be released as the polymer degrades in the body over time 
our proprietary photolink coating technology is a versatile  easily applied  coating technology that modifies medical device surfaces by creating covalent bonds between device surfaces and a variety of chemical agents 
photolink coatings can impart many performance enhancing characteristics  such as advanced lubricity slippery and hemocompatibility preventing clot formation  when bound onto surfaces of medical devices or other biological materials without materially changing the dimensions or other physical properties of devices 
our photolink technology utilizes proprietary  light activated photochemical reagents  which include advanced polymers or active biomolecules having desired surface characteristics and an attached light reactive chemical compound photogroup 
when the reagent is exposed to a direct light source  typically ultraviolet light  a photochemical reaction creates a covalent bond between the photogroup and the surface of the medical device  thereby imparting the desired property to the surface 
a covalent bond is a very strong chemical bond that results from the sharing of electrons between carbon atoms of the substrate and the applied coating  making the coating very durable and resilient 
our proprietary photolink reagents can be applied to a variety of substrates 
our reagents are easily applied to the material surface by a variety of methods including  but not limited to  dipping  spraying  roll coating  ink jetting or brushing 
we continue to expand our portfolio of proprietary reagents for use by our customers 
these reagents enable our customers to develop novel surface features for their devices  satisfying the expanding requirements of the healthcare industry 
we are also continually working to expand the list of materials that are compatible with our drug delivery and surface modification reagents 
additionally  we develop coating processes and coating equipment to meet the device quality  manufacturing throughput and cost requirements of our customers 
key differentiating characteristics of our coatings are their durability  flexibility and ease of use 
in terms of flexibility  coatings can be applied to many different kinds of surfaces and can immobilize a variety of chemical  pharmaceutical and biological agents 
this flexibility allows customers to be innovative in the design of their products without significantly changing the dimensions or other physical properties of the device 
additionally  
table of contents the surface modification process can be tailored to provide customers with the ability to improve the performance of their devices by choosing the specific coating properties desired for particular applications 
our surface modification technologies also can be combined to deliver multiple surface enhancing characteristics on the same device 
in terms of ease of use  the photolink coating process is relatively simple and is easily integrated into the customer s manufacturing process 
in addition  it does not subject the coated products to harsh chemical or temperature conditions  produces no hazardous byproducts  and does not require lengthy processing or curing time 
further  our photolink coatings are generally compatible with accepted sterilization processes  so the surface attributes are not lost when the medical device is sterilized 
surmodics drug delivery and surface modification technologies clinical benefits drug delivery 
we provide drug delivery polymer technology to enable controlled  site specific or systemic delivery of therapeutic agents 
our proprietary polymer reagents create matrices that serve as reservoirs for therapeutic drugs 
the drugs can then be released on a controlled basis over days  weeks or months 
some of our systems can release drugs for over a year 
for instance  when a drug eluting stent is implanted into a patient  the drug releases from the surface of the stent into the blood vessel wall where it can act to inhibit unwanted tissue growth  thereby reducing the occurrence of restenosis 
lubricity 
low friction or lubricious coatings reduce the force and time required for insertion  navigation and removal of devices in a variety of minimally invasive applications 
based on internal and customer evaluations  when compared with uncoated surfaces  our photolink coatings have reduced the friction on surfaces by more than  depending on the surface being coated 
lubricity also reduces tissue irritation and damage caused by products such as catheters  guidewires and endoscopy devices 
further  lubricious coatings can improve deliverability of a medical device  which can enhance the physician s ability to place a medical device in the intended anatomical site within the patient s body 
prohealing 
biologically based extracellular matrix ecm protein coatings for use in various applications are designed to improve and accelerate the healing of the tissue at or near the implant site through nature s own healing mechanisms following procedures involving implantable medical devices 
certain ecm proteins  such as collagen and laminin  specifically stimulate the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells cells that line blood vessels to promote healing 
by covalently attaching the appropriate ecm proteins to device surfaces utilizing the photolink coating process  the biomimetic surface can signal endothelial cells in the blood and vascular wall to form a stable endothelial lining over the implant 
we believe these prohealing coatings could help prevent late stent thrombosis 
hemo biocompatibility 
hemocompatible biocompatible coatings help reduce adverse reactions that may be created when a device is inserted into the body and comes in contact with blood 
heparin has been used for decades as an injectable drug to reduce blood clotting in patients 
photolink reagents can be used to immobilize heparin on the surface of medical devices  thereby inhibiting blood clotting on the device surface  minimizing patient risk and enhancing the performance of the device 
we have also developed synthetic  non biological coatings that provide medical device surfaces with improved blood compatibility without the use of heparin 
these coatings prevent undesirable cells and proteins that lead to clot formation from adhering to the device surface 
these coatings may also reduce fibrous encapsulation 
dna and protein immobilization 
both dna and protein microarrays are useful tools for the pharmaceutical  diagnostic and research industries 
during a dna gene analysis  typically thousands of different probes need to be placed in a pattern on a surface  called a dna microarray 
these microarrays are used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for new drugs  by genome mappers to sequence human  animal or plant genomes  or by diagnostic companies to search a patient sample for disease causing bacteria or viruses 
however  dna does not readily adhere to most surfaces 
we have developed various surface chemistries for both dna and protein immobilization 
in september  we re acquired the rights to 
table of contents our microarray slide product line which had previously been marketed by ge healthcare under the codelink trademark 
as part of this transaction  we obtained the right to use the codelink trademark from ge healthcare in the sale and marketing of the product lines we re acquired 
protein microarrays are used as diagnostic and research tools to determine the presence and or quantity of proteins in a biological sample 
the most common type of protein microarray is the antibody microarray  where antibodies are spotted onto a surface and used as capture molecules for protein detection 

table of contents surmodics drug delivery and surface modification technologies applications the table below identifies several market segments where drug delivery and surface modification technologies are desired to improve and enable both existing and new medical devices and drugs

table of contents examples of applications for our coating technologies include guidewires  angiography catheters  ivus catheters  neuro microcatheters infusion catheters  ptca pta laser and balloon angioplasty catheters  atherectomy systems  chronic total occlusion catheters  stent delivery catheters  cardiovascular stents  embolic protection devices  vascular closure devices  ep catheters  pacemaker leads  drug infusion catheters  wound drains  ureteral stents  urological catheters and implants  hydrocephalic shunts  and ophthalmic implants  among other devices 
beyond coatings  our drug delivery technologies have also been applied to a wide range of drugs currently in preclinical and clinical development 
licensing arrangements we commercialize our drug delivery and surface modification technologies primarily through licensing arrangements with medical device and drug manufacturers 
we believe this approach allows us to focus our resources on further developing new technologies and expanding our licensing activities 
many of our technologies have been designed to allow manufacturers to easily implement them into their own manufacturing processes so customers can control production and quality internally without the need to send their products to a contract manufacturer 
other customers  particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  prefer to outsource the manufacturing of drug delivery formulations to partners 
we generate the largest portion of our revenue through licensing arrangements 
royalties and license fees represented  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue from these licensing arrangements typically includes license fees and milestone payments  minimum royalties  and royalties based on a percentage of licensees product sales 
we also generate revenue from sales of chemical reagents to licensees for use in their coating processes  and  prior to the pharma sale  from polymer sales under our lakeshore biomaterials brand 
our in vitro diagnostics business unit generates revenue from sales of stabilization products  substrates  antigens and microarray slides to diagnostics customers 
product sales represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development fees represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the licensing process begins with the customer specifying a desired product feature to be created such as lubricity  drug delivery  etc 
because each device and drug is unique  we routinely conduct a feasibility study to qualify each new potential product application  often generating research and development revenue 
once the feasibility phase has been completed in a manner satisfactory to the customer  the customer funds a development project to optimize the formulation to meet the customer s specific technical needs 
at any time prior to commercialization  a license agreement may be executed granting the licensee rights to use our technology 
we often support our customers by providing coating assistance for parts required in animal tests and human clinical trials 
however  most customers perform the coating work internally once a product has received regulatory approval and is being actively marketed 
the term of a license agreement is generally for a specified number of years or the life of our patents  whichever is longer  although a license generally may be terminated by the licensee for any reason upon days advance written notice 
our license agreements may include certain license fees and or milestone payments 
the license can be either exclusive or nonexclusive  but a significant majority of our licensed applications are nonexclusive  allowing us to license technology to multiple customers 
moreover  even exclusive licenses generally are limited to a specific field of use  allowing us the opportunity to further license technology to other customers 
the royalty rate on a substantial number of the agreements has traditionally been in the to range  but there are certain contracts with lower or higher rates 
royalty rates in certain more recent agreements have been trending higher  especially where the relevant surmodics technology is an enabling component of the customer s device ie  the device could not perform as desired without our technology 
the amount of the license fees  milestone payments  and the royalty rate are based on various factors  including the stage of development of the product or technology being licensed  whether the arrangement is exclusive or nonexclusive  the perceived value of our technology to the customer s product  size of the potential market  and customer preferences 
most of our agreements also incorporate a minimum royalty to be paid by the licensee 
royalties are generally paid one quarter after the customer s actual product sales occur because of the delay in reporting sales by our licensees 

table of contents as of september   we had over licensed product classes customer products utilizing surmodics technology already on the market generating royalties and greater than customer product classes incorporating our technology in various stages of pre commercialization 
we signed new licenses in fiscal  compared with in fiscal all of our product classes that were under development or pending regulatory approval as of september   are subject to the terms of license agreements between us and our customers 
generally  medical device  biotechnology and pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are required to undergo long  expensive and uncertain regulatory review processes that are governed by the united states us food and drug administration fda and other international regulatory authorities 
the time required to obtain regulatory approval and  hence market introduction  for these products varies considerably depending on the product  its clinical application  the jurisdiction where approval is being sought  and the extent of clinical testing needed 
this timing can range anywhere from several months eg  for medical device products seeking regulatory approval in the us under the k approval process to several years eg  for pharmaceutical products seeking regulatory approval in the us under the new drug application process  or medical device products under the pre market approval process 
under our agreements with our customers  the responsibility for securing regulatory approval for  and ultimately commercializing these products rests with our customers 
our reliance on our customers in this regard and the potential risks to our operations as a result are discussed in item a risk factors of this form k 
moreover  we are often contractually obligated to keep the details concerning our customers research and development efforts including the timing of expected regulatory filings  approvals and market introductions confidential 
as a result of the significant uncertainty inherent in product development and regulatory approval processes  the fact that those efforts are outside of our control  and because of our contractual obligations to our customers  the expected timing for regulatory approval and commercialization for the product classes pending regulatory approval is uncertain 
under most of our licensing agreements  we are required to keep the identity of our customers confidential unless they approve of such disclosure

in vitro diagnostics products stabilization products surmodics offers a full line of stabilization products for the in vitro diagnostics market 
these products increase sensitivity and extend the shelf life of diagnostic kits  thereby producing more consistent assay results 
surmodics stabilization products are ready to use  eliminating the preparation time and cost of producing stabilization and blocking reagents in house 
substrates since the acquisition of surmodics ivd in august  surmodics has provided colorimetric and chemiluminescent substrates to the in vitro diagnostics market 
a substrate is the component of a diagnostic test kit that detects and signals that a reaction has taken place so that a result can be recorded 
colorimetric substrates signal a positive diagnostic result through a color change 
chemiluminescent substrates signal a positive diagnostic result by emitting light 
we believe that our substrates offer a high level of stability  sensitivity and consistency 

table of contents recombinant human antigens surmodics is the exclusive north american distributor and non exclusive distributor in japan of diarect ag s line of recombinant autoimmune antigens 
because of the lack of high quality antigens from natural sources  diarect produces these proteins and other components using biotechnological methods 
diarect has strong capabilities in the bacilovirus sf expression system for autoimmune antigens as well as e 
coli systems for particular expression tasks 
microarray slide products surmodics offers microarray slide products for use in the diagnostic and biomedical research markets 
microarray slides are used by researchers for dna analysis 
in september  we re acquired the rights to market our microarray slide product line from ge healthcare  including the right to use the codelink trademark in connection with these products 
previously  these products had been marketed by ge healthcare under the codelink trademark 
research and development our research and development r d personnel work to enhance and expand our technology and product offerings in the area of drug delivery  surface modification  and in vitro diagnostics through internal scientific investigation 
these scientists and engineers also evaluate external technologies in support of our corporate development activities 
all of these efforts are guided by the needs of the markets in which we do business 
additionally  the r d staff support the sales staff and business units in performing feasibility studies  providing technical assistance to potential customers  optimizing the relevant technologies for specific customer applications  supporting clinical trials  training customers  and integrating our technologies and know how into customer manufacturing operations 
we work together with our customers to integrate the best possible drug delivery and surface modification technologies with their products  not only to meet their performance requirements  but also to perform services quickly so that the product may reach the market ahead of the competition 
to quickly solve problems that might arise during the development and optimization process  we have developed extensive capabilities in analytical chemistry and surface characterization within our r d organization 
our state of the art instrumentation and extensive experience allow us to test the purity of coating reagents  to monitor the elution rate of drug from coatings  to measure coating thickness and smoothness  and to map the distribution of chemicals throughout coatings 
we believe our capabilities far exceed those of our direct competitors  and sometimes even exceed those of our large company customers 
as medical products become more sophisticated and complex and as competition increases  we believe the need for drug delivery and surface modification will continue to grow 
we intend to continue our development efforts to expand our drug delivery and surface modification technologies to provide additional optimized properties to meet these needs across multiple medical markets 
in addition  we are expanding our drug delivery and surface modification technology expertise to capture more of the final product value 
we are doing this by  in selected cases  developing or acquiring technologies or devices to develop from feasibility stage up to and including animal and human clinical testing stage 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional technologies or devices 
after thorough consideration of each market opportunity  our technical strategy is to target selected formulation characteristics for further development  to facilitate and shorten the license cycle 
we continue to perform research into applications for future products both on our own and in conjunction with some of our customers 
some of the r d projects currently in progress include additional polymer systems for site specific and systemic drug delivery  as well as technologies to improve healing around implantable devices  technologies to deliver nucleic acids  proteins and cell therapies  advanced stabilization reagents  slide based microarray technologies and drug delivery platforms for ophthalmic applications 

table of contents in fiscal  and  our r d expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
of the above amounts  million  million and million were spent on internal r d in fiscal  and  respectively  and million  million and million in those years  respectively  were spent on customer sponsored r d  which includes technology optimization and other development work on customer product applications 
we intend to continue investing in r d to advance our surface modification and in vitro diagnostic technologies and to expand uses for our technology platforms 
in addition  we continue to pursue access to products and technologies developed outside the company as appropriate to complement our internal r d efforts 
patents and proprietary rights patents and other forms of proprietary rights are an essential part of the surmodics business model 
we protect our extensive portfolio of technologies through filing and maintaining patent rights covering a variety of coatings  drug delivery methods  reagents  and formulations  as well as particular clinical device applications 
generally  we seek patent protection in the us for many of our proprietary technologies 
we may also file international patent applications in the locations matching the major markets of our customers primarily in north america  europe  and japan 
excluding filings related to the pharmaceuticals business  since october  surmodics filed us patent applications  as well as international patent applications  expanding the portfolio protection around our current technologies as well as enabling pursuit of new technology concepts  innovations  and directions 
we have licensed our photolink hydrophilic technology to a number of our customers for use in a variety of medical device applications  including those described in surmodics drug delivery and surface modification technologies applications above 
in particular  we have eight issued us patents  four pending us patent applications  issued international patents  and six pending international patent applications protecting various aspects of these technologies  including compositions  methods of manufacture  and methods of coating devices 
the expiration dates for these patents and anticipated expiration dates of the patent applications range from to the company aggressively pursues patent protection covering the proprietary technologies that we consider important to our business 
in addition to seeking patent protection in the us  we also generally file patent applications in european countries and additional foreign countries  including australia  canada  china and japan  on a selective basis 
generally  the expiration dates of our issued patents are determined based on the filing date of the earliest filed patent application from which the patent claims priority 
we strategically manage our patent portfolio so as to ensure that we have valid and enforceable patent rights protecting our technological innovations 
as of december   after the pharma sale  surmodics had pending us patent applications  six of which were exclusively licensed from others  and foreign patent applications  of which were exclusively licensed from others 
likewise  as of december   surmodics owned issued us patents  of which were exclusively licensed from others  and international patents  of which were exclusively licensed from others 
we also rely upon trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary technologies 
we seek to maintain the confidentiality of such information by requiring employees  consultants and other parties to sign confidentiality agreements and by limiting access by parties outside the company to such information 
there can be no assurance  however  that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of this information  or that others will not be able to independently develop such information 
additionally  there can be no assurance that any agreements regarding confidentiality and non disclosure will not be breached  or  in the event of any breach  that adequate remedies would be available to us 
marketing and sales we market our technologies and products throughout the world using a direct sales force consisting of dedicated sales professionals who focus on specific markets and companies 
these sales professionals work in concert with business unit personnel to coordinate customer activities 
the specialization of our sales professionals 
table of contents fosters an in depth knowledge of the issues faced by our customers within these markets such as industry trends  technology changes  biomaterial changes and the regulatory environment 
in addition  we enter into sales and marketing relationships with third parties to distribute our diagnostic products around the world 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding domestic and foreign revenue 
in general  we license our technologies on a non exclusive basis to customers for use on specific products  or on an exclusive basis  but limited to a specific field of use 
this strategy enables us to license our technologies to multiple customers in the same market 
we also target new product applications with existing customers 
to support our marketing and sales activities  we publish technical literature on our various surface modification  drug delivery  and in vitro diagnostics technologies and products 
in addition  we exhibit at major trade shows and technical meetings  advertise in selected trade journals and through our website  and conduct direct mailings to appropriate target markets 
we also offer ongoing customer service and technical support throughout our licensees relationships with us 
this service and support may begin with a feasibility study  and also may include additional services such as assistance in the transfer of the technology to the licensee  further optimization  process control and troubleshooting  preparation of product for clinical studies  and assistance with regulatory submissions for product approval 
most of these services are billable to customers 
acquisitions and investments to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses  we intend to continue to explore acquisitions  investments and strategic collaborations to diversify and grow our business 
as a result  we expect to make future investments or acquisitions where we believe that we can broaden our technology offerings and expand our sources of revenue and the number of markets in which we participate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our minority equity investments 
mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
several acquisitions relating to our pharmaceuticals business are discussed above in overview recent sale of pharmaceuticals business 
in august  we acquired biofx for consideration consisting of an up front payment  including fees  of million and potential additional payments of up to million based upon achievement of certain milestones 
since the acquisition  we have paid the sellers additional consideration of million related to achievement of a milestone  and the sellers are still eligible to receive up to million in additional consideration through calendar potential milestones of million were not earned and lapsed in fiscal significant customers we have two customers that each provided more than of our revenue in fiscal revenue from medtronic and johnson johnson represented approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue for the year ended september  the loss of one or more of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
in june  we received an announcement from cordis  a johnson johnson subsidiary  regarding the cessation of the manufacture of the cypher and cypher select plus stents by the end of competition the ability for drug delivery and surface modification technologies to improve the performance of medical devices and drugs and to enable new product categories has resulted in increased competition in these markets 

table of contents some of our competitors offer drug delivery technologies  while others specialize in lubricious or hemocompatible coating technology 
some of these companies target ophthalmology applications  while others target cardiovascular or other medical device applications 
in addition  because of the many product possibilities afforded by surface modification technologies  many of the large medical device manufacturers have developed  or are engaged in efforts to develop  internal competency in the area of drug delivery and surface modification 
many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing what we believe is a high value added approach to drug delivery and surface modification technology 
we believe that the primary factors customers consider in choosing a particular technology include performance eg  flexibility  ability to fine tune drug elution profiles  biocompatibility  etc  ease of manufacturing  time to market  intellectual property protection  ability to produce multiple properties from a single process  compliance with manufacturing regulations  ability to manufacture clinical and commercial products especially for surmodics pharmaceuticals customers  customer service and total cost of goods including manufacturing process labor 
we believe our technologies deliver exceptional performance in these areas  allowing us to compete favorably with respect to these factors 
we believe that the cost and time required to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals significantly reduces the likelihood of a customer changing the manufacturing process it uses once a device or drug has been approved for sale 
because a significant portion of our revenue depends on the receipt of royalties based on sales of medical devices incorporating our technologies  we are also affected by competition within the markets for such devices 
we believe that the intense competition within the medical device market creates opportunities for our technologies as medical device manufacturers seek to differentiate their products through new enhancements or to remain competitive with enhancements offered by other manufacturers 
because we seek to license our technologies on a non exclusive basis  we may further benefit from competition within the medical device markets by offering our technologies to multiple competing manufacturers of a device 
however  competition in the medical device market could also have an adverse effect on us as demonstrated by the announcement we received  in june  from cordis regarding the cessation of the manufacture of the cypher and cypher select plus stents by the end of while we seek to license our products to established manufacturers  in certain cases our licensees may compete directly with larger  dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we also are unable to control other factors that may impact commercialization of coated devices or drug products  such as regulatory approval  marketing and sales efforts of our licensees or competitive pricing pressures within the particular market 
there can be no assurance that products employing our technologies will be successfully commercialized by our licensees or that such licensees will otherwise be able to compete effectively 
competition in the diagnostics market is highly fragmented 
in the product lines in which we compete protein stabilization reagents  substrates  recombinant autoimmune antigens and surface chemistry technologies  we face an array of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products 
many of our competitors have substantially more capital resources  marketing experience  research and development resources and production facilities than we do 
we believe that our products compete on performance  stability shelf life  sensitivity lower levels detected  faster results  consistency and price 
we believe that our continued competitive success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire new proprietary products  obtain patent or other protection for our products and successfully market our products directly or through partners 
manufacturing historically  we have performed limited manufacturing activities for our customers  other than the manufacture of our in vitro diagnostics products which we sell to our customers  all of which we manufacture in our eden prairie  minnesota facility 
in general  we do not coat medical devices that are intended for commercial sale by our customers  though we often support our customers by coating products intended for pre clinical and clinical development  including human clinical trials and on occasion  even commercial product 
some of our 
table of contents customers  particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  prefer to outsource the manufacturing of drug delivery formulations to partners 
accordingly  in april  we acquired a facility in birmingham  alabama with approximately  square feet of warehouse and office space and constructed a cgmp manufacturing facility there in order to upgrade our manufacturing capabilities 
this facility was opened and qualified in fiscal the cgmp manufacturing facility was sold as part of the pharma sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sale of the surmodics pharmaceuticals business 
we attempt to maintain multiple sources of supply for the key raw materials used to manufacture our products 
we do  however  purchase some raw materials from single sources  but we believe that additional sources of supply are readily available 
further  to the extent additional sources of supply are not readily available  we believe that we could manufacture such raw materials 
we follow quality management procedures in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance for the development and manufacture of materials and pharmaceutical  device  biotechnology or combination products that support clinical trials and commercialization 
in an effort to better meet our customers needs in this area  our eden prairie  minnesota facility received iso and iso certification in fiscal and has received updated certifications as required 
in fiscal  our birmingham  alabama facility received iso and iso certification and received an updated certification in fiscal government regulation although our drug delivery and surface modification technologies themselves are not directly regulated by the us fda  the medical devices  pharmaceutical and biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to fda regulation 
new medical devices utilizing our technologies can only be marketed in the us after a k application has been cleared or a pre market approval application pma has been approved by the fda 
this process can take anywhere from three months for a k application  to two or three years or more for a pma application 
the burden of demonstrating to the fda that a new device is either substantially equivalent to a previously marketed device k marketing clearance process  or in the case of implantable devices  safe and effective pma process  rests with our customers as the medical device manufacturers 
new pharmaceutical and biotechnology products utilizing our technologies can only be marketed in the us after a new drug application nda or biologics license application bla has been approved by the fda 
the burden of obtaining fda approval of the nda or bla rests with our customers 
in support of our customers regulatory filings  we maintain various confidential drug master files  device master files and veterinary master files with the fda and with other regulatory agencies outside the us regarding the nature  chemical structure and biocompatibility of our reagents 
although our licensees generally do not have direct access to these files  they may  with our permission  reference these files in their various regulatory submissions to these agencies 
this approach allows regulatory agencies to understand in confidence the details of our technologies without us having to share this highly confidential information with our customers 
us legislation allows companies  prior to obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a medical product in the us  to manufacture medical products in the us and export them for sale in international markets 
this generally allows us to realize earned royalties sooner 
however  sales of medical products outside the us are subject to international requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required by the fda

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to our business  strategy and industry we are subject to changes in general economic conditions that are beyond our control including recession and declining consumer confidence 
during periods of economic slowdown or recession  such as the us and world economies are currently experiencing  many of our customers are forced to delay or terminate some of their product development plans 
because we rely on licensing and commercialization of our technology by third parties  we may be severely impacted by the decreasing research and development budgets of our customers 
in addition  in an environment of decreasing research and development spending  sales of our in vitro diagnostics products may similarly suffer as a result of the decreased utilization of research focused products 
any sustained period of decreased research and development spending by our customers and potential customers could adversely affect our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
we may also be affected by a reduction in the amount of products purchased by our diagnostic customers 
the decrease in available financing for our customers and for new ventures that could potentially become our customers can reduce our potential opportunities 
one of the consequences of the economic slowdown has been a decrease in the availability of financing for both start up and other developing ventures  which can impact our business in several ways 
for example  some customers have been unable to obtain additional financing and were forced to cease their operations 
because our financial results depend substantially on the success of our customers in commercializing their products  a reduced ability by companies to take their products to market can substantially adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  the decrease in available financing has resulted in fewer start up medical device and biotechnology companies than in prior years 
to the extent that fewer new companies are started  the number of potential customers for our technologies will be smaller  and we may be unable to meet our business goals  which could substantially affect our financial performance 
the loss of  or significant reduction in business from  one or more of our major customers could significantly reduce our revenue  earnings or other operating results 
we have two customers that each provided or more of our revenue in fiscal revenue from medtronic and johnson johnson represented approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  the loss of one or more of our largest customers  or reductions in business from them  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
for example  in june  cordis announced the cessation of the manufacture of the cypher and cypher select plus stents by the end of in july  cordis notified us of its intention to terminate the exclusivity arrangements under the license agreement  which also results in a termination of the minimum quarterly royalty requirements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal there can be no assurance that revenue from any customer will continue at their historical levels 
if we cannot broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
the long term success of our business may suffer if we are unable to expand our licensing base to reduce our reliance upon several major customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customer products 
we intend to continue pursuing a strategy of licensing our technologies to a diversified base of medical device and drug manufacturers and other customers  thereby expanding the commercialization opportunities for our technologies 
success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract new licensees  to enter into agreements for additional applications with existing licensees and to develop and market new applications 
there can be no 
table of contents assurance that we will be able to identify  develop and adapt our technologies for new applications in a timely and cost effective manner  that new license agreements will be executed on terms favorable to us  that new applications will be accepted by customers in our target markets  or that products incorporating newly licensed technology  including new applications  will gain regulatory approval  be commercialized or gain market acceptance 
delays or failures in these efforts could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
drug delivery and surface modification are competitive markets and carry the risk of technological obsolescence 
we operate in a competitive and evolving field  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products in the field of drug delivery and surface modification 
our drug delivery and surface modification technologies compete with technologies developed by a number of other companies 
in addition  many medical device manufacturers have developed  or are engaged in efforts to develop  drug delivery or surface modification technologies for use on their own products 
some of our existing and potential competitors especially medical device manufacturers pursuing coating solutions through their own research and development efforts have greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than us 
competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approval for products before us 
products incorporating our competitors technologies may gain market acceptance more rapidly than products using ours 
developments by competitors may render our existing and potential products uncompetitive or obsolete 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that new products or technologies developed by others  or the emergence of new industry standards  will not render our products or technologies or licensees products incorporating our technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
any new technologies that make our drug delivery or surface modification technologies less competitive or obsolete would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face indemnity and other liability claims pursuant to our agreement with evonik relating to the sale of substantially all of the assets of the pharmaceuticals business 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we have agreed to indemnify evonik against specified losses that might be incurred in connection with evonik s utilization of the acquired assets 
we have also agreed to retain responsibility for certain liabilities that may accrue and we have made representations and warranties to evonik  including matters relating to intellectual property 
following the closing  if evonik makes an indemnification claim because it has suffered a loss or a third party has commenced an action against evonik  we may incur expenses to resolve evonik s claim or to defend evonik and ourselves against the third party action  which expense could harm our operating results 
in addition  such indemnity claims may divert management attention from our continuing business 
it may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party stemmed from actions taken by us or by evonik and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine which party has responsibility for the claim 
failure to identify strategic investment and acquisition opportunities may limit our growth 
an important part of our growth in the future may involve strategic investments and the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies 
our identification of suitable investment opportunities and acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the technology  value  strengths  weaknesses  overall risks and profitability  if any  of investment and acquisition candidates 
we may not be able to identify suitable investment and acquisition candidates 
if we do not make suitable investments and acquisitions  we may find it more difficult to realize our growth objectives 

table of contents the acquisitions that we have made  or any future acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute shareholder value  or harm our operating results 
in recent years we have made several significant acquisitions 
the process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations poses numerous risks  including an inability to assimilate acquired operations  personnel  technology  information systems  and internal control systems and products  diversion of management s attention  including the need to manage several remote locations with a limited management team  difficulties and uncertainties in transitioning the customers or other business relationships from the acquired entity to us  and the loss of key employees of acquired companies 
in addition  future acquisitions by us may be dilutive to our shareholders  and cause large one time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant asset impairment charges in the future 
for example  in the first quarter of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively  which represented a full impairment of the goodwill associated with our surmodics pharmaceuticals acquisition 
strategic investments may result in impairment charges if the value of any such investment declines significantly 
in addition  if we acquire entities that have not yet commercialized products but rather are developing technologies for future commercialization  our earnings per share may fluctuate as we expend significant funds for continued research and development efforts necessary to commercialize such acquired technology 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully complete any investments or acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from investments or acquisitions that we complete 
goodwill or other assets on our balance sheet may become impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet 
as required by the accounting guidance for goodwill  we evaluate at least annually the potential impairment of goodwill 
testing for impairment of goodwill involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
the estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used 
we also evaluate other assets on our balance sheet  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
our estimate of the fair value of the assets may be based on fair value appraisals or discounted cash flow models using various inputs 
future impairment of our remaining goodwill of million related to our in vitro diagnostics business unit or other assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  in the first quarter of fiscal we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to goodwill associated with our acquisition of surmodics pharmaceuticals and had recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to this acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  in fiscal and  we recognized asset impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively 
research and development costs may adversely affect our operating results 
the success of our business depends on a number of factors  including our continued research and development of new technologies for future commercialization 
in researching and developing such new technologies  we may incur significant expenses that may adversely affect our operating results  including our profitability 
additionally  these activities are subject to risks of failure that are inherent in the development of new medical technologies and as a result  may never result in commercially viable technologies 

table of contents our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support our business and integrate acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
executing our business strategy and integrating our past acquisitions has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  development  operational  information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  development  customer support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
otherwise  we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
we recognize revenue in accordance with various complex accounting standards  and changes in circumstances or interpretations may lead to accounting adjustments 
our revenue recognition policies involve application of various complex accounting standards  including accounting guidance associated with revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our compliance with such accounting standards often involves management s judgment regarding whether the criteria set forth in the standards have been met such that we can recognize as revenue the amounts that we receive as payment for our products or services 
we base our judgments on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  these judgments  or the assumptions underlying them  may change over time 
in addition  the sec or the financial accounting standards board fasb may issue new positions or revised guidance on the treatment of complex accounting matters 
changes in circumstances or third party guidance could cause our judgments to change with respect to our interpretations of these complex standards  and transactions recorded  including revenue recognized  for one or more prior reporting periods  could be adversely affected 
risks relating to our operations and reliance on third parties we rely on third parties to market  distribute and sell most products incorporating our technologies  and those third parties may not perform or agreements with those parties could be terminated 
a principal element of our business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical device  pharmaceutical  and biotechnology companies that manufacture products incorporating our technologies 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  we derived approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  from royalties and license fees 
although we do market certain diagnostic products and reagents  we do not currently market  distribute or sell our own medical devices or diagnostic test kits  nor do we intend to do so in the foreseeable future 
thus  our prospects are greatly dependent on the receipt of royalties from licensees of our technologies 
the amount and timing of such royalties are  in turn  dependent on the ability of our licensees to gain successful regulatory approval for  market and sell products incorporating our technologies 
failure of certain licensees to gain regulatory approval or market acceptance for such products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers market and sell and most manufacture the products incorporating our licensed technologies 
if one or more of our licensees fail to pursue the development or marketing of these products as planned  our revenue and profits may not reach our expectations  or may decline 
additionally  our ability to generate positive operating results in connection with the achievement of development or commercialization milestones may also suffer 
for example  merck terminated their collaboration with us relating to the development and potential commercialization of our i vation tm intravitreal implant following a strategic review of its business and product development portfolio in we do not control the timing and other aspects of the development or commercialization of products incorporating our licensed technologies because our customers may have priorities that differ from ours or their development or marketing efforts may be unsuccessful  resulting in delayed or discontinued products 
hence  the amount and timing of revenue we derive from our customers research and development as well as royalty payments received by us will fluctuate  and such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents under our standard license agreements  licensees can terminate the license for any reason upon days prior written notice 
existing and potential licensees have no obligation to deal exclusively with us in obtaining drug delivery or surface modification technologies and may pursue parallel development or licensing of competing technological solutions on their own or with third parties 
a decision by a licensee to terminate its relationship with us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have limited or no redundancy in our manufacturing facilities  and we may lose revenue and be unable to maintain our customer relationships if we lose our production capacity 
given the pharma sale  which included the sale of the birmingham  alabama manufacturing facility  we now manufacture all of the products we sell in our existing production areas in our eden prairie  minnesota facility 
in august  we began the production of our biofx products from our headquarters facility in eden prairie  minnesota 
there are a number of risks associated with this move  including decreased efficiency associated with the relocation  product quality issues related to the transition  lack of continuity in key support functions and damaged customer relationships as a result of any of the above disruptions 
if we experience any of the above issues associated with our recent change in our production operations  we could experience material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our existing production facility becomes incapable of manufacturing products for any reason  we may be unable to meet production requirements  we may lose revenue and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our customers  including certain of our licensees 
in particular  because most of our customers use these reagents to create royalty bearing products  failure by us to deliver products  including polymers and reagents  could result in decreased royalty revenue  as well as decreased revenue from the sale of products 
without our existing production facility  we would have no other means of manufacturing products until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at the facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate  this insurance does not cover all possible situations 
in addition  our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
we may face product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials  the use or misuse of our products or the manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical products 
the development and sale of medical devices and component products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims 
although in most cases our customer agreements provide indemnification against such claims  there can be no guarantee that product liability claims will not be filed against us for such products  that parties indemnifying us will have the financial ability to honor their indemnification obligations or that such manufacturers will not seek indemnification or other relief from us for any such claims 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we have obtained a level of liability insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate to our activities  however we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  we do not expect to be able to obtain insurance covering our costs and losses as a result of any recall of products or devices incorporating our technologies because of alleged defects  whether such recall is instituted by us  by a customer  or is required by a regulatory agency 
a product liability claim  recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue will be harmed if we cannot purchase sufficient reagent components we use in our manufacture of reagents 
we currently purchase some of the components we use to manufacture reagents from sole suppliers 
if any of our sole suppliers becomes unwilling to supply components to us  experiences an interruption in its production or is otherwise unable to provide us with sufficient material to manufacture our reagents  we will experience 
table of contents production interruptions 
if we lose our sole supplier of any particular reagent component or are otherwise unable to procure all components required for our reagent manufacturing for an extended period of time  we may lose the ability to manufacture the reagents our customers require to commercialize products incorporating our technology 
this could result in lost royalties and product sales  which would harm our financial results 
adding suppliers to our approved vendor list may require significant time and resources since we typically thoroughly review a supplier s business and operations to become comfortable with the quality and integrity of the materials we purchase for use with our technology  including reviewing a supplier s manufacturing processes and evaluating the suitability of materials and packaging procedures the supplier uses 
we routinely attempt to maintain multiple suppliers of each of our significant materials  so we have alternative suppliers  if necessary 
however  if the number of suppliers of a material is reduced  or if we are otherwise unable to obtain our material requirements on a timely basis and on favorable terms  our operations may be harmed 
we are dependent upon key personnel and may not be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
our success is dependent upon our ability to retain and attract highly qualified management and technical personnel 
we face intense competition for such qualified personnel 
we do not maintain key person insurance  and we generally do not enter into employment agreements  except for with certain executive officers 
although we have non compete agreements with most employees  there can be no assurance that such agreements will be enforceable 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to our intellectual property we may not be able to obtain  maintain or protect proprietary rights necessary for the commercialization of our technologies 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patents  maintain trade secret protection  operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties and protect our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties 
we have been granted us and foreign patents and have us and foreign patent applications pending related to our proprietary technologies 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent application will be approved  that we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  that any patents issued will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged or invalidated by third parties  that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies  or that others will not independently develop similar technologies or design around our patents 
furthermore  because we generate a significant amount of our revenue through licensing arrangements  the loss or expiration of patent protection for our key technologies will result in a reduction of the revenue derived from these arrangements which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  cash flow  results of operations  financial position and prospects 
we may become involved in expensive and unpredictable patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings which could result in liability for damages  or impair our development and commercialization efforts 
our commercial success also will depend  in part  on our ability to avoid infringing patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries  and intellectual property litigation may be used against us as a means of gaining a competitive advantage 
intellectual property litigation is complex  time consuming and expensive  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
if we were found to be infringing any third party patent or other intellectual property right  we could be required to pay significant damages  alter our products or processes  obtain licenses from others  which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or cease commercialization of our products and processes 
any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents patent litigation or certain other administrative proceedings may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
these activities could result in substantial cost to us  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome of any such litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using our technology 
any action to defend or prosecute intellectual property would be costly and result in significant diversion of the efforts of our management and technical personnel  regardless of outcome  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us 
we rely significantly upon proprietary technology  information  processes and know how that are not subject to patent protection 
we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  potential licensees  or other parties as well as through other security measures 
there can be no assurance that these agreements or any security measure will provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if we or any of our licensees breach any of the agreements under which we have in licensed intellectual property from others  we could be deprived of important intellectual property rights and future revenue 
we are a party to various agreements through which we have in licensed or otherwise acquired from third parties rights to certain technologies that are important to our business 
in exchange for the rights granted to us under these agreements  we agree to meet certain research  development  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  indemnification  insurance  and other obligations 
if we or one of our licensees fails to comply with these obligations set forth in the relevant agreement through which we have acquired rights  we may be unable to effectively use  license  or otherwise exploit the relevant intellectual property rights and may be deprived of current or future revenue that is associated with such intellectual property 
risks relating to clinical and regulatory matters healthcare policy changes  including new legislation intended to reform the us healthcare system  may have a material adverse effect on us 
healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade 
there have been and continue to be proposals by legislators  regulators  and third party payors to keep these costs down 
certain proposals  if implemented  would impose limitations on the prices our customers will be able to charge for our products  or the amounts of reimbursement available for their products from governmental agencies or third party payors 
because our revenue is typically derived from royalties on products which constitute a percentage of the selling price  these limitations could have an adverse effect on our revenue 
on march   the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law 
the legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers who make up a significant portion of our customers 
the legislation  if fully enacted  will have a significant total cost to the medical device industry  which could have a material  negative impact on both the financial condition of our customers as well as on our customers ability to attract financing  their willingness to commit capital to development projects or their ability to commercialize their products utilizing our technology  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there continues to be substantial risk to our customers  and therefore us  from the uncertainty which continues to surround the future of health care delivery and reimbursement both in the us and abroad 

table of contents products incorporating our technologies are subject to continuing regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes 
if our licensees are unable to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for such products  then our licensees will not be able to commercialize those products on a timely basis  if at all 
medical devices  biotechnology products or pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
in order to obtain regulatory approval for products incorporating our technologies  extensive preclinical studies as well as clinical trials in humans may be required 
clinical development  including preclinical testing  is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
the burden of securing regulatory approval for these products typically rests with our licensees  the medical device or pharmaceutical manufacturers 
however  we have prepared drug master files and device master files which may be accessed by the fda and other regulatory authorities to assist them in their review of the applications filed by our licensees 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and time consuming 
historically  most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fda s k marketing approval process  which typically lasts from six to nine months 
supplemental or full pre market approval reviews require a significantly longer period  delaying commercialization 
by contrast  pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fda s new drug application process  which typically takes a number of years to complete 
additionally  biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fda s biologics license application process  which also typically takes a number of years to complete 
in addition  sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products outside the us are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
there can be no assurance that our licensees will be able to obtain regulatory approval for their products on a timely basis  if at all 
regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
in addition  product approval could be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of products incorporating our technologies or subject us to additional regulation 
failure or delay of our licensees in obtaining fda and other necessary regulatory approval or clearance  or the loss of previously obtained approvals  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face liability if we mishandle or improperly dispose of the hazardous materials used in some of our research  development and manufacturing processes 
our research  development and manufacturing activities sometimes involve the controlled use of various hazardous materials 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
while we currently maintain insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate  we could be held liable for any damages that might result from any such event 
any such liability could exceed our insurance and available resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  certain of our activities are regulated by federal and state agencies in addition to the fda 
for example  activities in connection with disposal of certain chemical waste are subject to regulation by the us environmental protection agency 
we could be held liable in the event of improper disposal of such materials  even if these acts were done by third parties 
some of our reagent chemicals must be registered with the agency  with basic information filed related to toxicity during the manufacturing process as well as the toxicity of the final product 
failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risks relating to our securities our stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile  in large part attributable to developments and circumstances related to factors identified in forward looking statements and risk factors

overview surmodics is a leading provider of drug delivery and surface modification technologies to the healthcare industry 
as further discussed in item overview recent sale of pharmaceuticals business  in december we announced that the board of directors of the company had authorized the company to explore strategic alternatives for our pharmaceuticals business  including a potential sale of that business 
this decision by the board reflected our focus on returning the company to profitable growth  and our renewed commitment to pursuing growth opportunities and investments in our medical device and in vitro diagnostics businesses 
on november   we entered into a purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of surmodics pharmaceuticals to evonik 
the pharma sale closed on november  the total consideration received 
table of contents from the sale was million in cash 
of the total consideration  million was placed in escrow at closing for any inventory shortfall and the payment of certain contingent consideration obligations related to our acquisition of surmodics pharmaceuticals in july because the pharma sale closed subsequent to our fiscal year ended september   the discussion for all fiscal years includes our pharmaceuticals segment results as reported 
we will report the pharmaceuticals segment as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  we announced a change in our organizational structure moving from a functional structure into one consisting of three business units medical device  pharmaceuticals  and in vitro diagnostics 
we believe this structure improves the visibility  marketing and adoption of the company s broad array of technologies within specific markets and helps our customers in the medical device  pharmaceutical and life science industries better solve unmet clinical needs 
the october organizational change resulted in the company presenting revenue and operating results according to its three segments  as follows the medical device unit  which is comprised of surface modification coating technologies to improve access  deliverability  and predictable deployment of medical devices  as well as drug delivery coating technologies to provide site specific drug delivery from the surface of a medical device 
end markets include coronary  peripheral  and neuro vascular  and urology  among others  the pharmaceuticals unit  which incorporates a broad range of drug delivery technologies for injectable therapeutics  including microparticles  nanoparticles  and implants addressing a range of clinical applications including ophthalmology  oncology  dermatology and neurology  among others 
based in birmingham  alabama  the pharmaceuticals business includes our cgmp manufacturing facility  and the in vitro diagnostics unit  which consists of component products and technologies for diagnostic test kits and biomedical research applications 
products include microarray slide technologies  protein stabilization reagents  substrates  and antigens 
our revenue is derived from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our proprietary drug delivery and surface modification technologies and in vitro diagnostic formats to customers  the vast majority typically in excess of of revenue in the royalties and license fees category is in the form of royalties  the sale of polymers and reagent chemicals  stabilization products  antigens  substrates and microarray slides to the diagnostics and biomedical research industry  and research and development fees generated on customer projects 
revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our technologies  the timing of introductions of licensed products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers products  the number and activity level associated with customer development projects  the number and terms of new license agreements that are finalized  the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to customers  and the timing of future acquisitions we complete  if any 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we report our results for the three reportable segments noted above 
we made this determination based on how we manage our operations and the information provided to our chief operating decision maker who is our chief executive officer 
in june  we entered into a license and research collaboration agreement and separate supply agreement with merck related to our i vation ta intravitreal implant 
under the terms of the merck agreements  we received an upfront license fee of million and were eligible to receive up to an additional million in fees and development milestones associated with the successful product development and attainment of appropriate us and eu regulatory approvals  as well as payment for our research and development activities 
in september  following a strategic review of merck s business and product development portfolio  merck gave notice to surmodics that it was terminating the collaborative license and research agreement  as well as the supply agreement entered into in june this decision was not based on any concerns about the safety or efficacy of the i vation system 
the termination was effective in december  and we recognized revenue related to the termination of approximately million in fiscal  principally from amounts that previously had 
table of contents been deferred and amortized under the accounting treatment required by accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the million included a million milestone payment from merck associated with the termination of the triamcinolone acetonide development program 
overview of research and development activities we manage our customer sponsored r d programs customer r d  based largely on the requirements of our customers 
in this regard  our customers typically establish the various measures and metrics that are used to monitor a program s progress  including key deliverables  milestones  timelines  and an overall program budget 
the customer is ultimately responsible for deciding whether to continue or terminate a program  and does so based on research results relative to the above measures and metrics and other factors  including their own strategic and or business priorities 
customer r d programs are mainly in our medical device and pharmaceuticals segments and the processes do not differ significantly 
for our internal r d programs included in other r d in our three segments  we utilize r d review committees to prioritize these programs based on a number of factors  including a program s strategic fit  commercial impact  potential competitive advantage  technical feasibility  and the amount of investment required 
the measures and metrics used to monitor a program s progress varies based on the program  and typically includes many of the same factors discussed above with respect to our customer r d programs 
we typically make decisions to continue or terminate a program based on research results relative to the above measures and metrics and other factors  including our own strategic and or business priorities  and the amount of additional investment required 
with respect to cost components  r d expenses in each of our three segments consist of labor  materials and overhead costs utilities  depreciation  indirect labor  etc 
for both customer r d and other r d programs 
we manage our r d organization in a flexible manner  balancing workloads resources between customer r d and other r d programs primarily based on the level of customer program activity 
therefore  costs incurred for customer r d and other r d can shift as customer activity increases or decreases 
as a result of the recent economic conditions  some customers have delayed  slowed or cancelled development projects  which has affected the r d expense mix between customer r d and other r d 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements is based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following are critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with accounting guidance  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or delivery has occurred if the terms specify destination  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
when there are additional performance requirements  revenue is recognized when all such requirements have been satisfied 
under revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company recognizes each separable deliverable as it is earned 
the company licenses technology to third parties and collects royalties 
royalty revenue is generated when a customer sells products incorporating the company s licensed technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with the report 
for stand alone license agreements  up front license fees are recognized over the term of the related licensing agreement 
minimum royalty fees are recognized in the period earned 

table of contents revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone and meeting specific revenue recognition criteria 
product sales to third parties are recognized at the time of shipment  provided that an order has been received  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and returns can be reasonably estimated 
our sales terms provide no right of return outside of our standard warranty policy 
payment terms are generally set at days 
generally  revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables have been accounted for based on accounting guidance in existence at the time the arrangement commences 
prior to october   arrangements such as license and development agreements were analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and development  could be separated  or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with accounting guidance 
the company had one significant multiple element arrangement prior to october  that was accounted for as a single unit of accounting resulting in deferral and recognition of all related payments received for license and research and development activities using a time based model 
this arrangement was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal  on a prospective basis  for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after october  in connection with the adoption of the amended accounting standard we also changed our policy prospectively for multiple element arrangements  whereby we account for revenue using a multiple attribution model in which consideration allocated to research and development activities is recognized as performed  and milestone payments are recognized when the milestone events are achieved  when such activities and milestones are deemed substantive 
accordingly  in situations where a unit of accounting includes both a license and research and development activities  and when a license does not have stand alone value  the company applies a multiple attribution model in which consideration allocated to the license is recognized ratably  consideration allocated to research and development activities is recognized as performed and milestone payments are recognized when the milestone events are achieved  when such activities and milestones are deemed substantive 
the company enters into license and development arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables which could include a license s to surmodics technology  research and development activities  manufacturing services  and product sales based on the needs of its customers 
for example  a customer may enter into an arrangement to obtain a license to surmodics intellectual property which may also include research and development activities  and supply of products manufactured by surmodics 
for these services provided  surmodics could receive upfront license fees upon signing of an agreement and granting the license  fees for research and development activities as such activities are performed  milestone payments contingent upon advancement of the product through development and clinical stages to successful commercialization  fees for manufacturing services and supply of product  and royalty payments based on customer sales of product incorporating surmodics technology 
our license and development arrangements generally do not have refund provisions if the customer cancels or terminates the agreement 
typically all payments made are non refundable 

table of contents under the accounting guidance  we are still required to evaluate each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement for separability 
we are then required to allocate revenue to each separate deliverable using a hierarchy of vsoe  tpe  or esp 
in many instances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements which may be a result of surmodics infrequently selling each element separately or having a limited history with multiple element arrangements 
when vsoe cannot be established  surmodics attempts to establish a selling price of each element based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which surmodics would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
esp is generally used for highly customized offerings 
surmodics determines esp for undelivered elements by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  market conditions  competitive landscape and past pricing arrangements with similar features 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with the company s management  taking into consideration the marketing strategies for each business unit 
costs related to products and services delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized except for services related to the merck agreement  which were recognized as incurred 
customer advances are accounted for as a liability until all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
valuation of long lived assets 
accounting guidance requires us to periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangibles 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges were less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment charge to reduce such assets to their fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized asset impairment charges totaling million associated with our pharmaceuticals segment 
we wrote down long lived assets fixed assets of million and intangibles of million  associated with our pharmaceuticals segment  based on the current valuation of the assets relative to their carrying value 
the company had been exploring strategic alternatives for the pharmaceuticals segment  including a potential sale 
the assets of the pharmaceuticals business did not qualify as held for sale as of september   because we had not committed to a plan to sell at that time 
however  our assessment of options available as of september  resulted in a probability weighted value of expected future cash flows below the carrying value of these assets  which required us to determine the fair value of the long lived assets of the pharmaceuticals segment using the probability weighted value of the expected future cash flows 
asset impairment charges of million were recognized based on this assessment 
subsequently  the company sold substantially all of its pharmaceuticals assets for million on november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sale of surmodics pharmaceuticals 
in fiscal  we recognized asset impairment charges totaling million 
we wrote down facility related assets in alabama by million to their fair value based on a decision to sell the assets  however based on further analysis of various factors associated with the consolidation of facilities we later decided not to sell the facility 
the carrying value of the facility was million at september   which was based on a real estate appraisal obtained during our negotiations 
we also wrote down certain project and technology related assets totaling million  as there were no ongoing business opportunities expected in light of current market conditions and general economic environment 
surmodics also recognized a charge of million associated with certain construction in progress fixed assets in minnesota  given the level of business activity and overall economic conditions 
each of these events included analysis of expected future cash flows or real estate market 
table of contents data which was compared with the carrying values of the assets to determine the impairment charges that were recognized 
the assets associated with these charges had limited remaining value and as such were written down to zero value at september  goodwill 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  at fair value as required by accounting guidance for business combinations 
the initial recognition of goodwill requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment in accordance with accounting guidance for goodwill 
under certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
evaluating goodwill for impairment in fiscal was based on new goodwill accounting guidance which was early adopted by surmodics in the fourth quarter of fiscal the new accounting guidance involves assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test becomes unnecessary 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis 
we have determined that our reporting units are our surmodics pharmaceuticals subsidiary  the in vitro diagnostics operations known as our in vitro diagnostics reporting unit which contains the biofx branded products  and the surmodics drug delivery and hydrophilic coatings operations known as our medical device business unit 
the reporting units with goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of surmodics pharmaceuticals and surmodics ivd in fiscal inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
the million of goodwill at september  is related to the in vitro diagnostics reporting unit 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august   and did not record any goodwill impairment charges as there were no indicators of impairment associated with the in vitro diagnostics reporting unit 
we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal associated with our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit 
two milestone events were achieved associated with the july acquisition of surmodics pharmaceuticals and million of additional purchase price was recorded as an increase to goodwill 
during our annual test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined the goodwill related to our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit was fully impaired and we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
there had been no substantial changes in operating results for surmodics pharmaceuticals in the first quarter of fiscal when compared with fiscal  and as such we concluded that the goodwill associated with the milestone events was fully impaired 
prior to testing goodwill for impairment in fiscal  we tested our definite lived assets  property and equipment as well as intangible assets  under the provisions of the accounting guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and determined that there were no impairments of these assets 
the goodwill impairment in fiscal reflected a significant decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units  mainly our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit  which resulted from a slowdown in 
table of contents business activity which was most pronounced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  higher operating costs with our cgmp manufacturing facility  and a significant decrease in our stock price during fiscal our stock price declined from per share at october  to per share at the date of our annual impairment test  which was august  while we continually evaluated whether any indications of impairment are present that would require an impairment analysis on an interim basis  no such indicators were considered present prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to the fourth quarter  based on our outlook for future results and the fact that our market capitalization exceeded our book value by a margin of at june   we did not believe that the events and circumstances in existence at our interim reporting dates indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units would be less than its carrying amount 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired in fiscal  we compared the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying values step of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value  with the market approach used as a test of reasonableness 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the market approach establishes fair value by comparing our company to other publicly traded guideline companies or by analysis of actual transactions of similar businesses or assets sold 
the income approach is tailored to the circumstances of our business  and the market approach is completed as a secondary test to ensure that the results of the income approach are reasonable and in line with comparable companies in the industry 
the summation of our reporting units fair values was compared and reconciled to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
in the situation where a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the measurement of the impairment step of the impairment test is calculated by determining the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit under the income approach  the expected cash flows of surmodics pharmaceuticals were affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis used forecasts over a ten year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we used our business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
the most significant assumptions incorporated in these forecasts for the fiscal goodwill impairment test included annual revenue changes based on then current customer programs and expected progression of these programs into different phases of development 
a discount rate of was used in the fiscal analysis to reflect the relevant risks of the higher growth assumed for this reporting unit 
given the significant difference between the reporting unit s fair value and carrying value  any change in the discount rate would not have changed the evaluation of impairment 
in estimating the fiscal fair value of our company under the market approach  we considered the relative merits of commonly applied market capitalization multiples based on the availability of data 
based on our analysis  we utilized the guideline public company method to support the valuation of the reporting units in fiscal based on the goodwill analysis performed as of august   the million of goodwill in the surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit failed step of the impairment test  and step of the impairment test indicated that goodwill was fully impaired 
the indicated excess in fair value over carrying value of the company s in vitro diagnostics reporting unit in step of the impairment test at august  was approximately and as such the million of goodwill related to this reporting unit was not impaired 
to the extent that actual results or other assumptions about future economic conditions or potential for our growth and profitability in this business changed  it is possible that our conclusion regarding the goodwill could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the surmodics drug 
table of contents delivery and hydrophilic coatings operations do not have any goodwill and were included in the fiscal analysis to assist in reconciling the fair value of all reporting units to the company s market capitalization at august  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges during fiscal investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities and are classified as available for sale or held to maturity at september  our investment policy calls for no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
our evaluation of the available for sale investments resulted in no loss recognition in fiscal  or investments for which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
if there was an other than temporary impairment in the fair value of any individual security classified as held to maturity  the company would write down the security to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other income loss 
interest on debt securities  including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  is included in other income loss 
realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities  which are included in other income loss  are determined using the specific identification method 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income tax obligations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years  for which we have already recorded the expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we had total deferred tax assets in excess of total deferred tax liabilities of million as of september  and million as of september   including valuation allowances of million as of september  and million as of september  the valuation allowances related to impairment losses on investments were recorded because the company does not currently foresee future capital gains within the allowable carryforward and carryback periods to offset these capital losses when they are recognized 
as such  no tax benefit has been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we recorded a valuation allowance related to state net operating losses based on the uncertainty regarding the realization of the net operating losses in the carryforward periods 
the company adopted accounting provisions on october  which defined new standards for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax 
table of contents benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of september   and was million  million and million  respectively  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
of these unrecognized tax benefits  million  million and million would affect our effective tax rate for fiscal  and  respectively 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of september   and  million  million and million  respectively  of interest and penalties were accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
the internal revenue service irs commenced an examination of our us income tax return for fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal the irs completed an examination of our us income tax return for fiscal and a payment was made in the third quarter of fiscal associated with timing adjustments 
us income tax returns for fiscal and remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities 
tax returns for state and local jurisdictions for fiscal years through remain subject to examination by state and local tax authorities 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or local jurisdiction  all years remain subject to examination by the tax authorities 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
within the next months  we do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding changes in unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal  and use of non gaap financial information 
in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with gaap  this report includes certain non gaap financial results including non gaap operating income or loss 
we believe these non gaap measures provide meaningful insight into our operating performance  excluding certain event specific charges  and provide an alternative perspective of our results of operations 
we use non gaap measures  including certain of those set forth in this report  to assess our operating performance and to determine payout under our executive compensation programs 
we believe that presentation of certain non gaap measures allows investors to review our results of operations from the same perspective as management and our board of directors and facilitates comparisons of our current results of operations 
the method we use to produce non gaap results is not in accordance with gaap and may differ from the methods used by other companies 
non gaap results should not be regarded as a substitute for corresponding gaap measures but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of operating performance in evaluating our business 
non gaap measures do have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
as such  these non gaap measures presented should be viewed in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
results of operations years ended september  and in thousands fiscal fiscal increase decrease change revenue medical device pharmaceuticals in vitro diagnostics total revenue revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal the above table provides a summary of each operating segment s revenue with the narrative that follows providing additional explanations 

table of contents medical device 
revenue in medical device was million in fiscal  an decrease compared with million in the prior year period 
the decrease in total revenue reflected lower license fees and royalties as well as lower r d revenue  partially offset by higher product sales 
fiscal included million in license fee revenue that was one time in nature 
in fiscal  we had a million decrease  or  in royalty revenue from cordis  compared with the prior year period 
growth of approximately in royalty revenue from our hydrophilic coating license agreements was not strong enough to offset the decrease in royalty revenue from cordis 
as we have disclosed in previous filings  medical device has derived a substantial amount of revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics polymer coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
the cypher stent faces continuing competition from boston scientific  medtronic  and abbott 
in june  cordis announced the cessation of the manufacture of the cypher and cypher select plus stents by the end of in july  cordis notified the company of its intention to terminate the exclusivity arrangements under the license agreement  which also results in a termination of the minimum quarterly royalty requirements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal for the last several years  royalty revenue and reagent product sales have decreased as a result of lower cypher stent sales  and we had anticipated that royalty revenue from cypher stents would continue to decrease in fiscal until it reached minimum royalty levels per the license agreement with cordis 
the decline in cypher stent sales in fiscal resulted in surmodics recognizing minimum quarterly royalty income of million for the third and fourth quarters per the terms of our license agreement with cordis 
beginning with our first quarter of fiscal  since the minimum royalty requirements have been eliminated  royalties under the license agreement will be based on a percentage of cypher sales  if any 
pharmaceuticals 
pharmaceuticals revenue was million in fiscal  a decrease of compared with million in the prior year period 
the decrease principally reflected lower license fee revenue  as one customer achieved a milestone event in fiscal  as well as lower r d revenue 
in vitro diagnostics 
in vitro diagnostics revenue was million in fiscal  an increase of  compared with million in the prior year period 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of our biofx branded products as well as our stabilization and antigen products 
product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  a decrease from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  compared with in the prior year 
the increase in product margins reflected the mix of products sold in fiscal  as there were higher levels of diagnostic and reagent product sales compared with prior year results

in fiscal we recognized an inventory impairment charge totaling million 
the gross margin for fiscal  when adjusting for this impairment  was 
customer research and development expenses 
customer r d expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the impact of higher fixed overhead costs attributable to our alabama research and development operations  offset somewhat by lower project material costs

overhead allocated to other r d also declined based on the 
table of contents lower headcount levels 
we also had a reduction of million in other r d expenses in our pharmaceuticals business  compared with fiscal expenses  based on a decision to limit its internal r d activities in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects higher variable compensation costs of million 
restructuring charges 
in august  we announced a realignment of our business to optimize the company s resources according to our strategic plan 
as a result of the organizational change  we eliminated approximately of our workforce 
these employee terminations occurred across various functions  and the reorganization plan was completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded total pre tax restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which consisted of severance pay and benefits expenses 
in october  we announced initiatives to reduce our cost structure and renew our focus on business units to more closely match operations and cost structure with the current customer environment 
as a result of the organizational change  we eliminated positions  or approximately of our workforce 
these employee terminations occurred across various functions  and the reorganization plan was completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the reorganization also resulted in surmodics vacating a leased production facility in birmingham  alabama and relocating the production activities to one of our owned facilities in birmingham 
we recorded total pre tax restructuring charges of million in the first quarter of fiscal  which consisted of million of severance pay and benefits expenses and less than million of facility related costs

cumulative costs totaling million have been paid associated with the fiscal  and restructurings  and we anticipate paying the remaining million within the next months  with the majority in the next months 
asset impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized asset impairment charges totaling million 
we wrote down long lived assets fixed assets of million and intangibles of million  associated with our pharmaceuticals segment  based on the current valuation of the assets relative to their carrying value 
the company had been exploring strategic alternatives for the pharmaceuticals segment  including a potential sale 
the assets of the pharmaceuticals business did not qualify as held for sale as of september   because we had not committed to a plan to sell at that time 
however  our assessment of options available as of september  resulted in a probability weighted value of expected future cash flows below the carrying value of these assets  which required us to determine the fair value of the long lived assets of the pharmaceuticals segment using the probability weighted value of the expected future cash flows 
asset impairment charges of million were recognized based on this assessment 
subsequently  the company sold substantially all of its pharmaceuticals assets for million on november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sale of surmodics pharmaceuticals 

table of contents in fiscal  we recorded a million asset impairment charge associated with writing down one of our facilities in alabama to fair value based on a decision to sell the facility  which we later determined not to sell 
the million carrying value of this facility was based on a real estate market appraisal obtained during our negotiations 
we also recorded a million asset impairment charge in fiscal associated with certain long lived assets where no ongoing business was expected in the foreseeable future based on market conditions 
furthermore  we recorded a million asset impairment charge associated with certain fixed asset costs located in minnesota and a million asset impairment charge associated with prototypes and other equipment related to a development project for which no ongoing business was expected in the foreseeable future in light of market conditions 
the assets associated with these charges had limited remaining value and as such were written down to zero value 
goodwill impairment charges 
we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal associated with our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit 
two milestone events were achieved associated with the july acquisition of surmodics pharmaceuticals and million of additional purchase price was recorded as an increase to goodwill 
there had been no substantial changes in operating results for surmodics pharmaceuticals in the first quarter of fiscal when compared with fiscal  and as such we concluded that the goodwill associated with the milestone events was fully impaired 
in fiscal  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge associated with our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment charge in fiscal reflected a significant decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units  mainly our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit  which resulted from a slowdown in business activity most pronounced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  higher operating costs with our cgmp manufacturing facility  and a significant decrease in our stock price during fiscal our stock price declined from per share at october  to per share at the date of our annual impairment test  which was august  we continually evaluated whether any indications of impairment were present that would require an impairment analysis on an interim basis 
prior to the fourth quarter  based on our outlook for future results and the fact that our market capitalization exceeded our book value by a margin of at june   we did not believe that the events and circumstances in existence at our interim reporting dates indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units would be less than its carrying amount 
other income loss  net 
other income was million in fiscal  compared with a loss of million in fiscal income from investments was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower yields generated from our investment portfolio in fiscal the fiscal loss primarily reflects a total of million of impairment losses in connection with our portfolio of strategic investments

in addition  we recognized a million loss on our investment in a medical technology company in the third quarter of fiscal based on market valuations and a pending financing round for this company 
another entity in which the company had a strategic investment sold the majority of its assets in the third quarter of fiscal resulting in an impairment loss of million 
income tax benefit provision 
the income tax benefit was million in fiscal  compared with an income tax provision of million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was  and when excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge of million  the rate was 
the fiscal effective tax rate is not meaningful because a tax expense was recorded on a pre tax loss 
the fiscal effective tax rate  when excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge of million and impairment losses on investments of million  was since we do not currently foresee offsetting capital gains that could offset these capital losses  and therefore no benefit was recorded 
the decrease in the effective tax rate  adjusted for the one time items noted  is primarily a result of lower state taxes resulting from adjustments to state deferred taxes

investing activities 
in fiscal  we invested million in capital expenditures compared with million in fiscal the majority of the fiscal capital expenditures were for our cgmp facility in birmingham  alabama

we have invested an additional million through fiscal in this facility  to meet the development and cgmp manufacturing needs of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers 
we also made milestone payments of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal associated with the july surmodics pharmaceuticals acquisition 
subsequent to fiscal  we completed the pharma sale for million in cash 
we believe the company has sufficient cash and investments on hand as of september   which totaled million  to finance foreseeable future needs 
financing activities 
in fiscal  our financing activities were primarily associated with stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  our financing activities were driven by common stock repurchases 
in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the 
table of contents company s common stock in open market transactions  private transactions  tender offers  or other transactions 
the repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration date 
during fiscal  we purchased  shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share 
there were no repurchases of common stock in fiscal under the repurchase authorization 
under the current authorization  the company has million remaining available for authorized share repurchases as of september  in february  we extended our unsecured revolving credit facility through march and reduced the credit facility to million 
borrowings under the credit facility  if any  will bear interest at a benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
no borrowings have yet been made on the credit facility 
in connection with the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants 
as of september   the company had no debt outstanding under the credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
we do not have any other credit agreements and believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with cash flow from operations  will provide liquidity sufficient to meet the below stated needs and fund our operations for the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that surmodics business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels  and disruptions in financial markets may negatively impact the company s ability to access capital in a timely manner and on attractive terms 
our anticipated liquidity needs for fiscal may include  but are not limited to  the following general capital expenditures in the range of million to million  contingent consideration payments  if any  related to our acquisitions of surmodics pharmaceuticals and surmodics ivd as well as the purchase of certain assets from pr pharma  and any amounts associated with the repurchase of common stock under the authorization discussed above 
customer concentrations 
our licensed technologies provide royalty revenue  which represents the largest revenue stream to the company 
we have licenses with a diverse base of customers and certain customers have multiple products using our technology 
medtronic is our largest customer at of total revenue in fiscal medtronic has several separately licensed products that generate royalty revenue for surmodics 
in addition  there has been a decline in royalty revenue from one of our largest customers  cordis  and with their june announcement of the cessation of the manufacture of the cypher and cypher select plus stents by the end of  our royalty stream from this customer reached the contractual million minimum quarterly level per the agreement in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal beyond fiscal  since the minimum levels in the agreement have been eliminated  we expect an earned royalty amount based on a percentage of cypher sales  if any  until the products are no longer sold 
no other individual customer product using licensed technology constitutes more than of surmodics total revenue 
further  our licensing agreements with many of our customers  including most of our significant customers  cover many licensed products that each separately generate royalty revenue 
this situation reduces the potential risk to our operations that may result from reduced sales or the termination of a license of a single product for any specific customer 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 
as of september   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated entities 
presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and payments due by period in thousands 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the below obligations 
total less than year years years more than years operating leases other long term liabilities total other long term liability contractual obligations primarily relate to payments associated with terminated operating leases as part of our restructuring activities in fiscal and a long term minimum usage incentive with a utility company 
the long term minimum usage incentive liability was assumed by evonik in connection with the pharma sale 

table of contents as of september   our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was million 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required 
therefore  these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations above 
in addition  we may be required to pay additional cash or stock consideration of up to million related to business acquisitions  contingent on future achievement of certain development or business objectives of the acquired businesses 
the timing and amounts are uncertain  thus we are not able to reasonably estimate whether settlement of the contingent liability will be required 
therefore  these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations above 
new accounting pronouncements 
in september  the fasb issued changes to existing goodwill impairment testing guidance and permitted early adoption 
the new accounting guidance involves assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then moving to the next phase  the two step impairment test  is unnecessary 
we elected to early adopt the new guidance for our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal in june  the fasb issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income 
these changes give an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity was eliminated 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
these changes become effective for us on october  fiscal 
management is currently evaluating these changes to determine which option will be chosen for the presentation of comprehensive income 
other than the change in presentation  management has determined these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued changes to conform existing guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
these changes both clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and amend certain principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the clarifying changes relate to the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity  and disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used for level fair value measurements 
the amendments relate to measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and additional disclosures concerning the valuation processes used and sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs for those items categorized as level  a reporting entity s use of a nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the asset s highest and best use  and the categorization by level in the fair value hierarchy for items required to be measured at fair value for disclosure purposes only 
these changes become effective for us on january  fiscal 
management is currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes on the consolidated financial statements 
no other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective has had  or is expected to have  a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment policy requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate and municipal debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
surmodics does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale and held to maturity securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because the company s inventory exposure is not material 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
