the eleven bank subsidiaries provide commercial services to individuals  small to medium size businesses  community organizations and public entities from locations  including branches  across montana  idaho  wyoming  colorado  utah  and washington 
the rocky mountain areas in which the bank subsidiaries operate have diverse economies and markets that are tied to commodities crops  livestock  minerals  oil and natural gas  tourism  real estate and land development and an assortment of industries  both manufacturing and service related 
thus  the downturn in the global  national  and local economies is not uniform across each of the bank subsidiaries 

table of contents the soft economic conditions during much of  though stabilized during  included the declining sales of existing real property eg  single family residential  multi family  commercial buildings and land  an increase in existing inventory of real property  increase in real property delinquencies and foreclosures  and corresponding decrease in absorption rates  and lower values of real property that collateralize most of the company s loan and lease portfolios  among other factors 
while national unemployment increased steadily from percent at the start of to percent at year end and dropping to at december   the unemployment rates for the states in which the community bank subsidiaries conduct operations were significantly lower throughout and than the national unemployment percentages 
agricultural price declines in livestock and grain in have significantly recovered in concurrently  prices for oil held strong  while prices for natural gas remain below the exceptionally high price levels of the decline in the cost of living  as reflected in cpi measures  helped buffer the general softening of the economy nationally  regionally and locally  and the impact of lower real property values 
the tourism industry and related lodging continues to be a source of strength for those banks whose market areas have national parks and similar recreational areas in the market areas served 
such changes affected the bank subsidiaries in distinctly different ways as each bank has its own geographic area and local economy influences over both a short term and long term horizon 
the specific allowance allocation of million pertains to total impaired loans of million 
included in the impaired loans is million of loans which have no specific allowance allocation since the fair value of collateral dependent loans or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate is higher than the carrying value of such impaired loans 
in determining the need for a specific allowance allocation on impaired loans  the effects of decreases during in the fair value of the underlying collateral were considered 
in evaluating the need for a specific or general valuation allowance for impaired and unimpaired loans  respectively  within the company s construction loan portfolio  including residential construction and land  lot and other construction loans  the credit risk related to such loans was considered in the ongoing monitoring of such loans  including assessments based on current information  including new or updated appraisals or evaluations of the underlying collateral  expected cash flows and the timing thereof  as well as the estimated costs to sell when such costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the construction loan 
construction loans are of the company s total loan portfolio and account for of the company s non accrual loans at december  collateral securing construction loans include residential buildings eg  single multi family and condominiums  commercial buildings  and associated land multi acre parcels and individual lots  with and without shorelines 
outstanding balances are centered in western montana and northern idaho  as well as boise  ketchum and sun valley  idaho 
none of the individual bank subsidiaries have a concentration of constructions loans exceeding of the company s total loan portfolio 
as identified below  the following four bank subsidiaries had non accrual construction loans that aggregated percent or more of the company s million of non accrual construction loans at december  also identified below are the principal areas of the bank subsidiaries operations in which the collateral properties of such non accrual construction loans are located mountain west percent northern idaho and boise and sun valley  idaho glacier percent western montana first security percent western montana big sky percent western montana residential non accrual construction loans are percent of the total construction loans on non accrual status as of year end unimproved land and land development loans collectively account for the bulk of the non accrual commercial construction loans at each of the four bank subsidiaries 
with locations and operations in the contiguous northern rocky mountain states of idaho and montana  the geography and economies of each of the four bank subsidiaries are predominantly tied to real estate development given the sprawling abundance of timbered valleys and mountainous terrain with significant lakes  streams and watershed areas 
consistent with the general economic downturn  the market for upscale primary  secondary and other housing as well as the associated construction and building industries have stalled after years of significant growth 
as the housing market rental and owner occupied and related industries continue to recover from the downturn  the company continues to reduce its exposure to loss in the construction loan and other segments of the total loan portfolio
