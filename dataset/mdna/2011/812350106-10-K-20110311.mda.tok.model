the retail industry is highly competitive and as such  holdings faces significant challenges  including the current macroeconomic environment  as many of our product categories are impacted by the housing market and availability of credit to our customers 
the retail industry is also rapidly evolving as retail is increasingly impacted by new technologies and social media 
we believe that this evolution provides us with significant growth opportunities  if we are able to transform our portfolio of businesses by leveraging our existing store network with emerging technologies to develop lasting relationships with our customers 
over the past months  we have worked hard to improve our stores  while also taking steps to reposition ourselves for retail in the st century 
our existing store base is a significant asset  as our  stores provide us with a physical presence in almost all major communities in the united states and canada 
we have been working to improve our existing stores in a number of ways 
first and foremost  we are using technology to transform our store experiences and we continue to innovate as an integrated retailer  offering our customers a seamless experience across channels under the shop your way banner 
shop your way represents our commitment to providing our customers the opportunity to buy whatever they want  wherever they want and whenever they want

third  our efforts to improve basic store execution produced nearly double digit increases in our customer service scores year over year at both sears and kmart 
improving our store experience is just one part of becoming the preferred destination for our customers 
we have focused much of our efforts in emerging areas of retail  like our rewards program and our online platforms

comparable store sales results for were calculated based on the week period ended january  compared to net income attributable to holdings shareholders we recorded net income attributable to holdings shareholders of million per diluted share for and million per diluted share in our results for and were affected by a number of significant items 
our net income  as adjusted for these significant items was million per diluted share for and million per diluted share for the decrease in net income for the year reflects a decrease in operating income of million  primarily due to a decline in gross margin  due to lower overall revenues  partially offset by a decline in selling and administrative expenses 
in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures in assessing our operating performance 
we believe gaap measures as adjusted serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business and we adjust incentive compensation metrics for our executive management team for these same items 
furthermore  we believe our use of gaap measures as adjusted  including diluted income per share as adjusted  provides an appropriate measure to use in assessing our performance across periods  given that this measure provides an adjustment for certain significant items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on the earnings we report for a given period 
accordingly  we consider the aggregate impact of these items  along with reported results  in reviewing and evaluating our financial performance 
however  we do not  and do not recommend that you solely use gaap measures as adjusted to assess our financial performance or to formulate investment decisions  as the measures may exclude a number of important cash and non cash recurring items 
the following tables set forth results of operations on a gaap and as adjusted basis  as well as the impact each significant item had on specific income and expense amounts reported in our consolidated statements of income during years  and fiscal year ended january  millions  except per share data gaap domestic pension expense mark to market losses closed store reserve and severance gain on sale of real estate canadian dividend tax impact tax matters as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact gain on sales of assets impact operating income impact other loss impact income tax expense impact noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted income per share impact fiscal year ended january  millions  except per share data gaap domestic pension expense mark to market gains closed store reserve and severance gain on sale of sears canada headquarters visa mastercard settlement tax matters as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact gain on sales of assets impact operating income impact other loss impact income tax expense impact noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted income per share impact fiscal year ended january  millions  except per share data gaap impairments mark to market gains closed store reserve and severance legal settlement repurchase of debt securities tax matters as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact impairment charges impact operating income impact interest expense impact other income impact income tax expense impact noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted income per share impact contributions to our pension plans remain a significant use of our cash on an annual basis

our board of directors has delegated authority to direct investment of our surplus cash to our chairman  edward s 
lampert  subject to various limitations that have been or may be from time to time adopted by the board of directors and or finance committee of the board of directors 
operating activities and cash flows holdings generated million in operating cash flows during and billion in as a retailer  holdings primary source of operating cash flows is the sales of goods and services to customers  while the primary use of cash in operations is to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories 
the decrease in operating cash flows in is mainly the result of higher working capital balances  increased pension and postretirement contributions  as well as decreased net income 
holdings generated billion in operating cash flows during and million in the increase in net operating cash flows generated during primarily reflects increases in cash from working capital  as well as increased net income 
merchandise inventories increased million to billion at january  from billion at january  the increase was primarily in the kmart apparel  electronics  toys  footwear and sporting goods categories 
inventory levels at sears canada increased approximately million primarily due to the change in exchange rates  lower sales and the timing of merchandise receipts 
merchandise payables were billion at january  and billion at january  the decrease in merchandise payables is reflective of reduced inventory receipts at the end of due to lower sales at sears domestic

capital expenditures during included ongoing investments in the maintenance of the company s facilities including a significant investment in lighting retrofit projects to reduce energy consumption in holdings facilities and in information technology 
we anticipate capital expenditure levels to increase as compared to levels  due to investment in information technology upgrades and ongoing investment in the infrastructure of our facilities 
it should be noted that in the normal course of business  we consider opportunities to purchase leased operating properties  as well as offers to sell owned  or assign leased  operating and non operating properties 
these transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  result in material proceeds or outlays of cash and cause our capital expenditure levels to vary from period to period 
in addition  we review leases that will expire in the short term in order to determine the appropriate action to take with respect to them 
during  we purchased previously leased operating properties for million 
we did not make any such purchases in or during  we received million in cash from changes in investments and restricted cash 
this reflects cash received from the reserve primary fund of million  as well as changes in restricted cash requirements at sears canada

repayments of debt during were million 
total short term borrowings at january  of million were million higher than our level of borrowings at january  the increase in outstanding long term debt includes an increase in domestic long term debt and capital lease obligations of billion 
of this amount  million is due in  of which million was paid in february repayments of debt during were million and million in in  we took the following steps to enhance our liquidity position and reduce reliance on our domestic revolving credit facility during the peak holiday borrowing period on september   our sears canada subsidiary entered into a five year million canadian credit facility 
the facility is secured by a first lien on sears canada s inventory and receivable balances 
at january   sears canada had drawn approximately million million canadian on the facility and including letters of credit  had a remaining capacity of approximately million million canadian 
on september   sears holdings and sears canada executed an inter company loan whereby sears holdings borrowed million from sears canada 
sears holdings used the loan proceeds to fund its seasonal working capital build for the holiday selling season  thereby reducing borrowings on its credit facility 
the inter company loan was repaid in full to sears canada on november  on october   sears holdings issued billion of senior secured notes due these notes are secured by domestic inventory and credit card accounts receivable 
all of these steps taken during extend the duration of our capital structure  while at the same time allowing us to fund operations  continue to invest in our businesses  repurchase our stock  make payments on our term debt and complete our acquisition of additional noncontrolling interest in sears canada 
we repurchased million  million and million of our common stock pursuant to our common share repurchase program in  and  respectively 
the common share repurchase program was initially announced in and has a total authorization since inception of the program of billion 
at january   we had approximately million of remaining authorization under the program 
the share repurchase program has no stated expiration date and share repurchases may be implemented using a variety of methods  which may include open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  block trades  accelerated share repurchase transactions  the purchase of call options  the sale of put options or otherwise  or by any combination of such methods 
uses and sources of liquidity our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our retail businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes  including debt repayment  pension plan contributions and common share repurchases 
we believe that these needs will be adequately funded by our operating cash flows  credit terms received from vendors and borrowings under our credit agreements described below 
at january   billion was available under our domestic credit facility and million under sears canada s credit facility 
our year end and outstanding borrowings were as follows millions january  january  short term borrowings unsecured commercial paper secured borrowings long term debt  including current portion notes and debentures outstanding capitalized lease obligations total borrowings in  the finance committee of our board of directors authorized the repurchase  subject to market conditions and other factors  of up to million of our outstanding indebtedness in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the source of funds for the purchases is our cash from operations or borrowings under the credit agreement 
our wholly owned finance subsidiary  sears roebuck acceptance corp 
srac  has repurchased million of its outstanding notes  including million repurchased during and million repurchased during  thereby reducing the unused balance of this authorization to million 
we recognized a gain of million on the repurchases made during certain of our debt is variable rate and we therefore manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
at both january  and january   we had interest rate derivatives with notional amounts of million and nominal fair values 
debt ratings our corporate family debt rating at january  appear in the table below moody s investors service standard poor s ratings services fitch ratings ba bb b domestic credit agreement we have a billion domestic credit agreement the domestic credit agreement in place as a funding source for general corporate purposes 
the domestic credit agreement includes a billion letter of credit sub limit and an accordion feature that gives us the flexibility  subject to certain terms and conditions  to increase the size of the credit facility  or add a term loan tranche to the domestic credit agreement  in an aggregate amount of up to billion 
the domestic credit agreement  which has an expiration date of june  is an asset based revolving credit facility under which srac and kmart corporation are the borrowers 
the domestic credit agreement is secured by a first lien on most of our domestic inventory and credit card and pharmacy receivables  and determines availability pursuant to a borrowing base formula 
we are currently discussing with our advisors alternatives to extend or replace our domestic credit facility 
the domestic credit agreement limits our ability to make restricted payments  including dividends and share repurchases  if availability under the credit facility  as defined  is less than during the holiday period  which is defined as october to december 
it also imposes various other requirements which take effect if availability falls below designated thresholds  including a cash dominion requirement and a requirement that the fixed charge ratio at the last day of any quarter be not less than to we have also agreed to limit the amount of cash accumulated when borrowings are outstanding under the domestic credit agreement 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under the domestic credit agreement 
we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the domestic credit agreement 
as a result  our availability under the agreement was billion at january  the majority of the letters of credit outstanding are used to provide collateral for our insurance programs 
senior secured notes in october  we sold billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes the notes  which bear interest at per annum and mature on october  concurrent with the closing of the sale of the notes  the company sold million aggregate principal amount of notes to the company s domestic pension plan in a private placement 
the notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company and are secured by a security interest in certain assets consisting primarily of domestic inventory and credit card receivables the collateral 
the lien that secures the notes is junior in priority to the lien on such assets that secures obligations under the domestic credit agreement  as well as certain other first priority lien obligations 
the company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under the domestic credit agreement on the settlement date and to fund the working capital requirements of our retail businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
the indenture under which the notes were issued contains restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and limit the ability of the company to consolidate with or merge into  or sell other than for cash or lease all or substantially all of its assets to  another person 
the indenture also provides for certain events of default  which  if any occur  would permit or require the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the then outstanding notes to be due and payable immediately 
generally  the company is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount if the borrowing base as calculated pursuant to the indenture falls below the principal value of the notes plus any other indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by liens on the collateral for two consecutive quarters or upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events 
the company may call the notes at a premium based on the treasury rate as defined in the indenture  plus basis points 
we have agreed to offer to exchange the notes held by nonaffiliates for a new issue of substantially identical notes registered under the securities act of  as amended 
sears canada credit agreement in september  sears canada entered into a five year  million canadian senior secured revolving credit facility the sears canada facility 
the sears canada facility is available for sears canada s general corporate purposes and is secured by a first lien on substantially all of sears canada s non real estate assets 
availability under the sears canada facility is determined pursuant to a borrowing base formula based on inventory and account and credit card receivables  subject to certain limitations 
at january   we had approximately million million canadian of borrowings outstanding under the sears canada facility and classified these borrowings as long term debt as we do not intend to repay outstanding amounts within the next twelve months

the lc facility has a term ending on january   unless terminated sooner pursuant to its terms 
wells fargo may  in it sole discretion  terminate the lc facility at any time 
the lc facility enables us to more cost effectively obtain letters of credit when surplus cash is available to collateralize the letters of credit 
on january   million of letters of credit were outstanding from the facility 
we may replace our letters of credit issued under our lc facility with letters of credit issued under the domestic credit facility in the future and as such  cash collateral is considered unrestricted cash 
benefit and pension plan obligations contributions to our pension plans remain a significant use of our cash on an annual basis 
while sears holdings pension plan is frozen  and thus associates do not currently earn pension benefits  the company has a legacy pension obligation for past service performed by kmart and sears  roebuck and co 
associates 
during  we contributed million to our domestic pension plan 
we estimate that the domestic pension contribution will be approximately million in and million in  though the ultimate amount of pension contributions could be affected by further changes in the applicable regulation and financial market and investment performance 
wholly owned insurance subsidiary and inter company notes as noted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have numerous types of insurable risks  including workers compensation  product and general liability  automobile  warranty  and asbestos and environmental claims 
in addition  as discussed in note  we sell extended service contracts to our customers 
the associated risks are managed through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
in accordance with applicable insurance regulations  the insurance subsidiary holds investment grade securities to support the insurance coverage it provides 
we have transferred certain domestic real estate and intellectual property ie trademarks into separate wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries 
these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries lease the real estate property to sears and license the use of the trademarks to sears and kmart 
further  the bankruptcy remote subsidiaries have issued asset backed notes that are collateralized by the aforementioned real estate rental streams and intellectual property licensing fee streams 
cash flows received from rental streams and licensing fee streams paid by sears  kmart and  potentially in the future  other affiliates or third parties  will be used for the payment of fees  interest and principal on the asset backed notes issued 
since the inception of these subsidiaries  the debt securities have been entirely held by our wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries in support of our insurance activities 
at january  and january   the net book value of the securitized intellectual property assets was approximately billion 
the net book value of the securitized real estate assets was approximately billion at january  and billion at january  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  is aggregated in the following tables

we currently have license agreements for which we pay royalties  including those to use american greetings and joe boxer 
royalty license fees represent the minimum holdings is obligated to pay  regardless of sales  as guaranteed royalties under these license agreements 
at january   our uncertain tax position liability and gross interest payable were million and million  respectively 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of liabilities and interest payments arising from uncertain tax positions in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
other commercial commitments we issue various types of guarantees in the normal course of business 
we had the following guarantees outstanding at january  millions bank issued srac issued other total standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit secondary lease obligations and performance guarantee the secondary lease obligations relate to certain store leases of previously divested sears businesses 
we remain secondarily liable if the primary obligor defaults 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates 
these estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the selection of these estimates 
the following is a summary of our most critical policies and estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined primarily using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is commonly used in the retail industry 
to determine inventory cost under rim  inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics  which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the year purchasing activity for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation 
rim inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
among others  two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and shrinkage 
amounts are charged to cost of sales  buying and occupancy at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  fashion trends and weather conditions 
in addition  inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre determined historical markdown cadences 
when a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the timing of the decision  particularly surrounding the balance sheet date  can have a significant effect on the results of operations 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the year 
physical inventories are taken annually for all stores and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is used as the basis for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  asbestos and environmental  automobile  warranty  product and general liability claims 
general liability costs relate primarily to litigation that arises from store operations 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed and carried at their expected ultimate settlement value and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimated claim amounts are discounted using a rate with a duration that approximates the duration of our self insurance reserve portfolio 
our liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheets represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred at the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors based on company specific data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
these projections are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
defined benefit retirement plans the fundamental components of accounting for defined benefit retirement plans consist of the compensation cost of the benefits earned  the interest cost from deferring payment of those benefits into the future and the results of investing any assets set aside to fund the obligation 
such retirement benefits were earned by associates ratably over their service careers 
therefore  the amounts reported in the income statement for these retirement plans have historically followed the same pattern 
accordingly  changes in the obligations or the value of assets to fund them have been recognized systematically and gradually over the associate s estimated period of service 
the largest drivers of losses in recent years have been the discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation and the actual return on pension assets 
we recognize the changes by amortizing experience gains losses in excess of the corridor into expense over the associate service period and by recognizing the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five year period 
holdings actuarial valuations utilize key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
income taxes we account for income taxes according to accounting standards for such taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  the company may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions  we record unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
further  we record the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  if any 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  tax planning and the company s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
management s estimates at the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment  giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
for further information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments at january  and january   we had goodwill and intangible asset balances of billion and billion  respectively 
holdings evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment under accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets 
the majority of our goodwill and intangible assets relate to kmart s acquisition of sears  roebuck and co 
in march we allocated goodwill  which is defined as the total purchase price less the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired  to reporting units at the acquisition date 
as required by accounting standards  we perform annual goodwill and intangible impairment tests in the fourth quarter and update the tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment assessments our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using both a market participant approach  as well as a discounted cash flow model  commonly referred to as the income approach 
the market participant approach determines the value of a reporting unit by deriving market multiples for reporting units based on assumptions potential market participants would use in establishing a bid price for the unit 
this approach therefore assumes strategic initiatives will result in improvements in operational performance in the event of purchase  and includes the application of a discount rate based on market participant assumptions with respect to capital structure and access to capital markets 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
our final estimate of fair value of reporting units is developed by equally weighting the fair values determined through both the market participant and income approaches 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in or see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and related impairment charges recorded during the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units  the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  or the estimated fair value of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion that no indication of goodwill impairment existed at the test date would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units  or a basis point decrease in the estimated sales growth rate or terminal period growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit 
based on our sensitivity analysis  we do not believe that the recorded goodwill balance is at risk of impairment at any reporting unit at the end of the year because the fair value is substantially in excess of the carrying value and not at risk of failing step one 
however  goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods in one or more of the reporting units to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment  retail industry or in the equity markets  which includes the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more reporting units 
intangible asset impairment assessments we review definite and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider both the market approach and income approach when testing intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis 
we determined that the income approach  specifically the relief from royalty method  was most appropriate for analyzing our indefinite lived assets 
this method is based on the assumption that  in lieu of ownership  a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class 
the relief from royalty method involves two steps i estimation of reasonable royalty rates for the assets and ii the application of these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine a value 
we multiplied the selected royalty rate by the forecasted net sales stream to calculate the cost savings relief from royalty payment associated with the assets 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value by the selected discount rate and compared to the carrying value of the assets 
we did not record any intangible asset impairment charges in or the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in our intangible asset impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of assets and the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of an asset  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion that no indication of intangible asset impairment existed at the test date would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our assets to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units  a basis point decrease in the terminal period growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit  or a basis point decrease in the royalty rate applied to the forecasted net sales stream of our assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
these market risks arise from our derivative financial instruments and debt obligations 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
all debt securities and interest rate derivative instruments are considered non trading 
at january   of our debt portfolio was variable rate 
based on the size of this variable rate debt portfolio at january   which totaled approximately million  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would have affected annual pretax funding costs by million 
these estimates do not take into account the effect on income resulting from invested cash or the returns on assets being funded 
these estimates also assume that the variable rate funding portfolio remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
foreign currency risk at january   we had a series of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding  totaling million canadian notional value and with a weighted average remaining life of years  designed to hedge our net investment in sears canada against adverse changes in exchange rates 
the aggregate fair value of the forward contracts at january  was million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar at january   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a loss in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts of approximately million at january  certain of our currency forward contracts require collateral be posted in the event our liability under such contracts reaches a predetermined threshold 
cash collateral posted under these contracts is recorded as part of our accounts receivable balance 
we had million of cash collateral posted under these contracts at january  sears canada mitigates the risk of currency fluctuations on offshore merchandise purchases denominated in us currency by purchasing us dollar denominated collar contracts for a portion of its expected requirements 
at january   these contracts had a notional value of approximately million and a weighted average remaining life of years 
the aggregate fair value of the collar contracts at january  was negative million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar at january   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a fair value for these contracts of approximately negative million at january   a decrease of million 
counterparties we actively manage the risk of nonpayment by our derivative counterparties by limiting our exposure to individual counterparties based on credit ratings  value at risk and maturities 
the counterparties to these instruments are major financial institutions with credit ratings of single a or better 
in certain cases  counterparty risk is also managed through the use of collateral in the form of cash or us government securities
