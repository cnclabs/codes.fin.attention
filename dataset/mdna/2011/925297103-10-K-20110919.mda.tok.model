item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial trends in the fiscal year we delivered solid financial results that reflected improvement in net income and gross revenue compared to the fiscal year 
our improved performance was driven by both an aggressive growth strategy and cost reduction efforts targeted at our fixed and controllable expenses 
for instance  in fiscal we continued to shift our emphasis to afghanistan in an attempt to maintain and expand our business there in order to replace revenues from the reconstruction efforts in iraq that were significantly reduced during fiscal year we also continued to invest heavily in business development activities and our internal technology infrastructure  and we recognized increased revenue from our acquisitions completed during the third quarter of fiscal year we remained focused on identifying additional complementary businesses to integrate into our existing business segments to compliment organic growth and strengthen the company s overall depth and backlog 
we foresee continued pressure and weakness in the united states and world economies with slow and gradual economic recovery 
during periods of economic uncertainty and volatility  our federal government business has historically been the most stable and predictable 
however  the growing federal deficit and uncertainty in our federal government and dod future budgets may impact our future revenue and in that regard we have experienced some delays in project funding and contract awards 
our business continues to be operated through the following four business segments program management  compliance and environmental programs  professional services  and national security 
program management remains our largest business 
these segments were segregated based on the nature of the work  business processes  customer base and the business environment in which each of the segments operates 
there are a number of risk factors or uncertainties that could significantly impact our future financial performance  including the following general economic or political conditions  threatened or pending litigation  the timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives  employee hiring  utilization  and turnover rates  the seasonality of spending in the federal government and for commercial clients  delays in project contracted engagements  unanticipated contract changes impacting profitability  reductions in prices by our competitors  the ability to obtain follow on work  failure to properly manage projects resulting in additional costs  the cost of compliance for our laboratories  the results of a negative government audit potentially impacting our costs  reputation and ability to work with the federal government  loss of key personnel  the ability to compete in a highly competitive environment  federal funding delays due to wars in iraq and afghanistan  and integration of acquisitions and their ability to perform as expected

table of contents in march  we modified our line of credit facility with united bank the bank to increase its aggregate borrowing capacity from million to million in anticipation of higher working capital requirements resulting from the acquisitions of pps and advent 
the modification also reduced the minimum tangible net worth requirement and revised certain letter of credit and fee provisions of the credit facility 
the line of credit is subject to certain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios 
as modified  these covenants require a minimum tangible net worth of million  a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  and a minimum current ratio of at least to interest accrues on borrowings under the line of credit at the prime rate of interest less with a floor interest rate of 
borrowing rates at fiscal years   and were approximately   and  respectively 
failure to meet the covenant requirements gives the bank the right to demand outstanding amounts due under the line of credit  which may impact our ability to finance our working capital requirements

availability under the line of credit at july  was approximately million 
obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by the company and each domestic subsidiary individually and are secured by accounts receivable  equipment and intangibles  plus all insurance policies on property constituting collateral of the company and its domestic subsidiaries

we financed a portion of the acquisitions of pps and advent through seller notes of approximately million 
at july   the principal balances of the notes payable were approximately  and  for pps and advent  respectively 
we anticipate the cash flows from the newly acquired entities will cover such obligations in the foreseeable future

expected capital requirements for fiscal year are approximately million  to be used primarily for upgrades to maintain our existing information technology systems  equipment related to our range management projects  and upgrades to our personal protective equipment manufacturing

table of contents critical accounting policies and related estimates that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial position and results of operations which require management judgments and estimates  or involve uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition contracts in process are stated at the lower of actual costs incurred plus accrued profits or incurred costs reduced by progress billings 
on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
we record income from major fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may affect the revenue recognition on a project 
revisions to such estimates are made when they become known 
detailed quarterly project reviews are conducted with project managers to review all project progress accruals and revenue recognition 
there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of our business on projects where we are contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability and collectibility 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
management reviews outstanding receivables on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectibility of such receivables 
all receivables over days old are reviewed as part of this process 
share based compensation share based compensation is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award 
the majority of the company s equity awards granted in fiscal years and have been restricted stock unit awards 
share based compensation cost for restricted stock unit awards is based on the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation cost for stock options is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options  as calculated using the black scholes pricing model 
net deferred tax asset we have approximately million in net deferred tax assets as of july  these deferred tax assets are comprised of accrued expenses  reserves  employee benefits and are offset against deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization 
we expect these net deferred tax assets to be fully utilized except for net operating loss carryforwards from our philippine branch in the amount of  for which  consistent with prior years  a valuation allowance has continued to be maintained 
long lived assets we are required to review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
we review the cash flows of the operating units to ensure the carrying values do not exceed the cash flows that they support 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions 
we believe our long lived assets as of july  are fully realizable 

table of contents goodwill the carrying value of our goodwill was approximately million as of july  and june  this goodwill was generated from the acquisitions of pps and advent in fiscal year and the acquisition of versar global solutions  inc in fiscal year in performing the goodwill impairment analysis  management utilized a market based valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of our four business segments  which represent our five reporting units our national security business segment has two reporting units 
management engaged outside professionals and valuation experts to assist in performing this analysis and would test more often if events and circumstances warranted it 
we have elected to perform the annual goodwill impairment assessment on the last day of each fiscal year 
as part of the impairment assessment an analysis was performed on public companies and company transactions to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the net assets as of july  accordingly the goodwill impairment test for fiscal year concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired 
should the financial performance of the reporting units not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether a write down of goodwill value would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact our cash flow or financial debt covenants 
other intangible assets we had intangible assets with a net carrying amount of approximately million and million as of july  and june   respectively 
the intangible assets include technology based assets  customer related assets  and marketing related assets 
the intangible assets are amortized over a year or year life 
we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
we review the cash flows of the reporting units to ensure the carrying values do not exceed the cash flows that they support 
any impairments of the asset are treated as permanent reductions 
we believe that our intangible assets were not impaired during fiscal years and asset retirement obligation during we recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with the estimated clean up costs for its chemical laboratory in the national security business segment 
we estimated the costs to clean up the laboratory and return it to its original state at a present value of approximately  if we determine that the estimated cleanup cost is larger than expected such adjustments will be reflected when they become known 
at july   we have accrued approximately  as a current liability to clean up the chemical laboratory 
new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting guidance during fiscal year in july  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that enhances disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the guidance is intended to provide additional information to assist financial statement users in assessing an entity s credit risk exposures and evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses 
on december   we began to disclose the required information about the credit quality of our receivables 
on january   we began to disclose the required information about the activity of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  as its requirements are disclosure related in nature 
recently issued accounting guidance in june  the fasb issued authoriative guidance which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  comprehensive income must be reported in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance will be effective for us beginning with our fiscal year 
we do not expect the guidance to impact our financial statements  as it only requires a change in the format of presentation 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on how to measure fair value  expanding fair value disclosure requirements  and offering guidance on what disclosures to make about fair value measurements 
the guidance is intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
the guidance does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  our fiscal year  and should be applied prospectively 
early adoption is not permitted for publically traded entities 
upon adoption  we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the new accounting guidance modifies step of the impairment test whereby an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors that may exist that would indicate it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
this may result in companies reporting goodwill impairments sooner as compared to under the current accounting guidance 
this new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  our fiscal year 
early adoption of this guidance is not permitted 
we will evaluate the impact of this guidance on our financial condition  and results of operation upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued interpretive guidance on the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the interpretive guidance specifies that an entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
also  supplemental pro forma disclosures should be expanded to include a description of the nature and amount of material  non recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this new accounting guidance is effective for a business combination with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  which is july  for us 
early adoption of this guidance is permitted 
we will implement this guidance for any future business combinations 
impact of inflation we protect ourselves from the effects of inflation 
the majority of contracts we perform are for a period of a year or less and are firm fixed price contracts 
multi year contracts provide for projected increases in labor and other costs 
business segments we currently have four business segments program management  compliance and environmental programs  professional services  and national security 
additional details regarding these segments are contained in note b business segments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and other relevant market risk is not material
