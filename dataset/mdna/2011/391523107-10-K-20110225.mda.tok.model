industry trends 
we operate in the family entertainment resort segment of the travel and leisure industry 
the concept of a family entertainment resort with an indoor waterpark was first introduced to the united states in wisconsin dells  wisconsin  and has evolved since in an effort to boost occupancy and daily rates  as well as capture off season demand  hotel operators in the wisconsin dells market began expanding indoor pools and adding waterslides and other water based attractions to existing hotels and resorts 
the success of these efforts prompted several local operators to build new  larger destination resorts based primarily on the concept 
we believe that these resorts have proven popular because of several factors  including the ability to provide a year round vacation destination without weather related risks  the wide appeal of water based recreation and the favorable trends in leisure travel discussed below 
no operator or developer other than great wolf resorts has established a national portfolio of destination family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks 

table of contents while no standard industry definition for a family entertainment resort featuring an indoor waterpark has developed  we generally consider resorts with at least rooms featuring indoor waterparks larger than  square feet  as well as a variety of water slides and other water based attractions  to be competitive with our resorts 
a hotel leisure advisors  llc h la survey as of june indicates that there are open indoor waterpark resort properties in the united states and canada 
of the total  are considered indoor waterpark destination resorts offering more than  square feet of indoor waterpark space 
of these properties  are our properties 
we believe recent vacation trends favor drive to family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks  as the number of families choosing to take shorter  more frequent vacations that they can drive to have increased in recent years 
we believe these trends will continue 
we believe indoor waterpark resorts are generally less affected by changes in economic cycles  as drive to destinations are generally less expensive and more convenient than destinations that require air travel 
outlook 
we believe that no other operator or developer other than us has established a national portfolio of destination family entertainment resorts that feature indoor waterparks 
our resorts do  however  compete directly with other family entertainment resorts in several of our markets 
we intend to continue to expand our portfolio of resorts throughout the united states and to selectively seek licensing and management opportunities domestically and internationally 
the resorts we plan to develop  license and or operate in the future require significant industry knowledge and substantial capital resources 
our external growth strategy going forward is to seek joint venture  licensing and management opportunities 
we expect each of these joint venture arrangements would involve us having a minority or no ownership interest in the new resort 
we believe there are opportunities to capitalize on our existing brand and operational platforms with lower capital requirements from us than if we were the sole or majority owner of the new resort 
our primary business objective is to increase long term stockholder value 
we believe we can increase stockholder value by executing our internal and external growth strategies 
our primary growth strategies are leveraging our competitive advantages and increasing domestic geographic diversification through a license based business model and joint venture investments in target markets  expanding our brand footprint internationally  selective sales dispositions of ownership interests recycling of capital  expanding and enhancing existing resorts  continuing to innovate  maximizing total resort revenues  minimizing total resort costs  building upon our existing brand awareness and loyalty  and expanding operations of our majority owned subsidiary  creative kingdoms 
in attempting to execute our internal and external growth strategies  we are subject to a variety of business challenges and risks 
these risks include those described under risk factors risks related to our business activities and risk factors risks related to regulation 
we seek to meet these challenges by providing sufficient management oversight to site selection  development and resort operations  concentrating on growing and strengthening awareness of our brand and demand for our resorts  and maintaining our focus on safety 
our business model is highly dependent on consumer spending  because the majority of our revenues are earned from leisure guests and a vacation experience at one of our resorts is a discretionary expenditure for a family 
over the past several years  the slowdown in the us economy and accompanying economic recession 
table of contents has led to a decrease in credit for consumers and a related decrease in consumer discretionary spending 
this trend continued through as consumers experienced several negative economic impacts  including continued turbulence in the banking and lending sectors  which has led to a general lessening of the availability of credit to consumers  a high national unemployment rate  a continuing decline in the national average of home prices and an increase in the national home foreclosure rate  and high volatility in the stock market that led to substantial declines in stock values and aggregate household savings from to these and other factors impact the amount of discretionary income for consumers and consumer sentiment toward discretionary purchases 
as a result  these types of items could negatively impact consumer spending in future periods 
while we believe the convenience  quality and overall affordability of a stay at one of our resorts continues to be an attractive alternative to other potential family vacations  a sustained decrease in overall consumer discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our overall results 
we develop resorts with expectations of achieving certain financial returns on a resort s operation 
the economic slowdown of the past several years has materially and adversely affected our ability to achieve the operating results for our resorts that we had expected to achieve when those resorts were first planned and developed 
also we believe that our traverse city and sandusky resorts have been and will continue to be affected by especially adverse general economic circumstances in the michigan northern ohio region such as bankruptcies of several major companies and or large announced layoffs by major employers and increased competition that has occurred in these markets over the past few years 
the michigan northern ohio region includes cities that have historically been the traverse city and sandusky resorts largest source of customers 
we believe the adverse general economic circumstances in the region have negatively impacted overall discretionary consumer spending in that region over the past few years and may continue to do so going forward 
although we have taken steps to reduce our operating costs at these resorts  we believe the general regional economic downturn has and may continue to have an impact on the operating performance of our traverse city and sandusky resorts 
in september  the loan servicer for our loan that is secured by our traverse city and kansas city resorts implemented a lock box cash management arrangement 
at our request  in october the loan was transferred to its special servicer 
as described under critical accounting policies and estimates investments in property and equipment  we recorded a  impairment charge in relating to our traverse city and kansas city resorts 
our wisconsin dells property has been significantly impacted by the abundance of competing indoor waterpark resorts in that market 
the wisconsin dells market has approximately indoor waterpark resorts that compete with us 
we believe this large number of competing properties in a relatively small tourist destination location has and will likely continue to have an adverse impact on the operating performance of our wisconsin dells resort 
we have experienced much lower than expected occupancy and lower than expected average daily room rates at our sheboygan  wisconsin property since its opening in we believe this operating weakness has been primarily attributable to the fact that the overall development of sheboygan as a tourist destination continues to lag materially behind our initial expectations 
we believe this has materially impacted and will likely continue to impact the consumer demand for our indoor waterpark resort in that market and the operations of the resort 
as described under critical accounting policies and estimates investments in property and equipment  we recorded a  impairment charge in relating to our sheboygan resort 
in may  we listed the resort for sale 

table of contents our external growth strategies are based primarily on developing additional indoor waterpark resorts  converting existing indoor waterpark resorts to our brands in conjunction with joint venture partners  or by licensing our intellectual property and proprietary management systems to others 
developing resorts of the size and scope of our family entertainment resorts generally requires obtaining financing for a significant portion of a project s expected construction costs 
the general tightening in us lending markets has dramatically decreased the overall availability of construction financing 
although the ultimate effect on our external growth strategy of the current credit environment is difficult to predict with certainty  we believe that the availability of construction financing to us and other investors and or developers may be more restrictive in the future and that terms of construction financing may be less favorable than was the case through although we believe that we and other investors and or developers may be able to obtain construction financing sufficient to execute development strategies  we expect that the more difficult credit market environment is likely to continue at least through revenue and key performance indicators 
we seek to generate positive cash flows and maximize our return on invested capital from each of our owned resorts 
our rooms revenue represents sales to guests of room nights at our resorts and is the largest contributor to our cash flows and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda 
rooms revenue accounted for approximately of our total consolidated resort revenue for the year ended december  we employ sales and marketing efforts to increase overall demand for rooms at our resorts 
we seek to optimize the relationship between room rates and occupancies through the use of yield management techniques that attempt to project demand in order to selectively increase room rates during peak demand 
these techniques are designed to assist us in managing our higher occupancy nights to achieve maximum rooms revenue and include such practices as monitoring our historical trends for occupancy and estimating our high occupancy nights  offering the highest discounts to previous guests in off peak periods to build customer loyalty and enhance our ability to charge higher rates in peak periods  structuring rates to allow us to offer our previous guests the best rate while simultaneously working with a promotional partner or offering internet specials  monitoring sales of room types daily to evaluate the effectiveness of offered discounts  and offering specials on standard suites and yielding better rates on larger suites when standard suites sell out 
in addition  we seek to maximize the amount of time and money spent on site by our guests by providing a variety of revenue generating amenities 
we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these indicators include the following occupancy  average daily room rate  or adr  revenue per available room  or revpar  total revenue per occupied room  or total revpor  total revenue per available room  or total revpar  non rooms revenue per occupied room  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 

table of contents occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hospitality industry to evaluate hotel operations and are defined as follows occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms by total available rooms 
adr is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue by total occupied rooms 
revpar is the product of occupancy and adr 
total revpor  total revpar and non rooms revenue per occupied room are defined as follows total revpor is calculated by dividing total revenue by total occupied rooms 
total revpar is calculated by dividing total revenue by total available rooms 
non rooms revenue per occupied room is calculated by taking the difference between total revpor and adr 
occupancy allows us to measure the general overall demand for rooms at our resorts and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategies 
adr allows us to measure the effectiveness of our yield management strategies 
while adr and revpar only include rooms revenue  total revpor and total revpar include both rooms revenue and other revenue derived from food and beverage and other amenities at our resorts 
we consider total revpor and total revpar to be key performance indicators for our business because we derive a significant portion of our revenue from food and beverage and other amenities 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total consolidated resort revenues consisted of non rooms revenue 
we use revpar and total revpar to evaluate the blended effect that changes in occupancy  adr and total revpor have on our results 
we focus on increasing adr and total revpor because we believe those increases can have the greatest positive impact on our results 
in addition  we seek to maximize occupancy  as increases in occupancy generally lead to greater total revenues at our resorts  and we believe maintaining certain occupancy levels is key to covering our fixed costs 
increases in total revenues as a result of higher occupancy are  however  typically accompanied by additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
in contrast  increases in total revenues from higher adr and total revpor are typically accompanied by lower incremental costs and result generally  in a greater increase in operating cash flow 
we also use ebitda as a measure of our operational performance of each of our resorts 
ebitda is a supplemental financial measure and is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
see non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of our use of ebitda and a reconciliation to net loss attributable to great wolf resorts  inc critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operating is based on our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unconsolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
acquisition accounting we follow acquisition accounting for all acquisitions that meet the business combination definition 
acquisition accounting requires us to measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest at the acquisition date fair value 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process ot accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 

table of contents as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in property and equipment 
we record investments in property and equipment at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years fixtures and equipment  including waterpark equipment years we are required to make subjective assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record annually with respect to our investments in property and equipment 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net loss because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in property and equipment we would depreciate and amortize such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation and amortization expense and a larger net loss on an annual basis 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives we have assigned to our depreciable assets to determine whether those useful lives are reasonable and appropriate 
when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate the carrying values of a long lived asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the expected future operations of the asset 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  operating trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded  of impairment charges related to our traverse city and kansas city resorts 
we determined the carrying values of these resorts were impaired in light of the reduced estimated hold periods for the resorts 
because of the reduced estimated hold periods  we performed recoverability tests of these resorts to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required 
based on this analysis of undiscounted cash flows  we determined the carrying value of these resorts were not recoverable 
as a result  we recorded an  impairment charge to decrease the resorts carrying value to their estimated fair value net of estimated disposal costs as of december  we estimated the properties fair values by using available market information for similar assets  as well as considering estimated future cash flows  terminal values based on the projected cash flows and capitalization rates in the range of what is reported in industry publications for operationally similar assets and other available market information 
the cash flows considered in estimating the fair values were discounted using market based discounts generally used for operationally and geographically similar assets 
although we believe our estimated fair value for the resorts are reasonable  the actual fair value we ultimately realize from these resorts could differ materially from these estimates 
because of triggering events that occurred in related to our sheboygan resort  including changes in the expectation of how long we will hold this property  current period and historical operating losses and the deterioration in the current market conditions  we performed a recoverability test of this resort to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required 
based on this analysis of undiscounted cash flows  we determined the carrying value of this resort was not recoverable 
as a result  we recorded a  impairment charge to decrease the resort s carrying value to its estimated fair value net of estimated disposal costs in to determine the estimated fair value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge  we used a combination of historical and projected cash flows and other available market information  such as 
table of contents recent sales prices for similar assets 
although we believe our estimated fair value for the resort is reasonable  the actual fair value we ultimately realize from this resort could differ materially from this estimate 
intangible assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflects  of intangible assets mainly related to our great wolf lodge brand name 
this brand name intangible asset has an indefinite life 
we are required to assess indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these intangibles 
we had no impairment losses related to intangible assets in any of the periods presented 
investments in affiliates when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that the carrying value of our investments in affiliates may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
to test investment in affiliates for impairment  we compare the fair value of the investment in affiliates with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the investment in affiliates is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that continued adverse current and expected market conditions for our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts indicated that our minority investment in the joint venture that owned these resorts may be impaired 
in early  we concluded that the fair value of our investment in this joint venture  was less than its carrying value 
as a result  in we recorded an  impairment loss related to our interest in the joint venture that owned the wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts  as the implied fair value of the investment  was less than its carrying value 
in august  we sold our joint venture interest to cnl for we do not believe current circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our minority investment in the joint venture that owns our grand mound resort may be impaired 
the carrying value of our interest in our joint venture that owns the great wolf lodge in grand mound was  as of december  accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income that could result from a sale of one or more of our resorts where there s a sales price in excess of tax basis  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  we would establish a valuation allowance which would increase the provision for income taxes 
conversely  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 

table of contents as of december  and  we recorded valuation allowances of  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance we recorded is based on our estimates of taxable income solely from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and the period over which deferred tax assets reverse 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in a future period  we may need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated statement of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance which changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance 
the guidance requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
a reporting entity will be required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entity s financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted this guidance on january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
this guidance eliminates the residual method under the current guidance and replaces it with the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price shall be used 
if neither exists for a deliverable  the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
after adoption  this guidance will also require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
the guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   although early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurement and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
the updated guidance also requires that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
this updated guidance became effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance on january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance on disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the guidance requires new disclosures that will require companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to the financial statements including  but not limited to  significant purchases and sales of financing receivables  aging information and credit quality indicators 
this guidance will be effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which does not prescribe a specific method of calculating the carrying calculating the carrying value of a reporting unit in the performance of step of the goodwill impairment test and requires entities with a zero or negative carrying value to assess  considering certain qualitative factors  whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
if an entity 
table of contents concludes that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  the entity must perform step of the goodwill impairment test 
this guidance will be effective for impairment tests performed during fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance to address difference in the ways entities have interpreted disclosures about pro forma revenue and earnings in a business combination 
this guidance states that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
this guidance will be effective prospectively for business combinations whose acquisition date is at or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures we use ebitda as a measure of our operating performance 
ebitda is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is commonly defined as net income loss attributable to great wolf resorts  inc  plus a interest expense  net of interest income  b income tax expense or benefit and c depreciation and amortization 
ebitda as calculated by us is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
in addition  ebitda a does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  b is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash flow needs  and c should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or our other financial information as determined under gaap 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because a significant portion of our assets consists of property and equipment that are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in accordance with gaap 
because depreciation and amortization are non cash items  we believe that presentation of ebitda is a useful measure of our operating performance  it is widely used in the hospitality and entertainment industries to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  and we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business  and as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions 
some of ebitda s limitations are it does not reflect every cash expenditure  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitment  it does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  
table of contents although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future  and our ebitda based measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements or improvements  it is not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows  it does not reflect limitations on our costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us  and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as competitive measures 
because of these limitations  our ebitda based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 
we compensate for these limitations by using our ebitda based measures along with other comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of operating performance 
such gaap measurements include operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and cash flow data 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including capital expenditures  interest payments  debt principal repayments  taxes and other non recurring charges  which are not reflected in our ebitda based measures 
ebitda is not intended as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our operating performance  as an alternative to any other measure of performance in conformity with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity 
you should therefore not place undue reliance on our ebitda based measures or ratios calculated using these measures 
our gaap based measures can be found in our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this report

total depreciation and amortization increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the expansion of our grapevine resort as well as the opening of our concord resort 
also  loan fees incurred during the year ended december  were higher than in the year ended december  due to fees incurred in connection with the extensions of our mason and grapevine mortgage loans 
for the year ended december   we recorded an aggregate  impairment loss related to our interest in the joint venture that owned wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had total indebtedness of  summarized as follows long term debt traverse city kansas city mortgage loan pocono mountains mortgage loan concord mortgage loan first mortgage notes net of discount of  junior subordinated debentures other debt city of sheboygan bonds city of sheboygan loan other traverse city kansas city mortgage loan this non recourse loan is secured by our traverse city and kansas city resorts 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of  is subject to a year principal amortization schedule  and matures in january the loan has customary financial and operating debt compliance covenants 
the loan also has customary restrictions on our ability to prepay the loan prior to maturity 
we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  while recourse under the loan is limited to the property owner s interest in the mortgaged property  we have provided limited guarantees with respect to certain customary non recourse provisions and environmental indemnities relating to the loan 
the loan also contains limitations on our ability  without lender s consent  to i make payments to our affiliates if a default exists  ii enter into transactions with our affiliates  iii make loans or advances  or iv assume  guarantee or become liable in connection with any other obligations 
the loan requires us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio dscr of  calculated on a quarterly basis 
this ratio is defined as the two collateral properties combined trailing twelve month net operating income divided by the greater of i the loan s twelve month debt service requirements and ii of the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness under the loan 
failure to meet the minimum dscr is not an event of default and does not accelerate the due date of the loan 
not meeting the minimum dscr  however  subjects the two properties to a lock box cash management arrangement  at the discretion of the loan s servicer 
the loan also contains a similar lock box requirement if we open any great wolf lodge or blue harbor resort within miles of either resort  and the two collateral properties combined trailing twelve month net operating income is not at least equal to times of the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness under the loan 
for the year ended december   the dscr for this loan was 
in september the loan s master servicer implemented the lock box cash management arrangement 
that lock box cash management arrangement currently requires substantially all cash receipts for the two resorts to be moved each day to a lender controlled bank account  which the loan servicer then uses monthly to fund debt service and operating expenses for the two resorts  with excess cash flow being deposited in a reserve account and held as additional collateral for the loan 
we believe that this arrangement currently constitutes a traditional lock box arrangement as discussed in authoritative accounting guidance 
based on that guidance  since the loan s master servicer has now established the traditional lock box arrangement currently permitted under the loan  we have classified the entire outstanding principal balance of the loan as a current liability at december   since the lock box arrangement requires us to use the properties working capital to service the loan  and we do not presently have the ability to refinance this loan to a new  long term loan 
at our request  in october the loan was transferred to its special servicer 
the dscr for this loan has been below on a trailing twelve month basis since the second quarter of we have informed the special servicer that  given the current and expected performance of the two properties securing this loan  we 
table of contents may elect to cease the subsidization of debt service on this non recourse loan 
if we were to elect to cease the subsidization of debt service  that would likely result in a default under the loan agreement 
we believe the combined market value of the two properties securing this loan is now significantly less than the principal amount of the loan 
we are working with the loan s special servicer to discuss a potential modification of this loan  but we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve such a result 
absent a satisfactory modification of this loan  we expect to choose among several possible courses of action  including electing to continue the subsidization of debt service on this loan  attempting to refinance the existing loan which we believe would result in materially lower proceeds than the current loan balance  thus requiring a significant paydown on the existing loan balance  or surrendering the two properties to the lender or a lender appointed receiver 
the properties had a combined net book value of  as of december   and the amount of debt outstanding under the mortgage was  as of that date 
mason mortgage loan this loan was secured by our mason resort 
in april  we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of new first mortgage notes to repay this loan in its entirety 
pocono mountains mortgage loan this loan is secured by our pocono mountains resort 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of and matures in december the loan is currently subject to a year principal amortization schedule 
the loan has customary covenants associated with an individual mortgaged property 
the loan also has customary restrictions on our ability to prepay the loan prior to maturity 
we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  the loan requires us to maintain a minimum dscr of  calculated on a quarterly basis 
subject to certain exceptions  the dscr is increased to if we open up a waterpark resort within miles of the property or incur mezzanine debt secured by the resort 
this ratio is defined as the property s combined trailing twelve month net operating income divided by the greater of i the loan s twelve month debt service requirements and ii of the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness under the loan 
failure to meet the minimum dscr is not an event of default and does not accelerate the due date of the loan 
not meeting the minimum dscr  however  subjects the property to a lock box cash management arrangement  at the discretion of the loan s servicer 
we believe that lock box arrangement would require substantially all cash receipts for the resort to be moved each day to a lender controlled bank account  which the loan servicer would then use to fund debt service and operating expenses for the resort  with excess cash flow being deposited in a reserve account and held as additional collateral for the loan 
while recourse under the loan is limited to the property owner s interest in the mortgage property  we have provided limited guarantees with respect to certain customary non recourse provisions and environmental indemnities relating to the loan

the loan bears interest at a floating annual rate of libor plus a spread of basis points  with a minimum rate of per annum effective rate of as of december  
this loan matures in april and requires interest only payments until the one year anniversary of the conversion date of the property and then requires monthly principal payments based on a year amortization schedule 
however  if the resort owner s net income available to pay debt service on this loan for four consecutive quarters is less than  or if maximum principal amount of the loan exceeds of the fair market value of the property  then we are required to post cash collateral or partially repay the loan in an amount sufficient to remedy such deficiency

we are amortizing the discount over the life of the notes using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method

city of sheboygan loan the city of sheboygan loan amount represents a loan made by the city in in conjunction with the construction of the blue harbor resort in sheboygan  wisconsin 
the loan is noninterest bearing and matures in our obligation to repay the loan will be satisfied by certain minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments to be made by the blue harbor resort through future maturities future principal requirements on long term debt as of december  are as follows thereafter total as discussed above  the traverse city kansas city mortgage loan is classified as a current liability as of december   due to the implementation of a traditional lock box arrangement 
the future maturities table above  however  reflects future cash principal repayments currently required under the provisions of that loan in the amounts of  in   in   in   in and  in short term liquidity requirements our short term liquidity requirements generally consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses for the next months  including recurring maintenance  repairs and other operating expenses necessary to properly maintain and operate our resorts  recurring capital expenditures we make at our resorts  debt maturities within the next year  property taxes and insurance expenses  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  general and administrative expenses  and income taxes 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of operating cash flows and cash on hand 
we believe that cash provided by our operations  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service for the next months 

table of contents long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements generally consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the following items for periods beyond the next months scheduled debt maturities  costs associated with the development of new resorts  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our resorts  and capital contributions and loans to unconsolidated joint ventures 
we expect to meet these needs through a combination of existing working capital  cash provided by operations  proceeds from investing activities  including sales of partial or whole ownership interests in certain of our resorts  and proceeds from financing activities  including mortgage financing on properties being developed  additional or replacement borrowings under future credit facilities  contributions from joint venture partners  and the issuance of equity instruments  including common stock  or additional or replacement debt  including debt securities  as market conditions permit 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
in april  as discussed above  we issued  aggregate principal amount of first mortgage notes due and used the net proceeds from that offering to repay three existing mortgage loans that were scheduled to mature in we cannot be certain  however  that we will have access to financing sufficient to meet our long term liquidity requirements on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
our largest long term expenditures other than debt maturities are expected to be for capital expenditures for our existing resorts  and capital contributions or loans to joint ventures owning resorts under construction or development 
such expenditures were  for the year ended december  we expect to have approximately  of such expenditures for as discussed above  we expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations and cash on hand 
we currently project that the combination of our cash on hand plus cash provided by operations in will be sufficient to meet the short term liquidity requirements  as described above 
based on our current projections  however  we do not believe that we will have sufficient excess amounts of cash available in either to begin development of any new resorts or to make material cash capital contributions to new joint ventures that would develop or acquire resorts that we would license and or manage 
also  due to the current state of the capital markets  which are marked by the general unavailability of debt financing for large commercial real estate construction projects  we do not expect to have significant expenditures for development of new resorts until we have all equity and debt capital amounts fully committed  including our projected ability to fund our required equity contribution to a project 
furthermore  the indenture which governs our first mortgage notes imposes significant restrictions on our ability to invest in the development of new resorts or joint venture that may acquire or develop resorts 
we believe these factors will result in our not making any significant cash outlays in for development of new resorts or capital contributions to new joint ventures that develop or acquire resorts 
off balance sheet arrangements in august we sold our joint venture interest in the joint venture that owns two resorts  great wolf lodge wisconsin dells  wisconsin and great wolf lodge sandusky  ohio to cnl income properties  inc we currently manage both properties and license the great wolf lodge brand to the joint venture 

table of contents we have one unconsolidated joint venture arrangement at december  we account for our unconsolidated joint venture using the equity method of accounting 
our joint venture with the confederated tribes of the chehalis reservation owns the great wolf lodge resort and conference center on a acre land parcel in grand mound  washington 
this resort opened in march this joint venture is a limited liability company 
we are a member of that limited liability company with a ownership interest 
at december   the joint venture had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of  as of december   we have made combined loan and equity contributions  net of loan repayments  of  to the joint venture to fund a portion of construction costs of the resort 
based on the nature of the activities conducted in the joint venture  we cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy amounts that we may be required to fund in the long term 
we do not currently believe that any additional future funding of the joint venture will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  as we currently do not expect to make any significant future capital contributions to this joint venture 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment terms less than more than total year years years years debt obligations operating lease obligations reserve on unrecognized tax benefits total amounts include interest for fixed rate debt and principal 
they also include  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by our sheboygan resort 
if we develop future resorts where we are the majority owner  we expect to incur significant additional debt and construction contract obligations 
working capital we had  of available cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  current assets less current liabilities at december   compared to the  of available cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  at december  the primary reasons for the working capital deficit as of december  are an increase in accruals related to the issuance of our first mortgage notes that closed in april  and the classification of our traverse city kansas city mortgage loan principal balance of  as a currently liability due to the lender s implementation of the traditional lock box arrangement for the two properties  as discussed above 
the primary reason for the working capital deficit as of december  was the use of cash for capital expenditures for our properties that were under development

this decrease is also due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to our properties that are in service and in development 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from receiving fewer loan proceeds during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  inflation our resort properties are able to change room and amenity rates on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation can often be passed along to customers 
however  a weak economic environment that decreases overall demand for our products and services could restrict our ability to raise room and amenity rates to offset rising costs

if libor were to increase or decrease by or basis points  there would be no change in interest expense on our variable rate debt based on our debt balances outstanding and current interest rates in effect as of december   as that libor plus the loans basis points would not increase or decrease above the minimum rate floor
