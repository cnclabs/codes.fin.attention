item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  assemble  market and distribute premium quality  technologically innovative golf clubs for all skill levels 
we generate revenues from net sales of golf clubs and accessories that are primarily derived from sales to on and off course golf shops and sporting goods retailers and  to a lesser extent  international distributors and mass merchandisers 
no assurances can be given that demand for our current products  or the introduction of new products  will allow us to achieve historical levels of sales in the future 
our net sales are typically driven by product lifecycles 
several factors affect a product life  including but not limited to  customer acceptance  competition and technology 
as a result  each product family life cycles generally range from six months to three years 
our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations are subject to seasonality resulting from factors such as weather and spending patterns 
due to the seasonality of our business  one quarter financial results are not indicative of the full fiscal year expected financial results 
typically  a majority of our revenue is earned in the first and second quarters of the year  and our revenues generally decline in the third and fourth quarters 
costs of goods sold of our clubs consist primarily of component parts  including the head  shaft and grip 
to a lesser extent  our cost of goods sold includes labor  occupancy and shipping costs in connection with the inspection  testing  assembly and distribution of our products and certain promotional and advertising costs given in the form of additional merchandise as consideration to customers 
key performance indicators our management team has defined and tracks performance against several key sales  operational and balance sheet performance indicators 
key sales performance indicators include  but are not limited to  the following daily sales by product group daily sales by geography sales by customer channel gross margin performance market share by product at retail inventory share by product at retail tracking these sales performance indicators on a regular basis allows us to understand whether we are on target to achieve our internal sales plans 
key operational performance indicators include  but are not limited to  the following product returns dollars and percentage of sales product credits dollars and percentage of sales units shipped per man hour worked orders shipped on time expenses by department inbound and outbound freight cost by mode dollars and dollars per unit inbound freight utilization by mode ocean vs 
air vendor purchase order cycle time tracking these operational performance indicators on a regular basis allows us to understand whether we are on target to achieve our expense targets and efficiently satisfy customer demand 
key balance sheet performance indicators include  but are not limited to  the following days of sales outstanding days of inventory at cost days of payables outstanding tracking these balance sheet performance indicators on a regular basis allows us to understand our working capital performance and forecast cash flow and liquidity 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating results expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development expenses selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses settlement expense total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net other income loss  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  in  we generated an overall increase in year over year revenues of while also delivering approximately in margin  an improvement compared to our results 
additionally  we generated a net profit of million during the year ended december   partially as a result of industry improvement but also as a result of successful products and improved operational performance 
percentage of net sales by product class irons fairway woods drivers wedges and other total total net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period of our sales were primarily driven by the product sales of idea a and a os irons and hybrids  idea tech v irons and hybrids  speedline f drivers and hybrid fairway woods  idea pro black family of irons and hybrids  idea a and a os irons  idea tech a and a os irons  hybrids  and integrated iron sets 
several factors affect a product life  including but not limited to  customer acceptance  competition and technology 
as a result  each product family life cycle generally ranges from six months to three years 
the increase in net sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in overall demand by customers as the economic environment in the united states and abroad has begun to improve 
net sales of irons increased to million  or of total net sales for the year ended december  from million  or of total net sales  for the comparable period of current period iron net sales primarily resulted from sales of the idea a and a os irons  idea tech v irons  idea black irons  and integrated women package sets  while the comparable period of net sales primarily resulted from sales of the idea a and a os irons  idea a and a os irons  idea tech a and a os irons and integrated women package sets 
net sales of fairway woods decreased to million  or of total net sales  for the year ended december   from million  or of total net sales  for the comparable period of net sales for the year ended december  primarily were generated from sales of idea a and a os hybrids  speedline f fairway woods  and idea black super hybrid 
net sales for the year ended december  primarily were generated from sales of idea a and a os hybrids  speedline hybrid fairway woods  idea tech a and a os hybrids  idea a and a os hybrids and idea pro gold hybrids 
net sales of drivers increased to million  or of total net sales  for the year ended december  from million  or of total net sales  for the comparable period of a large portion of the driver net sales for the year ended december  was generated by sales of the speedline f driver  which was launched in the first quarter of  along with the speedline driver  launched in the third quarter of in the comparable period of  net sales were primarily driven by sales the speedline driver  which was launched in the first quarter of  the speedline driver  which we launched in the second quarter of  and idea tech a and a os drivers  which were introduced in the third quarter of we were dependent on three customers  which collectively comprised approximately of net sales  for the year ended december  of these  two customers individually represented greater than but less than of net sales and one customer represented greater than but less than of net sales for this period 
should these customers or our other customers fail to meet their obligations to us  or cease doing business with us altogether  our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted 
net sales of our products outside the united states increased to million  or of total net sales  from million  or of total net sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net sales resulting from countries outside the united states and canada increased to of total net sales for the year ended december  from for the comparable period of cost of goods sold decreased to million  or of total net sales  for the year ended december  from million  or of total net sales  for the comparable period of the decrease as a percentage of total net sales was primarily due to the inventory write down to lower of cost or market and an increase in inventory reserve for obsolescence totaling million taken during the second quarter of coupled with changes in the product mix and increased promotional programs and discounting during selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in commission expense of million resulting from increased revenues and an increase in compensation expense of million resulting from accruals of bonus compensation 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in compensation expense of million resulting from accruals of bonus compensation and an increase in legal expense of million resulting from litigation described under the caption item legal proceedings above 
research and development expenses  primarily consisting of costs associated with the development of new products  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in compensation expense resulting from employee reductions made during our net accounts receivable balances were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase was primarily due to timing and volume of product launches and terms as well as slower payments from the sluggish economy from our customers 
our inventory balances were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in inventory levels was primarily due to the normal timing of inventory delivery during the fourth quarter of compared to the delays we experienced in the fourth quarter of along with an inventory write down to lower of cost or market and an increase in inventory reserve for obsolescence totaling million taken during the second quarter of our accounts payable balances were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily associated with higher purchases of inventory and its timely delivery during the fourth quarter of our accrued liabilities balances were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to our payment for the settlement of the stockholder class action lawsuit  pursuant to which we agreed to contribute million in conjunction with the settlement to cover the layer of exposure on our directors and officers corporate liability insurance that our former insurance carrier has refused to cover 
see item legal proceedings for further details 
this decrease was partially offset by the accrual of bonuses made during and accruals of other expenses related to accounts payable at december  disclosure of contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts  including equipment capital leases and operating leases 
we do not have any long term debt or purchase commitment obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   reported by maturity of obligation 
contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant balance sheet under gaap total liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash reserves  cash flows provided by operations and our credit facilities in effect from time to time 
cash inflows from operations are generally driven by collections of accounts receivables from customers  which generally increase in our second quarter and continue into the third quarter and then begin to decrease during the fourth quarter 
as necessary  we could use our credit facility to supplement our cash inflows from operations as well as effect other investing activities such as potential future acquisitions 
cash outflows are primarily tied to procurement of inventory which typically begins to build during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first and second quarters in order to meet demands during the height of the golf season 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a payment of million made in connection with the settlement of a shareholder suit  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
in november  we signed a revolving credit agreement  which expires november with wachovia bank  na to provide a credit line of up to million in short term debt 
the agreement is collateralized by all of our assets and requires us  among other things  to maintain certain financial performance levels relative to the fixed charge coverage ratio 
this agreement was amended in june so that the ratio is only calculated when we have less than million in availability on the facility  and it was further amended in december to provide that our debt covenant ratio is only calculated if we have less than million in availability on the facility between march and june of each year 
interest on outstanding balances accrues at a rate of libor plus and is payable monthly 
as of december  and march   we had and million  respectively  in outstanding borrowings on our credit facility and we were in compliance with the terms of our agreement 
in  wells fargo bank  na acquired wachovia bank  na 
as a result  wells fargo bank  na  as successor to wachovia bank  na  has become our lender under our existing line of credit and is subject to all of the terms and conditions thereof 
working capital increased at december  to million compared to million at december  approximately of our current assets were comprised of accounts receivable at december  due to industry sensitivity to consumer buying trends  seasonality and available disposable income  we have in the past extended payment terms for specific purchase transactions 
issuance of these terms ie greater than days or specific dating is dependent on our relationship with the customer and the customer payment history 
payment terms are extended to selected customers typically during off peak times in the year in order to promote our brand name and to assure adequate product availability and to coincide with planned promotions or advertising campaigns 
although a significant amount of our sales are not affected by these terms  the extended terms do have a negative impact on our financial position and liquidity 
due to the competitiveness of the golf retail market  we believe that more customers may request payment terms and we expect to continue to selectively offer extended payment terms in the future  depending upon known industry trends and our financial condition 
we generate cash flow from operations primarily by collecting outstanding trade receivables 
because we have limited cash reserves  if collections of a significant portion of trade receivables are unexpectedly delayed  we would have a limited amount of funds available to further expand production until such time as we could collect such trade receivables 
if our cash needs in the near term exceed the available cash and cash equivalents on hand and the available borrowing under our credit facility  we would be required to obtain additional financing  which may not be available at all or in the full amounts necessary  or limit expenditures to the extent of available cash on hand  all of which could adversely effect our current growth plans 
our anticipated sources of liquidity over the next twelve months are expected to be cash reserves  projected cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility 
we anticipate that operating cash flows  current cash reserves and available borrowings will provide us with sufficient capital to fund our expected capital expenditure programs during these capital expenditure programs can be suspended or delayed at any time with minimal disruption to our operations if cash is needed in other areas of our operations 
in addition  cash flows from operations and cash reserves will be used to support ongoing purchases of component parts for our current and future product lines 
we expect that our projected cash flows from operations  current cash reserves and borrowings available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements during periods of low cash flows resulting from the seasonality of the industry 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue operations  develop  enhance and market products  retain qualified personnel  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and or liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements and it is our policy to not participate in off balance sheet transactions  including but not limited to special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and primarily consist of finished golf clubs and component parts 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and assembly overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete inventory is based upon management understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
accounting for inventories could result in material adjustments if market conditions and future demand estimates are significantly different than original assumptions  causing the reserve for obsolescence to be materially adversely affected 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the product is shipped 
at that time  the title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and the ability to collect is reasonably assured 
the ability to collect is evaluated on an individual customer basis taking into consideration historical payment trends  current financial position  results of independent credit evaluations and payment terms 
if the ability to collect decreases significantly  including but not limited to  due to the current global economic recession  our revenue would be adversely affected 
additionally  an estimate of product returns and warranty costs are recorded when revenue is recognized 
estimates are based on historical trends taking into consideration current market conditions  customer demands and product sell through 
we also record estimated reductions in revenue for sales programs such as co op advertising and spiff incentives 
estimates in the sales program accruals are based on program participation and forecast of future product demand 
if actual sales returns and sales programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowances  our sales would be adversely affected 
we recognize deferred revenue as a result of sales that have extended terms and a right of return of the product under a specified program 
once the product under the deferred revenue program is paid for and all revenue recognition criteria have been met  we record revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management using an evaluation methodology involving both overall and specific identification 
we evaluate each individual customer and measure various key aspects of the customer such as  but not limited to  their overall credit risk via experian and dun bradstreet reports  payment history  track record for meeting payment plans  industry communications  the portion of the customer balance that is past due and other various items 
from an overall perspective  we also look at the aging of the receivables in total and aging relative to prior periods to determine the appropriate reserve requirements 
fluctuations in the reserve requirements will occur from period to period as the change in customer mix or strength of the customers could affect the reserve disproportionately compared to the total change in the accounts receivable balance 
based on management assessment  we provide for estimated uncollectable amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to the valuation allowance 
balances which remain outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable 
we generally do not require collateral 
accounting for an allowance for doubtful accounts could be significantly affected as a result of a deviation in our assessment of any one or more of our customers financial strength 
product warranty our golf equipment is sold under warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year 
an allowance for estimated future warranty costs is recorded in the period products are sold 
in estimating our future warranty obligations  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated warranty policies  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair the product 
accounting for product warranty reserve could be adversely affected if one or more of our products were to fail ie broken shaft  broken head  etc 
to a significant degree above and beyond our historical product failure rates  which determine the product warranty accruals 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
fasb asc prescribes the use of the liability method where by deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
due to our historical operating results  management is unable to conclude on a more likely than not basis that all deferred income tax assets generated from net operating losses and other deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  due to our recent earnings history  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we have recognized a valuation allowance equal to a portion of the deferred income tax asset for which realization is uncertain 
we file tax returns with us federal and state jurisdictions and are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years before impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the years ended december  and  there was no impairment of long lived assets
