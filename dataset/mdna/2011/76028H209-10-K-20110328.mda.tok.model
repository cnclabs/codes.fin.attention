item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview repros therapeutics inc the company  rprx  repros  or we  us or our was organized on august  we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new drugs to treat hormonal and reproductive system disorders 
our primary product candidate  androxal  is a single isomer of clomiphene citrate and is an orally active proprietary small molecule compound 
we are developing androxal for men of reproductive age with low testosterone levels 
androxal treats the underlying mechanism that causes secondary hypogonadism and restores normal testicular function 
in addition  we are conducting a phase clinical trial of androxal as a potential treatment for type diabetes 
on november   we held a type b meeting with the food and drug administration fda to discuss whether the fda would review our protocols for a phase trial of androxal in men with secondary hypogonadism under a special protocol assessment spa 
in the meeting  the fda recommended that a phase b study in men with secondary hypogonadism but na ve to testosterone treatment be conducted if the company desired the protocols to be reviewed under an spa 
the fda further opined that such phase b study would provide for a more solid data base for design of phase studies and eventual approval of such studies under an spa 
in our patient phase b proof of concept clinical trial which was initiated in the second quarter of  we monitored the effects of androxal on male fertility and testicular function in patients being treated for low testosterone as compared to testim  a popular marketed topical testosterone medication 
this trial showed that androxal was able to maintain sperm counts in men being treated for their low testosterone levels  whereas testim resulted in suppressed sperm levels 
on january   we announced that we have received investigation review board irb approval to commence the phase b study of androxal in men with secondary hypogonadism  and we have begun enrolling patients 
depending on the rate of subject enrollment  we hope to have the study completed by the end of our findings from a retrospective review of the clinical data from our patient non pivotal phase clinical trial showed that androxal therapy resulted in a significant reduction in mean fasting plasma glucose levels in men with glucose levels greater than mg dl at the outset of the trial  an outcome not seen in the placebo or androgel arms of this study 
based on these results  in april  we submitted a white paper to the division of reproductive and urology products 
the data demonstrated that among subjects with a serum glucose of greater than or equal to mg dl  there was a higher response rate to treatment in the androxal group than the placebo or androgel groups  and the reduction in fasting serum glucose in this group was statistically significant 
in november  after the fda reviewed this paper we received guidance from them suggesting that we open a new investigational new drug application ind with the division of metabolic and endocrine products dmep for the investigation of androxal as a potential treatment for type diabetes 
in december  we submitted an ind to dmep for the investigation of androxal for such purpose 
on february   we received confirmation from dmep that our ind was accepted and  as a result  we have initiated our phase trial 
we hope that the study will be fully enrolled by the end of the third quarter proellex  our product candidate for female reproductive health  is a new chemical entity that acts as a selective blocker of the progesterone receptor and is being developed for the treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
we have conducted numerous studies with proellex enrolling over women  roughly of whom were dosed with the drug 
up until the summer of  all side effects exhibited in the studies were considered manageable and the benefit of proellex far outweighed the risk 
however  in phase efficacy and larger phase safety studies in diverse populations  a small number of subjects exhibited serious adverse effects associated with elevated liver enzymes 
as a result of these findings  we elected to stop the trials and the fda subsequently placed proellex on full clinical hold 
all women that experienced elevated liver enzymes and returned for follow up visits returned to baseline conditions with no overnight hospitalization necessary 
an analysis of all the subjects that experienced such serious adverse effects showed that the effect only occurred in a small percentage of subjects that were exposed to the mg dose of the drug for any period of time 
based on these findings  the company petitioned the fda to allow it to conduct a low dose study to demonstrate both safety and signals of efficacy in low oral doses of proellex  up to mg administered per day 
the fda upgraded the full clinical hold to a partial hold to allow the low dose study to be conducted  which we have since commenced 
we believe we can complete this trial by year end in addition  the company has undertaken two related initiatives presently at the preclinical stage 
the first is the exploration of vaginal delivery as an alternative administrative route to bypass first pass liver effects and reduce systemic exposure 
the second is the screening of second generation molecules that do not possess the specific structures the company believes induced the liver toxicity exhibited at higher doses of proellex 
we continue limited out licensing efforts for our phentolamine based product candidates  including vasomax  which had previously been approved for marketing in several countries in latin america for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction under the brand name  z max 
vasomax has been on partial clinical hold in the us since  and no further development activities are planned 
the clinical development of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking  and many products that begin the clinical development process do not obtain regulatory approval 
the costs associated with our clinical trials may be impacted by a number of internal and external factors  including the number and complexity of clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval  the number of eligible patients necessary to complete our clinical trials and any difficulty in enrolling these patients  and the length of time to complete our clinical trials 
given the uncertainty of these potential costs  we recognize that the total costs we will incur for the clinical development of our product candidates may exceed our current estimates as with most biotechnology companies with drug candidates in development  the path to marketing approval by the fda and comparable foreign agencies for each such candidate is long and uncertain 
the regulatory process  both domestically and abroad  is a multi year process with no certainty when and if a drug candidate will be approved for commercial use 
the development path for a particular drug candidate typically includes a variety of clinical trials 
while we have a general estimate of the timeframe for our clinical trials  the actual anticipated completion dates for each of our drug candidates are uncertain due to a wide variety of risks  including those described in the risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the length of time for a clinical trial may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
a clinical hold  can also result in unpredictable delays and added costs 
we will not receive any revenue from commercial sales unless we  or a potential partner  complete the clinical trial process  obtain regulatory approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
similarly  we do not have a reasonable basis to predict when or if material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates will occur 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our drug candidates to any material extent and in fact may never do so 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs of completing the development of the company s drug candidates  see the section titled risk factors 
our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  and depend on  among other factors  our ability to be successful in our clinical trials  the regulatory approval process in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions and the ability to complete new licenses and product development agreements 
the timing of our revenues may not match the timing of our associated product development expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded revenue in any particular period and or fiscal year 
as of december   we had accumulated losses of million  approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and our accounts payable and accrued expenses were approximately million 
on february   we completed a public offering of our common stock  series a warrants to purchase common stock and series b warrants to purchase common stock which resulted in approximately million in gross proceeds to us  after the underwriting discount and before offering expenses 
see overview recent developments for a description of such offering 
we believe we have sufficient funding to complete all of the phase and b clinical trials currently planned or underway  however  significant additional capital will be required for us to complete development of either of our product candidates 
we continue to explore potential additional financing alternatives including corporate partnering opportunities that would provide sufficient funds to enable us to continue to develop our two product candidates through completion of the outlined clinical trials  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any such additional funds on a timely basis or at all 
the foregoing and other matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
on february   we entered into an equity distribution agreement the equity distribution agreement with ladenburg thalmann co 
inc ladenburg  pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time through ladenburg  as sales agent and or principal  shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million the atm shares 
ladenburg is not required to sell on our behalf any specific number or dollar amount of the atm shares  but ladenburg  upon acceptance of written instructions from us  agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its customary trading and sales practices  to sell the atm shares up to the amount specified  and otherwise in accordance with the terms of a placement notice delivered to ladenburg 
we have no obligation to sell any atm shares under the equity distribution agreement  and may at any time suspend sales under the equity distribution agreement  provided that such suspension shall not affect either party s obligations with respect to the atm shares sold prior to the receipt of notice of such suspension 
ladenburg receives a commission of of the gross sales price of all atm shares sold through it under the equity distribution agreement 
the atm shares are issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s  as amended file no 

cumulative through december   we have sold  atm shares at a weighted average share price of  for proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
pursuant to general instruction ib of form s  we may not sell more than one third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non affiliates during a period of calendar months immediately prior to  and including  the date of such sale of such common stock 
due to this limitation  we announced on august  that we had suspended this atm offering of company securities 
additionally  on december  we announced our decision to reinstate our offering of the atm shares 
as a result  we sold  atm shares at a weighted average share price of in january  for proceeds of approximately  net of expenses 
on october   the company effected a one for four reverse split of its common stock 
the split adjusted shares of the company s common stock began trading on the nasdaq capital market on october  the one for four reverse split converted all shares of the company s common stock issued and outstanding  plus all outstanding stock options and the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the company s approved stock plans 
the number of authorized shares of common stock was not affected by the reverse split 
the reverse split enabled the company to meet the continued listing rules of the nasdaq capital market as evidenced by the compliance letter received from nasdaq on october  all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of  units including the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option  consisting of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  series a warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and series b warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  at a price per unit of 
each unit consisted of four shares of our common stock  series a warrants exercisable for three shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and series b warrants exercisable for shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
gross proceeds to us  after the underwriting discount and before offering expenses  were approximately million 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market under our ticker symbol rprx 
we have full time employees who utilize the services of contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and various consultants to assist us in performing clinical and regulatory services for the clinical development of our products 
we are substantially dependent on our various contract groups to adequately perform the activities required to obtain regulatory approval of our products 
the value of the tax asset associated with the december  accumulated deficit can be substantially diminished in value to us due to various tax regulations  including change in control provisions in the tax code 
for additional information relating to our net operating loss carryforward  see note federal income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  in research and development activities related to efforts to develop our products and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the transition from a development stage company to the successful introduction of commercially viable products 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend on  among other things  successfully completing the clinical development of our products in a reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost  obtaining regulatory approvals  establishing marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities or collaborative arrangements with others that possess such capabilities  our and our partners ability to realize value from our research and development programs through the commercialization of those products and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained

critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
please see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies 
a brief summary of our accounting policies is provided below 
capitalized patent costs the company capitalizes the cost associated with building its patent library for its androxal product 
as of december  and  other assets consist of capitalized patent costs in the amount of million and  respectively 
patent costs  which include legal and application costs related to the patent portfolio  are being amortized over the lesser of years or the estimated economic life of the patent 
amortization of patent cost expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
all of the million in capitalized patent costs as of december  related to androxal patent and patent application costs 
we review capitalized patent and patent application costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the patent are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the patent cost as compared to its estimated fair value 
due to the clinical hold on proellex and the uncertainty of future cash flows related to the proellex patent applications  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in related to these patent applications 
additionally  the company concluded that it will no longer seek to protect the specific matter covered in certain androxal patent applications and recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in to abandon these patent applications 
these charges were recorded in research and development expenses on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the remaining capitalized patent and patent application costs relating to androxal can continue to be used  outlicensed or sold to third parties for at least an amount management believes is sufficient to recover the carrying value of the capitalized patent costs 
should the company not continue development of androxal or should the company not continue as a going concern  the remaining capitalized patent and patent application costs may not be recoverable  which would result in charges to operating results in future periods 
accrued expenses we estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for clinical trials  preclinical development and manufacturing of clinical materials 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials or services provided and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in our trials  and we recognize this cost over the estimated term of the study based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with patient enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
however  subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals  which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations 
r d expense r d expenses include salaries and related employee expenses  contracted regulatory affairs activities  insurance coverage for clinical trials and prior product sales  contracted research and consulting fees  facility costs and internal research and development supplies 
we expense research and development costs in the period they are incurred 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects as well as fees paid to various entities that perform research on our behalf 
share based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans at december   the non employee directors stock option plan  or director plan and the stock option plan  or plan 
accounting standards generally require the recognition of the cost of employee services for share based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
expected volatility is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices for a period equal to the expected term 
the expected volatility assumption is adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and falls between the options vesting and contractual expiration dates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a zero coupon us treasury bond whose maturity period equals the option s expected term 
income taxes we have had net operating losses since inception and  therefore  have not been subject to federal income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of research and development tax credits 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
additionally  approximately million of nols  and approximately  of research and development tax credits  expired in accounting standards require the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
however  a valuation allowance must be recorded for deferred tax assets whose recovery is deemed unlikely 
as we have incurred net operating losses since inception  and there is no certainty of future revenues  our deferred tax assets have been reserved in full in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  if the company has an opportunity to use this nol to off set tax liabilities in the future  the use of this asset would be restricted based on internal revenue service  state and local nol use guidelines 
the company s public offerings completed on february   october   september   october   february   the sale and issuance of the atm shares and the issuance of unregistered shares as part of the settlement agreements we entered into with certain of our creditors since october of may have created a change of ownership for federal income tax purposes 
the company has not undertaken a study to determine if this has occurred 
a change in ownership for federal income tax purposes may result in a limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues and other income total revenues and other income decreased to  in as compared to  for this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of  in other income

we are currently developing androxal as a treatment for men of reproductive age with low testosterone 
in addition  we received confirmation on february  from dmep that our ind was accepted for the investigation of androxal as a potential treatment for type diabetes 
as a result  we have initiated a phase trial 
before the clinical hold on further proellex development in august  we were developing proellex for three indications which included a pre surgical treatment of anemia associated with uterine fibroids  a chronic treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids and as a chronic treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis 
in june  the fda notified us that the full clinical hold on proellex had been revised to a partial clinical hold to allow us to run a single study to explore both safety and efficacy in an escalating dose fashion 
as a result  we have initiated an escalating dose study and began dosing subjects in the third quarter of the decrease in androxal and proellex clinical development expenses is primarily due to the decreased clinical development expenses related to proellex as a result of the discontinuation of all clinical trials in august due to the fda s clinical hold on proellex

we will require substantial funds for research and development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  and to commence sales and marketing efforts if appropriate  if the fda or other regulatory approvals are obtained 
based on our existing and projected accounts payable and commitments  we believe we will need to raise additional capital by the end of the second quarter of in order to continue operations on a normal basis 
if our expenses are greater than expected or our revenues are less than expected  we may be required to raise additional funds prior to that time 
we believe we can secure additional cash resources through the sale of our equity securities  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise sufficient capital
