statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical fact  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risks factors in part i of this report 
results of operations the composite measure of our financial performance in the consolidated statements of operations is captioned increase in net assets from operations and consists of three elements 
the first is net investment income  which is the difference between income from interest  dividends and fees and its combined operating and interest expenses  net of applicable income taxes 
the second element is net realized gain loss on investments  which is the difference between the proceeds received from disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost  net of applicable income tax expense based on the company s tax year 
the third element is the net increase in unrealized appreciation of investments  which is the net change in the market or fair value of the company s investment portfolio  compared with stated cost 
it should be noted that the net realized gain loss on investments and net increase in unrealized appreciation of investments are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain  a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being unrealized to being realized 
conversely  when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security  an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs 
net investment income for the year ended march   total investment income was  a  or  increase over the  of total investment income for the year ended march  this comparable period increase was primarily attributable to a  or increase in dividend income and a  or increase in interest income  partially offset by a  or decrease in management and director fee income 
for the year ended march   total investment income was  a  or  decrease over the  of total investment income for the year ended march  this comparable period decrease was primarily attributable to the  or  decrease in dividend income 
this decrease was the result of a one time dividend of  paid by heelys  inc in our fiscal the company s principal objective is to achieve capital appreciation 
therefore  a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential return from equity participation and provides minimal current yield in the form of interest or dividends 
the company also earns interest income from the short term investment of cash funds  and the annual amount of such income varies based upon the average level of funds invested during the year and fluctuations in short term interest rates 
during the three years ended march  the company also had interest income from temporary cash investments of  in   in and  in the company also receives management fees primarily from its controlled affiliates which aggregated  in   in and  in the comparable period decrease of  or is primarily due to the sale of lifemark group in june during the three years ended march  the company recorded dividend income from the following sources years ended march alamo group  inc balco  inc dennis tool company encore wire corporation heelys  inc kimberly clark corporation the rectorseal corporation tci holdings  inc the whitmore manufacturing company other due to the nature of its business  the majority of the company s operating expenses are related to employee and director compensation  office expenses  legal  professional and accounting fees and the net pension benefit 
total operating expenses  increased by  or during the year ended march   while total operating expenses increased by  or during the year ended march  the increase in is due primarily to the creation of two new officer positions  as well as bonuses paid  stock options granted  and an increase in remediation costs related to the bowie plant  a prior portfolio holding 
net realized gain loss on investments net realized gain on investments was  after income tax expense of  during the year ended march   compared with a gain of  after income tax expense of  during fiscal and a gain of  after income tax expense of  during fiscal during the twelve months ended march   we sold all of our shares of common stock of lifemark group to northstar memorial group llc resulting in net cash proceeds of  and  of real estate and assets  which were directly transferred to capstar holdings corporation  our controlled affiliate created to hold assets transferred from lifemark group at time of sale 
transfer taxes in the amount of  related to the transfer of real estate were deducted from the realized gain on the lifemark transaction 
management does not attempt to maintain a consistent level of realized gains from year to year  but instead attempts to maximize total investment portfolio appreciation 
this strategy often dictates the long term holding of portfolio securities in pursuit of increased values and increased unrealized appreciation  but may at opportune times dictate realizing gains or losses through the disposition of certain portfolio investments 
net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation of investments for the three years ended march   the company recorded an increase in unrealized appreciation of investments of  in  an increase in unrealized appreciation of investments of  in and a decrease of  in  in each case compared to the prior fiscal year 
this change in unrealized appreciation of investments for the year ended march  includes a  reduction related to the aforementioned sale of lifemark group 
excluding the lifemark group  net unrealized appreciation of investments for the year ended march  increased by  as explained in the first paragraph of results of operations above  the realization of gains or losses results in a corresponding decrease or increase in unrealized appreciation of investments 
set forth in the following table are the significant increases and decreases in unrealized appreciation excluding the effect of gains or losses realized during the year by portfolio company for securities held at the end of each year 
years ended march alamo group  inc all components  inc encore wire corporation heelys  inc the whitmore manufacturing company media recovery  inc palm harbor homes  inc the rectorseal corporation as shown in the table for the year ended march   we recognized significant increases in several of our largest investments 
the largest increases in unrealized appreciation are attributable to rectorseal corporation  which increased  and the whitmore manufacturing company  which increased  due to improved earnings  media recovery  inc  which increased  due to earnings improvement and reduced debt  encore wire corporation  which increased  and alamo group  which increased  due to increases in their respective stock prices 
offsetting the increases were a  decrease in palm harbor homes  inc  reflecting depressed market conditions within the housing industry which caused palm harbor to file for chapter bankruptcy protection 
a description of the investments listed above and other material components of the investment portfolio are included elsewhere in this report under the caption consolidated schedule of investments march  and in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
portfolio investments during the year ended march   the company invested   in cash and  non cash  consisting of  in transferred real estate and assets from sale of lifemark group  inc and  in preferred stock in phi health  inc resulting from the conversion of cmi holding company  inc notes as part of its friendly foreclosure transaction 
in various portfolio securities listed elsewhere in this item under the caption portfolio changes during the year ended march   which also lists dispositions of portfolio securities 
during the and fiscal years  the company invested a total of  and  respectively 
financial liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
pursuant to the sba regulations  cash and cash equivalents of million held by csvc may not be transferred or advanced to csc without the consent of the sba 
with the exception of a capital gain distribution made in the form of a distribution of the stock of a portfolio company in the fiscal year ended march   the company has elected to retain all gains realized during its years of operations 
retention of future gains is viewed as an important source of funds to sustain the company s investment activity 
approximately million of the company s investment portfolio is represented by unrestricted publicly traded securities and represents a source of liquidity 
funds to be used by the company for operating or investment purposes may be transferred in the form of dividends or management fees from the rectorseal corporation and the whitmore manufacturing company  controlled affiliates of the company  to the extent of their available cash reserves and borrowing capacities 
management believes that the company s cash and cash equivalents and cash available from other sources described above are adequate to meet its expected requirements 
consistent with the long term strategy of the company  the disposition of investments from time to time may also be an important source of funds for future investment activities 
contractual obligations as shown below  the company had the following contractual obligations as of march  for information on our capital commitments see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total year years more than years operating lease obligations critical accounting policies valuation of investments in accordance with the investment company act of  investments in unrestricted securities freely marketable securities having readily available market quotations are valued at market and investments in restricted securities securities subject to one or more resale restrictions are valued at fair value determined in good faith by the company s board of directors 
under the valuation policy of the company  unrestricted securities are valued at the closing sale price for nyse listed securities and at the lower of the closing bid price or the last sale price for nasdaq securities on the valuation date 
restricted securities  including securities of publicly owned companies which are subject to restrictions on resale  are valued at fair value  which is considered to be the amount the company may reasonably expect to receive if such securities were sold on the valuation date 
valuations as of any particular date  however  are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other dispositions of securities 
among the factors considered by the board of directors in determining the fair value of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  the long term potential of the business of the issuer  the market for and recent sales prices of the issuer s securities  the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses  the proportion of the issuer s securities owned by the company  the nature and duration of resale restrictions and the nature of any rights enabling the company to require the issuer to register restricted securities under applicable securities laws 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that its business is materially affected by inflation  other than the impact which inflation may have on the securities markets  the valuations of business enterprises and the relationship of such valuations to underlying earnings  all of which will influence the value of the company s investments 
bdc risks pursuant to section b of the investment company act of  a bdc is required to describe the risk factors involved in an investment in the securities of such company due to the nature of the company s investment portfolio 
accordingly the company states that the company s objective is to achieve capital appreciation through investments in businesses believed to have favorable growth potential 
such businesses are often undercapitalized small companies which lack management depth and have not yet attained profitability 
the company s venture investments often include securities which do not yield interest or dividends and are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale  which restrictions adversely affect the liquidity and marketability of such securities 
because of the speculative nature of the company s investments and the lack of any market for the securities initially purchased by the company  there is a significantly greater risk of loss than is the case with traditional investment securities 
the high risk  long term nature of the company s venture investment activities may prevent shareholders of the company from achieving price appreciation and dividend distributions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in marketable equity security prices 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
our investment performance is a function of our portfolio companies profitability  which may be affected by economic cycles  competitive forces  foreign currency fluctuations and production costs including labor rates  raw material prices and certain basic commodity prices 
most of the companies in our investment portfolio do not hedge their exposure to raw material and commodity price fluctuations 
however  the portfolio company with the greatest exposure to foreign currency fluctuations generally hedges its exposure 
all of these factors may have an adverse effect on the value of our investments and on our net asset value 
our investment in portfolio securities includes fixed rate debt securities which totaled  at march   equivalent to of the value of our total investments 
generally  these debt securities are below investment grade and have relatively high fixed rates of interest  therefore  minor changes in market yields of publicly traded debt securities have little or no effect on the values of debt securities in our portfolio and no effect on interest income 
our investments in debt securities are generally held to maturity and their fair values are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
a portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt and equity securities of private companies 
we anticipate little or no effect on the values of these investments from modest changes in public market equity valuations 
should significant changes in market valuations of comparable publicly traded companies occur  there may be a corresponding effect on valuations of private companies  which would affect the value and the amount and timing of proceeds eventually realized from these investments 
a portion of our investment portfolio also consists of restricted common stocks of publicly traded companies 
the fair values of these restricted securities are influenced by the nature of applicable resale restrictions  the underlying earnings and financial condition of the issuers of such restricted securities and the market valuations of comparable publicly traded companies 
a portion of our investment portfolio also consists of unrestricted  freely marketable common stocks of publicly traded companies 
these freely marketable investments  which are valued at the public market price  are directly exposed to equity price risks  in that a change in an issuer s public market equity price would result in an identical change in the value of our investment in such security
