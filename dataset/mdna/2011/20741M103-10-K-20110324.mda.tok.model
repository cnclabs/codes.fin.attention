general conmed was formed as a corporation on june  in the state of maryland for the purpose of providing healthcare services exclusively to county detention centers located in maryland 
as the company developed  it accepted more contracts for additional services including mental health  pharmacy and out of facility healthcare 
by  conmed served more than of the county detention healthcare services market in maryland 
in  the company began to expand outside of maryland and by operated in four states kansas  maryland  virginia and washington 
on january   conmed went public through a reverse merger with pace  a shell company with no ongoing operations 
on march   the public shell changed its name to conmed healthcare management  inc in  the company purchased all of the assets of emergency medicine documentation consultants  pc emdc  a provider of medical services in northwest oregon  and purchased all of the stock of cmhs  a provider of mental health services in maryland 
as of december   the company was in contract with  and providing medical services in counties in seven states including arizona  kansas  maryland  oklahoma  oregon  virginia and washington and for the fiscal year ended december  had net revenues primarily from medical services provided to correctional institutions of million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is as follows goodwill we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred  the company is required to perform an impairment test on goodwill 
the first step tests for impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we perform our annual analysis on december of each fiscal year and there was no impairment at december  or revenue recognition our principal source of revenue is contracts to provide medical assistance to county and municipal correctional facilities 
deferred revenue represents amounts that may be paid in advance of delivery under these contracts 
most of our contracts call for a fixed monthly fee 
in addition  most contracts have incremental charges based on the adp of the correctional facility or a contractual fee adjustment based on the adp 
revenues from contracts are recognized ratably for fixed fees  or monthly for contracts with variable charges based on adp 
the timing of each payment varies per contract 
credit terms are not more than thirty days from the date of invoice 
certain contracts provide for monthly fee adjustments to reflect any missed hours of work required under terms of the contract 
in addition  we may incur liquidated damages related to specific performance measurements required under the contract that we have failed to meet 
reductions in monthly fees resulting from staffing adjustments and liquidated damages are recorded by us as reductions to revenue 
certain contracts include stop loss limits  which create a ceiling to our financial responsibility for an individual inmate s care or a maximum amount in the aggregate for certain categories of medical expenses  whereby we are protected from catastrophic medical losses 
in circumstances where a stop loss is reached  we are reimbursed for any costs incurred over the predetermined stop loss amount 
any reimbursement received by us is recorded as revenue 
accrued medical claims liability medical expenses include the costs associated with medical services provided by off site medical providers  pharmacy  laboratory and radiology fees  professional and general liability insurance as well as other generally related medical expenses 
the cost of medical services provided  administered or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in part on estimates for unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date 
the company estimates an accrual for unbilled medical services using available utilization data including hospitalization  one day surgeries  physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and other related costs 
additionally  company personnel review certain inpatient hospital stays and other high cost medical procedures and expenses in order to attempt to identify costs in excess of the historical average rates 
once identified  reserves are determined which take into consideration the specific facts available at that time 
actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the company s current estimates 
the differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the company s future claims experience 
changes in estimates of claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between estimates and actual claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed 
stock compensation compensation expense for stock based awards is recorded over the vesting period at the fair value of the award at the time of grant 
the recording of such compensation began on january  for shares not yet vested as of that date and for all new grants subsequent to that date 
the exercise price of options granted under our incentive plans is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date 
we assume no projected forfeitures on stock based compensation  since actual historical forfeiture rates on our stock based incentive awards have been negligible 
income taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
recently adopted accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the update provides amendments to fasb accounting standards codification  fair value  which requires entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  the update requires entities to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the disclosures related to level and level fair value measurements became effective for us in and the disclosures related to level fair value measurements are effective for us in the update requires new disclosures and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

revenue improvement totaling approximately  or of the increase  resulted primarily from expansion of the services provided under a number of our existing contracts in which we were providing services prior to price increases related to existing service requirements totaled approximately  or of the revenue increase 
partially offsetting the revenue increases above were decreases in other volume related activities totaling  or of the revenue increase  primarily associated with lower inmate populations at certain facilities partially offset by an increase in stop loss reimbursements due to higher out of facility medical expenditures in excess of stop loss limits which are billed back to clients

the increase in spending for medical expenses in absolute dollars primarily reflects expenditures related to medical services both in and out of facility as well as pharmacy services 
the increase in medical expenses as a percentage of revenue results  in part  from the new service contracts added since january  that are primarily full service contracts and  as a result  included a higher proportion of medical expense when compared to existing contracts 
out of facility hospital expenses were higher than the prior year reflecting an increase in the number of hospitalization days when compared to additionally  expenses for providing pharmacy services for existing service contracts increased due to increases in pharmaceutical prices as well as an increase in hiv treatment expenditures compared to the prior period

gain loss on fair value of derivatives as a result of adopting derivative accounting for certain warrants which contain an exercise price adjustment feature effective january    of our then issued and outstanding common stock purchase warrants previously treated as equity were no longer afforded equity treatment and as a result they are now recorded as a liability based on fair value estimates 
these common stock purchase warrants do not trade in an active securities market  and as such  we estimate the fair value of these warrants using the black scholes option pricing model and all changes in the fair value of these warrants will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised  amended or expire 
as such  on january   we recorded a cumulative adjustment to reclassify  from additional paid in capital and  from retained earnings and recorded a  long term warrant liability to recognize the fair value of such warrants on such date 
during the twelve months ended december  and  we recognized a  unrealized gain and a  unrealized loss  respectively 
the decreased expense of  was primarily the result of our stock price decreasing during the twelve months ended december  compared to a stock price increase during the twelve months ended december  additionally  there were  fewer warrants subject to fair value accounting as of december  compared to december   primarily due to the amendment of certain warrant agreements to remove the provisions that resulted in liability treatment 
during the twelve months ended december   no warrants were exercised and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were amended to remove the exercise price adjustment feature and are now treated as equity 
as of december   we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock that remain subject to derivative accounting 
during the twelve months ended december   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised generating  of net proceeds and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised by cashless exercise and as a result  a total of  shares of common stock were issued 
during the year ended december   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were amended to remove the provisions that resulted in liability treatment and are now treated as equity 
the following table summarizes the change in fair value for the twelve months ended december fair value of warrants outstanding as of january realized loss on warrants unrealized gain loss on warrants fair value of warrants transferred to equity upon amendment fair value of warrants exercised fair value of warrants outstanding as of december income tax expense our effective tax rate was during the twelve months ended december  which differs from the expected tax rate of primarily due to permanent differences related to stock based compensation and derivatives related to warrants 
the change in our effective tax rate from prior periods is primarily due to the relation of our taxable income relative to pre tax income 
we recorded income tax expense of  for the twelve months ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  as the result of reversing the valuation allowance of  and an increase in net deferred tax assets of  our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax rate primarily due to permanent differences related to stock based compensation  change in valuation allowance and derivatives related to warrants 
management evaluated all available evidence  both negative and positive  and determined that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets  excluding net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards due to limitations on change of control under section of the irc  will be realized and a valuation allowance is not required based upon the following the company s history of generating taxable income  taxable income has been increasing year over year since the company became public  and management projects taxable income continuing to increase and believes that it is more likely than not that the company can continue to generate taxable income in the foreseeable future
