item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for aerospace and defense electronics and truck components and assemblies 
we are organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components and assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
revenue for the electronics group is derived primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace and defense electronics 
our objective is to become the leading outsourcing specialist in each of our core markets for aerospace and defense electronics  and truck components and assemblies 
we have focused our efforts on establishing long term relationships with industry leaders who embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition in the industrial group  including cost of sales  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback  which is deemed uncollectible 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review 
the company assesses recoverability using several methodologies  including a discounted cash flow analysis and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted at rates consistent with the cost of capital specific to the reporting unit 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit and is added to the present value of the forecasted cash flows 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which a reporting unit s cash flow is projected to grow beyond the period covered by the long range plan 
the cash flow analysis requires judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculation 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  
table of contents growth rates and discount rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the sum of the calculated fair values of each reporting unit is then reconciled and compared to our total market capitalization  allowing for a reasonable control premium 
if the discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we proceed to step two of the impairment process 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
there were no indicators of impairment for the electronics group  which is the only remaining reporting unit with goodwill 
while revenue for this reporting unit decreased year over year  profit margins improved to significantly offset the impact of the net revenue decline 
the fair value estimate for the electronics group exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate of our electronics group during the fourth quarter were the expected after tax cash flows for the period from to  a terminal growth rate of and a weighted average cost of capital of 
the terminal rate is consistent with the prior year growth rate of 
our analysis included a comparison of our market capitalization to the fair value of the entire enterprise 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair values of each of our reporting units were reasonable 
however  different assumptions could materially affect the results 
net revenue and cost of sales 
net revenue of products and services under commercial terms and conditions are recorded upon delivery and passage of title  or when services are rendered 
related shipping and handling costs  if any  are included in costs of sales 
net revenue under service type contracts is recorded as costs are incurred 
net revenue under long term  fixed price contracts with aerospace and defense companies and agencies of the us government is recognized upon shipment 
contract profits are taken into earnings based on actual cost of sales for units shipped 
prior to a system conversion in  estimated contract profits were recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
the change to recognizing costs on an actual basis from an estimated basis did not have a material impact to our financial statements and result of operations 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue when such costs are invoiced to the customer 
long lived asset impairment 
we perform periodic impairment analysis on our long lived amortizable assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when indicators are present  we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to their carrying amount 
if the operations are determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of their assets  the long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment test  principally in determining whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review 
we recorded an immaterial amount of impairment charges in we recorded impairment charges of million in within the industrial group 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
pension plan funded status 
the calculation of pension assets and liabilities involve complex estimation processes dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisors such as actuaries 
the assumptions used  including discount rates and return on plan assets  have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations 
changes in these rates could significantly impact the actuarially determined amounts recorded in the statements of financial position 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents a change in the assumed pension discount rate of basis points would result in a change in our pension obligation as of december  of approximately million 
a basis point change in the assumed rate of return would change the pension expense by approximately million 
discount rates are based upon the construction of a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the future obligations 
a yield curve is based on a subset of these fixed income investments 
the projected cash flows are matched to this yield curve and a present value is developed which is then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy  at a minimum  the applicable funding regulations 
expected investment rates of return are based upon input from the plan s investment advisors and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix  historical rates of return on those assets  projected future asset class returns and long term market conditions and inflation expectations 
we believe that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation  and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate 
actuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that expected 
under applicable standards  those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized as expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over future periods 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory 
we record inventory at the lower of cost  determined under the first in  first out method  or market  and we reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period the change occurs 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions using the black scholes option pricing method  which requires the input of several subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes as required by the provisions of asc  income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
in addition  under asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded income tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  asc requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct our operations or otherwise incur taxable income or losses 
we have recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and mexico where realization has been determined to be uncertain 
however  our mexican operation  which has historically generated taxable income and expects to continue to be profitable for the foreseeable future  also has certain deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded against such assets as of december  
table of contents since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to our valuation allowance may be necessary 
results of operations we operate in two segments  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the table presented below  which compares our segment and consolidated results of operations from one year to another  presents the results for each year  the change in those results from one year to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each year as a percentage of net revenue 
the first two data columns in the table show the absolute results for each year presented 
the columns entitled year over year change and year over year percentage change show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positive and unfavorable changes as negative 
for example  when our net revenue increases from one year to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one year to the next  that change is shown as a negative number in both columns 
the last two columns in the table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenue 
in these two columns  the cost of sales and gross profit for each are given as a percentage of that segment s net revenue 
these amounts are shown in italics

table of contents net revenue 
the industrial group derives its revenue from manufacturing services and product sales 
net revenue in the industrial group increased million to million in increased volumes for medium and heavy duty commercial truck components contributed to increased revenue of approximately million 
increased volumes for trailer axle beams also resulted in a million net revenue increase from the prior year 
manufacturing services for a new commercial vehicle customer resulted in increased revenue of million for the year ended december  additionally  sales of our specialty closure products increased million 
partially offsetting the volume increase was a decline of million due to the discontinued sale of axle shafts to a light truck customer 
the electronics group derives its revenue from product sales and technical outsourced services 
net revenue in the electronics group decreased million to million in the decrease is primarily a result of the completion of shipments of certain products and the completion of several ems programs  partially offset by an increase in sales of certain data recording products 
the completed ems programs primarily consisted of circuit board assembly services provided to certain contractors for the us government 
although the electronics group continues to provide electronic manufacturing services to us prime government contractors and other subcontractors  we are pursuing those programs which align with our high reliability capabilities for aerospace and defense customers and typically involve manufacturing lower volume  higher mix components 
revenues for our electronics group are expected to remain relatively flat in the near term 
gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit increased million to a profit of million in as compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
the increase in sales volume resulted in an increase in gross profit of approximately million 
the industrial group also realized an increase in gross profit of million as a result of productivity improvements attributable to restructuring activities and an increase of million as a result of favorable employment benefit rates 
partially offsetting this was a million cost increase due to the strengthening of the mexican peso as compared to the prior year 
additionally  the discontinuation of axle shaft sales to a light truck customer reduced gross profit by million from the prior year 
the electronics group s gross profit decreased million to million in primarily as a result of lower revenues 
the electronics group also recognized sustaining engineering charges of approximately million during related to design changes on certain products shipped during the year 
our continuous improvement  lean and six sigma quality initiatives drove cost reductions which served to partially offset the gross profit change attributable to the volume decline and engineering charges 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for increased to from in  reflecting a change in mix from lower margin programs within the ems business to higher margin product and aerospace sales during the period 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million in primarily due to reductions in compensation and employee benefit costs partially offset by additional selling efforts within our electronics group 
research and development 
research and development costs increased million in in support of the electronics group s self funded product and technology development activities 
restructuring expense  net 
as a result of the company s restructuring program  we recorded million and million related to these initiatives during and  respectively 
the charge for the year ended consisted of million for employee severance and benefit costs  million in equipment relocation costs and million in other various charges  primarily related to mothball costs associated with closed or partially closed facilities and charges related to the consolidation of two electronics group locations 
the charge for the year ended consisted of million for employee severance and benefit costs  million in deferred contract costs  million in equipment relocation costs  million in non cash asset impairments  and million in other various charges 
in  we expect to incur approximately million in additional equipment relocation costs  and approximately million in other exit costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
interest expense  net 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average debt outstanding  partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rates 
our weighted average debt outstanding decreased to million during from million during the weighted average interest rate increased to in from in 
table of contents interest expense incurred on the debt required to be repaid from the net proceeds of the sale of sypris test measurement was allocated to discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   million of interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on the million in debt required to be repaid as a result of the transaction 
other income  net 
other income  net increased million to million for from million in  primarily due to the sale of idle equipment within the industrial group for a gain of million 
this was partially offset by foreign currency translation losses of million in as compared to translation gains of million in income taxes 
the income tax provision consists of current and deferred tax expense of million and million  respectively 
the current tax expense is primarily attributable to certain minimum taxes required to be paid by our mexican subsidiary 
the deferred tax expense includes an increase in the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets of million offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets of million 
the domestic valuation allowance increase is primarily due to the transfer of a liability and related deferred tax asset from our mexican subsidiary to a domestic subsidiary for which all deferred tax assets are fully reserved 
the foreign valuation allowance decrease is primarily due to the receipt of an income tax refund by our mexican subsidiary related to prior years which was previously reserved 
the income tax provision includes a benefit of million recorded due to the required intraperiod tax allocation resulting from the loss from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations 
additionally  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately million and state taxes of million related to the sale of sypris test measurement during the remaining provision recorded in is associated with our foreign subsidiaries and includes minimum taxes required to be paid in mexico 
discontinued operations 
on october   the company sold all of the outstanding stock of its wholly owned subsidiary  sypris test measurement  for approximately million 
in accordance with requirements of asc formerly sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of the test measurement segment have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
this business was previously included within the electronics group 
during the second quarter of  the company was made aware of a potential warranty claim from a former customer of sypris test measurement 
as of december   the company estimates that its total liability arising from this claim will not exceed million  which was charged to income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax for the year ended december  in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
there can be no assurance that similar potential claims will not emerge in the future or that relevant facts and circumstances will not change  necessitating future changes to the estimated liability 

table of contents quarterly results the following table presents our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended december  the quarterly results are presented on a week period basis 
we have prepared this data on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  have included all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of this information

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition there are numerous risks and uncertainties relating to the global economy and the commercial vehicle and aerospace and defense industries that could materially affect our financial condition  future results of operations and liquidity 
these risks and uncertainties could result in decreased sales  limited access to credit  rising costs  increased competition  customer or supplier bankruptcies  delays in customer payment terms and acceleration of supplier payments  growing inventories and failure to meet debt covenants 
as a result of a decline in the overall economy  we took significant actions during and to reduce our cost base and improve profitability  including various plant shutdowns and other workforce reductions 
based on our current forecast for  we expect to be able to meet the financial covenants of our amended credit agreements and have sufficient liquidity to finance our operations 
however  changing business  regulatory and economic conditions may mean that actual results will vary from our forecasts 
see our risk factors discussed in item a of this form k 
our ability to service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate this cash will depend largely on future operations 
based upon our current level of operations and our business plan  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our amended credit agreements will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
on october   the company amended its revolving credit agreement and senior notes agreements 
the loan amendment extends the maturity date of the revolving credit agreement from january  through january   while the note amendments implement the same maturity date for the senior notes 
the company used certain net proceeds from the sale of the test measurement business and of the company s holdings of dana holding corporation common stock to reduce the lending commitments under the revolving credit agreement from million to approximately million and under the senior notes from million to approximately million 
the amendments substituted new financial covenants regarding quarterly minimum net worth and liquidity levels  cumulative quarterly ebitdar levels earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and restructuring costs  cumulative quarterly fixed charge ratios and cumulative quarterly debt to ebitdar ratios  among others 
the amendments also commit the company to obtain the consent of the banks and the noteholders before making any dividend payments and impose certain fees and interest rate increases 
to the extent that marketable securities or other collateral is sold outside of the ordinary course of business  the amendments also provide for certain prepayments to the banks and the noteholders 
the company expects to be able to comply with the amended covenants 
however  no assurances can be given that changing business  regulatory or economic conditions might not cause the company to violate one or more covenants which could result in default or acceleration of any debt under the agreements 
in  we anticipate refinancing the revolving credit agreement and senior notes that mature in january with a new debt facility  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to on terms favorable to us 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million in  as compared to million in the cash flow associated with our accounts receivable and inventory during reflects the change in net revenue mix between our industrial and electronics groups 
the industrial group s net revenue increase of million resulted in cash investments in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
the electronics group s net revenue decrease of million generated cash from accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
the impact on accounts payable from the change in revenue mix was a source of cash for the industrial group of million and a use of cash by the electronics group of million 
other current assets decreased in and provided million primarily due to a million tax refund received by our mexican subsidiary and the timing of prepaid items 
accounts payable increased in and provided million primarily due to increased purchases by our industrial group and the timing of payments to our suppliers 
accrued and other liabilities decreased in and used million primarily as a result of the payout of state taxes related to the gain on discontinued operations recognized in and the payout of various restructuring accruals 
this was partially offset by various payroll and benefit related accruals 
net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations was million in as compared to net cash provided of million in net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations included 
table of contents million of capital expenditures 
additionally  the industrial group sold certain idle equipment during the year  which generated million of cash 
if revenues continue to increase within the industrial group  the company expects capital expenditures will increase in future periods to support the growth 
net cash provided by investing activities in includes net proceeds of million from the sale of the test measurement business 
additionally  we liquidated our holding of dhc common stock during the fourth quarter of for approximately million in net cash proceeds 
the company s financing activities were cash neutral for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in  primarily due to principal paydowns to reduce the outstanding debt under the revolving credit agreements and senior notes 
additionally  we paid million in financing fees in conjunction with modifications of our debt in we had total borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million at december   and an unrestricted cash balance of million 
approximately million of the unrestricted cash balance relates to our mexican subsidiaries 
maximum borrowings on the revolving credit agreement are million 
standby letters of credit up to a maximum of million may be issued under the credit agreement of which million were issued at december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources
