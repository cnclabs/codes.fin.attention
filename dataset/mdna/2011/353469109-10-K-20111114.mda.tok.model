results of operations overview of the fiscal year ended august  our fiscal financial results marked the second consecutive year of significant improvement over prior year results 
during fiscal we continued to experience broad based improvements in our training and consulting sales at nearly all of our regional offices and directly owned international offices as well as from most of our international licensees 
nearly all of our major practices and content groups had increased sales and we believe that our ongoing investments in curriculum development and increasing the size of our sales force will help us maintain this favorable momentum 
for the fiscal year ended august   our consolidated sales increased percent to million compared with million in fiscal increased sales and continued strong gross margins contributed to improved operating results in fiscal as we recognized income from operations of million compared with million in the prior year 
our income before the provision for income taxes was million  a million improvement over the million recognized in fiscal we recorded a million income tax provision during fiscal compared with million in fiscal  primarily due to increased pre tax earnings 
these improvements contributed to our improvement in net income  which totaled million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal the following information is intended to provide an overview of the primary factors that influenced our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  sales our consolidated sales from continuing operations increased million  or percent  compared to fiscal sales increased at all of our us canadian regional offices  at our government services office  at all but one of our international direct offices  in two of our three national account practices  and from increased book royalties 
royalty revenue from our international licensee partners also increased compared to the prior year 
sales improvements during the fiscal year were broad based and included nearly all of our practices and product lines 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily due to increased sales as described above 
our gross margin  which is gross profit stated as a percentage of sales  decreased slightly to percent compared with percent in fiscal operating costs our operating costs increased by million compared to fiscal  which was the net result of a million increase in selling  general  and administrative costs  a million decrease in amortization expense  and a million decrease in depreciation expense 
further details regarding these items can be found in the comparative analysis of fiscal to fiscal as discussed within this management s discussion and analysis 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income or loss before income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations year ended august  sales training and consulting services products leasing total sales cost of sales training and consulting services products leasing total cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative depreciation amortization restructuring costs impairment of assets total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes fiscal compared to fiscal sales the following table sets forth sales data from continuing operations by category and by our primary delivery channels in thousands year ended august  percent change from prior year percent change from prior year sales by category training and consulting services products leasing sales by channel us canada direct international direct international licensees national account practices self funded marketing other 
table of contents the following analysis of our sales performance for the fiscal year ended august  is based on activity through our primary delivery channels as shown above 
us canada direct this channel includes our four regional field offices that serve clients in the united states and canada and our government services group 
during fiscal we had increased sales at all of our offices in this channel  including our government services group 
sales through our regional sales offices increased by million compared with fiscal these sales increases were broad based across nearly all of our practices and training programs offered 
sales through our government services group increased million primarily due to contracts with a division of the federal government obtained during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we recognized million from these government services contracts during fiscal  which is more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues for the year 
looking forward  our pipeline of booked days and awarded revenue continues to be strong and exceeded the prior year at august  international direct our three international offices are located in australia  japan  and the united kingdom 
the improvement in international direct sales was primarily due to increased sales in japan  which increased million on a continuing operations basis compared to fiscal despite the effects of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck northern japan during march and caused our office to be closed for two weeks  we were able to recognize improved sales primarily due to increased publishing sales and the favorable impact of translating yen denominated sales to us dollars 
although the natural disaster produced increased cancelations during the fiscal year  training and consulting sales remained flat compared to the prior year 
we anticipate that the lingering effects of the earthquake and resulting economic weakness may continue to have an adverse impact on our training and consulting service sales in japan in future periods 
sales were also up million at our office in australia  and sales decreased by million at our office in the united kingdom 
international licensees in countries or foreign locations where we do not have an office  our training and consulting services are delivered through independent licensees  which may translate and adapt our curriculums to local preferences and customs  if necessary 
during fiscal  the majority of our larger foreign licensees had increased sales compared to the prior year  which resulted in a million increase in licensee royalty revenues 
however  continued civil unrest and economic uncertainty in some of the countries where our licensees operate may have adverse effects on certain licensees performance in future periods 
national account practices our national account practices are comprised of programs that are not typically offered in our regional field offices and include helping clients succeed from the sales performance group  the leader in me curriculum designed for students from our education practice  and winning customer loyalty from our customer loyalty practice 
during  we had increased sales in each of the national account practices  which was led by a million increase from our education practice 
we continue to be encouraged by the growth and client acceptance of our national account practice curriculums as we move into fiscal self funded marketing this group includes our public programs  book and audio sales  and speeches through our speakers bureau 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to royalties related to new books 
however  with the retirement of dr 
stephen r 
covey from public speaking engagements during late fiscal  we anticipate that overall speaking presentation revenues may decline in future periods 
other our other sales are comprised primarily of leasing sales and shipping and handling revenues 
the decrease in other sales was primarily due to reduced leasing revenues as certain lease contracts at our corporate headquarters expired in prior periods 
we are actively seeking new tenants for available space and have entered into new leasing arrangements during the fourth quarter of fiscal that will improve our revenues from leasing office space on our headquarters campus in future periods 

table of contents gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of services provided or the cost of goods sold 
our cost of sales includes the direct costs of conducting seminars  materials used in the production of training products and related accessories  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  the mix of training and consulting courses provided  prices of materials  labor rates  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
our consolidated gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to significantly improved sales during fiscal our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  was percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
the slight decrease in gross margin was primarily due to margins on a government services contract that included intellectual property that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal that did not repeat in the current year  increased sales of training programs that have higher costs  and decreased facilitator sales 
these factors were partially offset by increased international licensee royalty revenues 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses increased million compared with fiscal however  as a percent of sales  sg a expenses declined to percent compared to percent of sales in the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to a million increase in commissions and bonuses resulting from improved sales and financial results compared to the prior year  a million increase in salaries and related costs resulting primarily from the addition of new personnel  a million increase in share based compensation costs primarily from awards granted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million increase in conference costs from our sales and delivery conference  which has been previously held on a smaller scale  a million increase in travel expenses  and a million increase in research and development costs related to the maintenance and development of training programs and curriculum 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in costs resulting from the prior year reimbursement of airfare costs previously paid by our ceo for business travel pursuant to a change in policy approved by the board of directors  and bonuses for the income tax consequences resulting from the forgiveness of certain management stock loans 
these costs  which totaled million  did not repeat during fiscal depreciation depreciation expense decreased slightly by million compared to the prior year 
based upon anticipated capital asset acquisitions in fiscal and previous depreciation expense levels  we expect depreciation expense to total approximately million during fiscal amortization amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets decreased million due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we currently expect that intangible asset amortization expense will decrease and will total approximately million in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal of approximately percent was somewhat higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to taxable interest income on outstanding management common stock loans and the effects of uncertain tax positions 
these increases in our effective rate were partially offset by the benefit of foreign tax credits in excess of the tax on income taxed both by us and foreign jurisdictions 
we paid significant amounts of withholding tax on foreign royalties during fiscal and fiscal we also recognized taxable income on repatriated earnings from foreign income that are taxed in both foreign and domestic jurisdictions 
during fiscal  we concluded that domestic foreign tax credits 
table of contents will be available to offset our fiscal foreign withholding taxes and taxes on foreign dividends 
however  for fiscal we concluded that domestic foreign tax credits were not available to offset such taxes 
we expect that our cash paid for income taxes will remain significantly less than our income tax provision during the foreseeable future as we utilize domestic net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credit carryforwards  and other deferred income tax assets 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales our consolidated sales increased by million  or percent  compared to fiscal the following analysis of our sales performance for the fiscal year ended august  is based on activity through our primary delivery channels as described above 
us canada direct during fiscal  we had improved sales performance in this channel primarily due to increased sales from our government services group  improved sales at three of our four regional offices  increased revenue per training day  and decreased cancellation rates compared to fiscal sales through our government services group increased primarily due to governmental service contracts obtained during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized million from these contracts during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales through our regional sales offices increased million compared to fiscal international direct the decrease in international direct sales was due to reduced sales in japan  which declined million on a continuing operations basis compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset by sales increases in australia and the united kingdom 
sales in japan were impacted by a million intellectual property sale in fiscal that did not repeat in fiscal and by prevailing economic conditions in that country 
international licensees during the fiscal year ended august   nearly all of our foreign licensees had increased sales compared to the prior year 
national account practices during fiscal  each of our major components of this channel had increased sales compared to the prior year 
self funded marketing the decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased speeches delivered and reduced public program sales resulting from the decision to offer fewer programs during the fiscal year 
other the decrease in other sales was primarily due to reduced leasing revenues as certain lease contracts at our corporate headquarters expired 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit from continuing operations increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  which was due to increased sales in fiscal our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  was percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal gross margin on our training and consulting sales  which represented approximately percent of our consolidated sales in fiscal  was percent compared to percent in fiscal the increase was primarily due to sales from a government services contract that included intellectual property licenses  which typically have higher margins than other types of training and consulting sales  increased international licensee royalty revenues  which have virtually no cost of sales  and an increase in training 
table of contents and consulting sales as a percent of our consolidated sales as training and consulting sales generally have higher gross margins than product or leasing sales 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses increased by million compared to fiscal however  as a percent of sales  consolidated sg a expense decreased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to increased sales and the corresponding increase in commissions  severance costs  reimbursement of airfare costs previously paid by our ceo for business travel  and costs associated with the forgiveness of certain management stock loans 
due to the significant increase in sales during our fourth quarter of fiscal  our commissions also increased as many of our sales personnel substantially exceeded sales goals  which provides for special bonus compensation 
however  as our sales performance improves  annual sales goals are adjusted higher  which we believe provides incentive for continued growth 
of the million increase in associate costs  we believe that million was attributable to these special commissions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  it was mutually determined that our co chief operating officers would terminate their employment with the company 
as a result of this decision  we paid the former co chief operating officers severance according to our corporate policy  which totaled million 
during fiscal we also expensed million for the reimbursement of airfare costs previously paid by our ceo for business travel pursuant to a change in policy approved by the board of directors 
we also expensed million related to bonuses for the income tax consequences resulting from the forgiveness of certain management stock loans during the fiscal year 
increased sg a expenses as described above were partially offset by the decreases in the following areas our advertising and promotional expenses decreased million primarily due to the decision to reduce the number of public programs held and strategic reductions in our overall marketing expenses  our telephone and overall utility charges decreased by million primarily due to cost savings initiatives  our spending on computer  office  and other related items declined by million  and we experienced reduced expenses in various other areas of our operations resulting from our cost cutting efforts 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to impaired accounting software costs that resulted in an additional million depreciation charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal which did not repeat in fiscal and the full depreciation of other capital assets during the year 
income taxes our income tax provision attributed to continuing operations for the fiscal year ended august  totaled million on pre tax earnings of million 
our effective tax rate on continuing operations of approximately percent is higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to foreign withholding taxes for which we concluded we could not utilize a foreign tax credit  the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program  disallowed executive compensation  and actual and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries for which we also concluded that we could not utilize foreign tax credits 
these items and other differences added approximately million to our income tax provision for fiscal segment review our sales are primarily comprised of training and consulting sales and related products 
based on the consistent nature of our services and products and the types of customers for these services  we function as a single operating segment 
however  to improve comparability with previous periods  operating information for our us canada  international  and corporate services operations is presented below 
our us canada operations are responsible for the sale and delivery of our training and consulting services in the united states and canada 
our international sales group includes the financial results of our foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees

liquidity and capital resources summary at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at august  and our net working capital current assets less current liabilities increased significantly to million compared with million at august  our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the sale of services in the normal course of business and proceeds from our revolving line of credit and new term loan 
our primary uses of liquidity include payments for operating activities  capital expenditures  working capital  acquisition earn outs  and debt repayment 
on march   we entered into an amended and restated secured credit agreement the restated credit agreement with our existing lender 
the restated credit agreement provides a revolving line of credit facility the revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of million and a term loan the term loan with maximum available borrowing of million 
both credit facilities may be used for general business purposes 
the key terms and conditions of the revolving loan and term loan are as follows revolving loan the million revolving loan matures on march  we may draw on the revolving loan and repay amounts borrowed in unlimited repetition up to the maximum allowed amount so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is libor plus per annum 
term loan the term loan allows us to borrow up to million through september  the draw period 
following the close of the draw period  the amount borrowed on the term loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments  commencing on october  and concluding on september  during the draw period  we borrowed million from the term loan 
the interest rate on the term loan is libor plus per annum 
the restated credit agreement requires us to be in compliance with specified financial covenants  including a a funded debt to ebitdar earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and rental expense ratio of less than to  b a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than to  c an annual limit on capital expenditures not including capitalized curriculum development of million  and d a minimum net worth of million 
these financial covenants remain substantially unchanged from the previously amended line of credit financial covenants 
in the event of noncompliance with these financial covenants and other defined events of default  the lender is entitled to certain remedies  including acceleration of the repayment of amounts outstanding on the revolving loan and term loan 
at august   we believe that we were in compliance with the terms and covenants applicable to our restated credit agreement 
at august   we had million drawn on the term loan and a zero balance on our revolving loan 
during fiscal  our average quarterly obligation and interest rate were as follows on the revolving loan in thousands  except interest rate 
average daily balance average month end interest rate quarter ended november  quarter ended february  quarter ended may  quarter ended august  
table of contents the decrease in the average monthly interest rate during the quarter ended may  was due to a more favorable interest rate spread obtained from the march  renewal of our revolving loan 
the effective interest rate on the term loan at august  was percent 
in addition to our million revolving loan and term loan  we have a long term lease on our corporate campus that is accounted for as a long term financing obligation 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the past three years in thousands year ended august  total cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities our cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase was primarily due to improved operating results from increased sales during fiscal compared to the prior year 
our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
cash provided by or used for changes in working capital during fiscal was primarily related to increased accounts receivable resulting from increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal and decreased accrued liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended august  we used million of net cash for investing activities 
our primary uses of cash for investing activities were the payment of the second of five potential earnout payments to the former owners of coveylink  spending on the development of certain curriculums  and the purchases of property and equipment 
during fiscal  we paid million to the former owners of coveylink based on earnings growth over the specified earnings period 
the former owners of coveylink include a son of our vice chairman of the board of directors 
in fiscal we spent million on the development of new curriculums  which was primarily used to develop our new productivity course  the choices to extraordinary productivity  which was launched in the fall of our purchases of property and equipment  which totaled million  consisted primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures at our newly relocated office in japan  computer software  computer hardware  and other leasehold improvements on certain properties 
during fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
purchases of property and equipment are expected to consist primarily of new computer hardware  software  and in other areas as deemed necessary 
however  actual capital spending is based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during the fiscal year ended august  totaled million 
our uses of cash for financing activities primarily consisted of million of net cash used to reduce our line of credit balance and million used for principal payments on our financing obligation 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds drawn from our new term loan facility  as described above  and million of cash received from participants in the employee stock purchase plan to purchase shares of our common stock 

table of contents sources of liquidity going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by the sale of goods and services to our clients on the condition that we can continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from our revolving loan  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
in order to obtain a more favorable interest rate on our credit facility  the facility requires an annual renewal 
we currently believe that we will be successful in obtaining a new or extended line of credit from our lender prior to the expiration of the current credit facility in march to ensure available liquidity in future periods 
additional potential sources of liquidity include factoring receivables  issuance of additional equity  or issuance of debt from public or private sources 
however  no assurance can be provided that we will obtain a new or extended line of credit or obtain additional financing from other sources on terms that would be acceptable to us 
if necessary  we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining a renewal or extension of our line of credit  or additional financing  we believe that cash flows from operations combined with a number of initiatives we would implement in the months preceding the due date would create sufficient liquidity to pay down the required outstanding balance on the line of credit 
these initiatives include deferral of capital purchases for externally developed curriculum and uncommitted capital expenditures  deferral of executive team compensation  deferral of certain related party contractual earnout payments  substantial reduction of associate salaries  reduction of operating expenses  including non critical travel  and deferral of payments to other vendors in order to generate sufficient cash 
considering the foregoing  we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new curriculums and technology by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  as described above  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations we have not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of lease payments resulting from the sale of our corporate campus financing obligation  payments to hp enterprise services hp for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing  and distribution services  minimum operating lease payments primarily for domestic regional and foreign office space  the repayment of our term loan obligation  which matures in fiscal  and short term purchase obligations for inventory items and other products and services used in the ordinary course of business 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands 
table of contents fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total required lease payments on corporate campus minimum required payments to hp for outsourcing services minimum operating lease payments term loan purchase obligations total expected contractual obligation payments our obligation for outsourcing services contains an annual escalation based upon changes in the employment cost index  the impact of which was not estimated in the above table 
we are also contractually allowed to collect amounts from fc organizational products that reduce the amounts shown in the table above 
the operating agreement with fc organizational products provides for reimbursement of a portion of the warehouse leasing costs  the impact of which is not included in the lease obligations in the table above 
amount includes estimated interest at percent  which was the effective rate on the term loan at august  our contractual obligations presented above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of million for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment 
for further information regarding the application of fasc  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 
other items fc organizational products is contractually obligated to pay us for rented warehouse and office space  a portion of the fixed costs for warehousing and distribution facilities  and is primarily liable for leasing costs at its retail stores 
in the event that fc organizational products is unable to pay these items  our cash flows and operating results may be adversely affected 
the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are primarily outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united 
table of contents states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic and political conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in leadership  productivity  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
products we sell books  audio media  training accessories  and other related products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
for transactions that contain more than one element  we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance for multiple element arrangements 
on september   we adopted the provisions of fasc formerly eitf  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
this guidance amends existing guidance on multiple element revenue arrangements to improve the ability of entities to recognize revenue from the sale of delivered items that are part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
one of the previous requirements was that there must be objective and reliable evidence of the standalone selling price of the undelivered items  which must be supported by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe 
the provisions of the new guidance eliminate the requirements that all undelivered elements have vsoe or tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement that is attributable to items that have already been delivered 
the residual method of allocating revenue is thereby eliminated  and we are required to allocate the arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements during the fiscal year ended august  our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate our content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell our training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
licensees are required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of their sales to clients 
we recognize royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to us from our licensees 
royalty revenue is reported as a component of training and consulting service sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation our shareholders have approved a performance based long term incentive plan ltip that provides for grants of share based performance awards to certain managerial personnel and executive management as 
table of contents directed by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
the number of common shares that are vested and issued to ltip participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of specified financial performance objectives during a defined performance period 
due to the variable number of common shares that may be issued under the ltip  we reevaluate our ltip grants on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded based upon actual and estimated financial results of the company compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are made on a cumulative basis at the adjustment date based upon the estimated probable number of common shares to be awarded 
the analysis of our ltip awards contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and judgments about the eventual number of shares that will vest in each ltip grant 
the assumptions and judgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the ltip service periods 
the evaluation of ltip performance awards and the corresponding use of estimated amounts may produce additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we record cumulative adjustments to the estimated number of common shares to be awarded under the ltip grants as described above 
during fiscal and in fiscal  we also granted share based compensation awards that have a share price  or market based  vesting conditions 
as a result  we used a monte carlo simulation to determine the fair value and expected term of these awards 
the monte carlo pricing model required the input of subjective assumptions  including items such as the expected term of the options 
if factors change  and we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense related to these awards  our share based compensation expense may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write off experience and current economic conditions and we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis 
receivable balances over days past due  which exceed a specified dollar amount  are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the probability for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the collectability of customer accounts  which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within our control  such as the financial health of each customer 
we regularly review the collectability assumptions of our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections 
adjustments to the assumptions may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  a percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at august  would decrease our reported income from operations by approximately million 
inventory valuation our inventories are primarily comprised of training materials and related accessories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are reduced to their fair market value through the use of inventory valuation reserves  which are recorded during the normal course of business 
our inventory valuation calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding a number of factors  including future inventory demand requirements and pricing strategies 
during the evaluation process we consider historical sales patterns and current sales trends  but these may not be indicative of future inventory losses 
while we have not 
table of contents made material changes to our inventory valuation methodology during the past three years  our inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand and other factors are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses that may have an adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations 
for example  a percent increase to our inventory valuation reserves at august  would decrease our reported income from operations by million 
indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life and goodwill balances are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset was generated by the merger with the covey leadership center and has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars and international licensee royalties 
our goodwill at august  was generated by the acquisition of coveylink worldwide  llc during fiscal and the subsequent payment of the first two of five contingent annual earnout payments contained in the acquisition agreement 
our impairment evaluation calculations for goodwill and the covey trade name contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  to estimate an appropriate royalty rate  and to select a discount rate that reflects the inherent risk of future cash flows 
our valuation methodology for the covey trade name has remained unchanged during the past three years 
however  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in future periods  significant impairment charges could result that would have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
the valuation methodologies for both indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are also dependent upon the share price of our common stock and our corresponding market capitalization  which may differ from estimated royalties used in our annual impairment testing 
based upon the fiscal evaluation of the covey trade name and goodwill  our trade name related revenues  licensee royalties  and overall sales levels would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair them 
however  future declines in our share price may trigger additional impairment testing and may result in impairment charges 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis  which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
our impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  forecast the useful lives of the assets  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
although we have not made any material recent changes to our long lived assets impairment assessment methodology  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents income taxes we regularly evaluate our united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
we account for certain aspects of our income tax provision using the provisions of fasc formerly fin  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon final settlement 
the provisions of fasc also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest  and penalties on income taxes  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and require increased disclosure of various income tax items 
taxes and penalties are components of our overall income tax provision 
we record previously unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements when it becomes more likely than not greater than a percent likelihood that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  we consider all available evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence may not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for audits by taxing jurisdictions  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
our unrecognized tax benefits result from uncertain tax positions about which we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of whether valuation allowances are needed on our deferred income tax assets contains uncertainties because we must project future income  including the use of tax planning strategies  by individual tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry and economic conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are necessary 
accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
the objective of asu is to simplify how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment 
these amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
previous guidance required an entity to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill step one 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in asu  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance in asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill assessments performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
we did not early adopt the provisions of this guidance and have not yet completed our assessment of the impacts on our financial statements

the market price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile 
in addition  the stock markets in general have experienced increased volatility 
factors such as quarter to quarter variations in revenues and earnings or losses and our failure to meet expectations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments we are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we may make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we may make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which may include the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal years ended august  and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expired on a quarterly basis  were recognized in current operations and were used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated statements of operations and had the following net impact on the periods indicated in thousands 
table of contents year ended august  losses on foreign exchange contracts gains on foreign exchange contracts net loss on foreign exchange contracts we did not have any derivative instruments outstanding at august  interest rate sensitivity at august   our debt obligations consisted primarily of a long term lease agreement financing obligation associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters facility  a variable rate line of credit arrangement  and a variable rate term loan that is payable in monthly installments over months 
during most of fiscal  we benefitted from extraordinarily low interest rates on our revolving loan and term loan borrowings 
our overall interest rate sensitivity is therefore primarily influenced by amounts borrowed on the revolving loan and the term loan and the prevailing interest rates on these instruments  which may create additional expense if interest rates increase in future periods 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of percent 
the term loan  on which we borrowed million  had an effective interest rate of percent at august  our revolving loan had a zero balance at august  at august  borrowing levels  a one percent increase in the interest rate on our variable rate credit obligations would increase our interest expense over the next year by approximately million 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
