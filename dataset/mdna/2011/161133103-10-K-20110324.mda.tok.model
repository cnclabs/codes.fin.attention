item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below and elsewhere in this report on form k  and in our other public filings 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks could also materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

table of contents risks related to our business and industry ongoing economic conditions have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  our business and results of operations 
consumer spending habits  including spending for our products  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salary levels  wage rates  availability of consumer credit  consumer confidence  fluctuating fuel and energy costs  and consumer perception of economic conditions 
consumer discretionary spending  including purchases of women s apparel  tends to decline during periods of high unemployment  which can have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we could be required to take additional markdowns in response to lower than anticipated levels of demand for our products  and promotional activity by our competitors could have a further adverse impact on our results of operations 
we cannot reliably predict the extent to which current or future economic conditions will affect our business 
a prolonged continuation of reduced consumer demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends  customer preferences  and other fashion related factors 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly  particularly for women apparel 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing fashion tastes and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
these risks may increase as we shift a higher proportion of our product from third party vendors and domestic sourcing to internally designed merchandise and overseas sourcing 
the increased lead times associated with overseas sourcing could increase our risk of misjudging fashion trends or styles 
if we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines  our sales will be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed sales opportunities 
in response  we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
this could also impact our reputation with our customers  which could diminish brand loyalty 
existing and increased competition in the women retail apparel and direct to consumer markets may reduce our net revenues  profits  and market share 
the women s specialty retail apparel and direct to consumer markets are highly competitive 
our competitors include individual and chain fashion specialty stores  department stores  discount stores  catalog retailers  and internet based retailers 
as a result of this competition we are required to effectively market and competitively price our products to consumers in diverse markets  and we typically experience pricing pressures  which may require us to incur increased marketing expenditures  and could lead to loss of market share 
existing and increased competition could result in reduced sales and margins  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe that the principal bases upon which we compete are merchandise style  size  selection  fit  quality  display  price  attractive website layout  efficient fulfillment of website mail orders  and personalized service to our customers  as well as store location  design  advertising  and promotion 
other women s apparel and direct to consumer companies with greater financial resources  marketing capabilities  or brand recognition may enter the plus size business and may be able to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  implement more aggressive pricing policies  introduce new products more quickly  and respond and adapt to future economic downturns more effectively 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 

table of contents our business plan is largely dependent upon continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market 
our business is primarily focused on sales of plus size women s apparel  which represents a majority of our total net sales 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by a lack of continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
our success and our ability to execute our business strategy depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and our management teams and our ability to attract  hire  and retain officers and management 
we also must motivate employees to remain focused on our strategies and goals  particularly during a period of changing executive leadership at both our corporate level and our operating division level 
if we cannot hire and retain effective management  we may be unable to compete effectively with other retailers 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
we may be unable to successfully execute on our business plans 
we cannot assure the successful execution and the realization of the benefits of our business plans  which may vary materially based on various factors 
recent additions to our management and our effort to improve our competitive position and results of operations are based on certain assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
our business plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change over time  and we may not achieve the desired results 
improving our operating margins is dependent on our ability to successfully control our operating costs 
in order to improve our operating margins we need to successfully manage our operating costs 
our inability to successfully manage labor costs  occupancy costs  transportation costs  or other operating costs  or our inability to take advantage of opportunities to reduce operating costs  could decrease our operating margins and could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our operations at a reasonable cost 
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our turnaround programs 
certain key raw materials in our products  such as cotton  wool  and synthetic fabrics  are subject to availability constraints and price volatility 
an increase in the cost or decrease in the availability of such raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and our results of operations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act and various state and federal laws and regulations governing such matters as minimum wages  exempt status classification  overtime  and employee benefits 
changes in federal or state laws or regulations regarding minimum wages  unionization  or other employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefit costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient working capital financing on terms acceptable to us 
our business requires substantial investment in our inventory for several months before sales of that inventory occur 
consequently  we require significant amounts of working capital financing 
we depend on the availability of credit to fund our working capital  including credit we receive from our bankers  our factors  our suppliers and their agents  and on our ongoing payments from our strategic alliance related to private label credit card sales 
if we or our vendors are unable to obtain sufficient financing at an affordable cost  our ability to merchandise our retail stores or e commerce businesses could be adversely affected 

table of contents we cannot assure that we will realize the expected benefits from our private label credit card programs 
we cannot assure that we will realize the expected benefits from the private label credit card operating agreements with alliance data 
a significant portion of our sales revenues is generated through our private label credit cards 
therefore  changes in the private label credit card programs that adversely impact our ability to facilitate customer credit may adversely impact our results of operations 
alliance data has discretion over certain policies and arrangements with the cardholders and may change these policies and arrangements in ways that could affect our relationship with the cardholders 
any such changes could adversely affect our private label credit card sales and our results of operations 
our ability to continue to offer private label credit card programs to our customers will depend on the success of our strategic alliance with alliance data 
credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws  including  in particular  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law on july   that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination  servicing  and enforcement of credit accounts  and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider 
alliance data may be subject to regulations to which we were not subject prior to the sale of the proprietary credit card receivables programs 
to the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our revenue streams associated with the private label credit card operating agreements  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  changes in credit card use  payment patterns  or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic  legal  social  or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty 
such changes could also negatively impact the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders or negatively impact provisions that affect our revenue streams associated with the operating agreements 
our operating results fluctuate from season to season 
our retail store and direct to consumer operations experience seasonal fluctuations in net sales and consequently in operating income  with peak sales typically occurring during the easter  labor day  and december holiday seasons for our retail stores segment and in the december holiday season for our direct to consumer segment 
in addition  extreme or unseasonable weather can affect our sales 
any decrease in net sales or margins during our peak selling periods  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months before these periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  including perishable products for our figi s food and gifts operations  before the peak selling periods 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory  especially during our peak selling periods  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of the inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our operating results are dependent in part on our ability to effectively manage our inventory levels 
we must maintain the right mix and level of inventory to operate our business successfully 
excess inventory creates pricing pressures  while insufficient inventory could lead to decreased sales and a loss of customers 
we continually evaluate the market and the mood of our customers to determine our optimal inventory levels 
if we do not correctly anticipate the demand for one or more of our products or delay placing seasonal inventory in our stores for too long  our results of operations and business could be adversely affected 

table of contents certain of our business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced 
certain of our business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties 
such processes include payroll processing  credit card authorization and processing  our e commerce platform  and certain other information technology functions 
although we make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services observe proper internal control practices and procedures  we cannot assure that failures will not occur 
the failure of such third parties to provide adequate services could adversely affect our customers shopping experience  our results of operations  liquidity  or our ability to provide adequate financial and management reporting 
we could be materially and adversely affected if any of our distribution or fulfillment centers are shut down 
we operate distribution and fulfillment centers in greencastle  indiana  white marsh  maryland  marshfield  wisconsin  stevens point  wisconsin  and neillsville  wisconsin and use a third party fulfillment center in indianapolis  indiana that services our e commerce operations 
in addition  we use third party freight consolidators and service providers in los angeles  california and north bergen  new jersey 
most of the merchandise we purchase is shipped either directly or via freight consolidators to our distribution and fulfillment centers 
if any of our distribution centers  fulfillment centers  or freight consolidators were to shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason  the other locations may not be able to adequately support the resulting additional distribution demands  in part because of capacity constraints and in part because not all brands are supported at each location 
as a result  we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores or customers during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the affected distribution center  fulfillment center  or freight consolidator 
should the third party fulfillment center that services our e commerce operations cease providing fulfillment services the resultant failure to deliver e commerce orders promptly could adversely affect our e commerce operations and our results of operations 
natural disasters  war  acts of terrorism  or other armed conflict may negatively impact the availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
the occurrence of  or threat of  a natural disaster  war  acts of terrorism  or other armed conflict on the united states or international economies could negatively affect our ability to obtain merchandise for sale 
a significant portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our net sales and profit margins may be adversely impacted 
if commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers  fulfillment centers  freight consolidators  stores  or our direct to consumer customers 
as a result of the occurrence of  or threat of  a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the united states we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our inability to successfully manage customer service or fulfillment for our e commerce websites could adversely impact our results of operations 
successful operation of our e commerce websites and our catalog business is dependent on our ability to maintain efficient and uninterrupted customer service and fulfillment operations 
inadequate systems capacity  a disruption or slowdown in telecommunications services  changes in technology  changes in government regulations  systems issues  security breaches  or customer privacy issues could result in reduced sales or increases in operating expenses as a result of our efforts or our inability to remedy such issues 

table of contents we rely on foreign sources of production 
we purchase a significant portion of our apparel directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
we face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad 
such risks include but are not necessarily limited to political instability  increased security requirements applicable to imported goods  trade restrictions  imposition of or changes in duties  quotas  taxes  and other charges on imports  currency and exchange risks  issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards  inability of our vendors to manufacture or deliver merchandise in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards  increased lead times  delays in shipping  or increased costs of transportation 
new governmental requirements could be proposed that would have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and could include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that  if enacted  could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries 
our purchasing patterns are dictated by our seasonal inventory requirements 
we typically enter into purchase commitments with our vendors for seasonal inventories up to six months ahead of when we take delivery of those products 
all of our purchase commitments with foreign vendors are denominated in us dollars and are settled in us dollars 
these arrangements provide a natural hedge to the impacts of changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies during the period from when we enter into purchase commitments with our vendors to when we take delivery of the products in the countries from which we source our products 
however  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies can impact the negotiated pricing for products when comparing one seasonal buying period to another 
we have a network of countries and vendors from which we can source  but a weakening of the us dollar in relation to those foreign currencies could increase the cost of our foreign sourced products 
the future performance of our business depends on our foreign suppliers and may be adversely affected by the factors listed above  which are beyond our control 
issues of global workplace conditions may adversely affect our business 
if any one of our manufacturers or vendors fails to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  is perceived by the public as failing to meet certain united states labor standards  or employs unfair labor practices  our business could be adversely affected 
current global workplace concerns of the public include wages  working conditions  age of employees  and various other employment standards 
these globalization issues may affect the available supply of certain manufacturers products  which may result in increased costs to us 
furthermore  a negative customer perception of any of our key vendors or their products may result in a lower customer demand for our apparel 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
our trademarks and servicemarks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and servicemarks on a worldwide basis 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and servicemarks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks  servicemarks  or proprietary rights 
other retailers have been subject to unauthorized imitation  and imitation of our names  concepts  store designs  or merchandise in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may be subject to litigation and other regulatory proceedings that may negatively impact our results of operations 
from time to time  we are subject to litigation and regulatory actions relating to our business 
we may also become subject to litigation trends  such as class action suits brought under various consumer protection and employment laws or resulting from sales or acquisitions of business operations 
the initiation or defense of litigation or regulatory actions requires us to make certain expenditures and can divert the attention of our management away from operating our business 
in addition  an unfavorable decision or outcome could result in further  potentially significant  expenditures 
see item legal proceedings below for a discussion of current legal proceedings we are involved with 
we depend on strip shopping center and mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations for our retail stores segment 
our long term growth plan for our retail stores segment depends on our ability to open and profitably operate new retail stores  to convert  where applicable  the formats of existing stores on a profitable basis  and to continue to expand our outlet distribution channel 
in addition  we will need to identify  hire  and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to work in our stores 
our sales are dependent in part on a high volume of strip shopping center and mall traffic 
strip shopping center and mall traffic may be adversely affected by  among other things  economic downturns  the closing of anchor stores  or changes in customer shopping preferences 
a decline in the popularity of strip shopping center or mall shopping among our target customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations 
we cannot assure that desirable store locations will continue to be available 
in addition  the timely opening of new store locations could be adversely affected by delays in obtaining necessary permits and approvals  lack of availability of construction materials and labor  or work stoppages 
our ability to acquire or maintain desirable store locations could be adversely affected by financial difficulties encountered by strip shopping center or mall landlords or by competition with other retailers for prime locations 

table of contents acquisition of additional store locations and our ability to profitably operate existing store locations are dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate lease terms for such locations 
our ability to operate successfully is dependent upon our ability to develop and maintain good relationships with our landlords 
consolidation in the commercial retail real estate industry could limit our future ability to negotiate favorable rental terms for new or existing store locations or to close under performing stores on favorable terms 
should a significant consolidation occur  a large proportion of our store base could be concentrated with one or a few entities that could then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to us due to the significant leverage they would possess 
if we are unable to negotiate favorable rental terms with these entities and are therefore unable to profitably operate our existing stores  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may acquire or divest businesses or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances  which may materially affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses and may decide to buy or sell businesses or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances 
significant acquisitions and alliances may increase demands on management by diverting their attention away from running our core business  as well as on financial resources  information systems  and internal control systems 
our success with respect to acquisitions and alliances will depend  in part  on our ability to manage and integrate acquired businesses and alliances with our existing businesses and to successfully implement  improve  and expand our systems  procedures  and controls 
in addition  we may divest existing businesses  which would cause a decline in revenues and may cause our financial results to be more volatile 
a divestiture could also negatively affect the price of our common stock and could increase our reliance on growth in our remaining core business operations 
if we fail to integrate and manage acquired businesses successfully or to manage the risks associated with divestitures  joint ventures  or other alliances  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
other risks anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a change in control  such as provisions that do not permit cumulative voting  permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval  require certain advance notice procedures with regard to the nomination of candidates for election as directors  other than nominations by or at the direction of our board  prevent our directors from being removed without cause except upon super majority shareholder approval  and prevent a holder of or more of our common stock from taking certain actions without certain approvals 

table of contents failure to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are required to include our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on whether or not they believe that we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a possible loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
such a failure could result in our inability to provide timely and or reliable financial information and could adversely affect our business 
we could be required to repurchase our senior convertible notes due may  for cash prior to maturity of the notes 
the holders of the outstanding principal amount of our senior convertible notes due may  the notes could require us to repurchase the principal amount of the notes for cash before maturity upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the prospectus filed in connection with the notes see
