item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
this information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  reflect all recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present our financial information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
quarterly consolidated statements of operations unaudited the tables below sets forth selected unaudited financial data for each quarter for the last two fiscal years in thousands  except for per share amounts

we acquired hypercom corporation on august  for million and its results of operations are included from the date of acquisition 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of transaction and integration costs related to our acquisitions in fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reduced our accrual related to claims against our brazilian subsidiary which was acquired by us due to our acquisition of lipman by million million brazilian reais as the statute of limitations expired on certain tax contingencies 
of this amount  million which represent accrued penalties was reflected as other income expense  net  and million which consisted of accrued interest related to the claims was reversed against interest expense 
we reduced our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulting in a tax benefit of million because there was sufficient positive evidence of our ability to generate sufficient us and foreign income in future fiscal years to recognize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the us 
table of contents first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year ended october  net revenues system solutions services total net revenues cost of net revenues system solutions services total cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income basic net income per share diluted net income per share we reduced our accrual related to claims against our brazilian subsidiary prior to our acquisition of that subsidiary from lipman by million million brazilian reais as a result of a settlement of disputed payables and expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax contingencies 
of this amount  million was reflected as other income expense  net  and million which consisted of accrued interest related to the claim was reversed against interest expense 
in addition  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter ended october  primarily due to a worthless stock deduction 
we determined that one of our uk subsidiaries was insolvent on a fair market value basis and that it became worthless during the year resulting in a worthless stock deduction of million for tax purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in fiscal year interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our borrowings under the credit facility we entered into on october  these borrowings generally bear interest based upon the one or three month libor rate 
as of october   a basis point increase in interest rates on our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
we generally invest most of our cash in overnight and short term instruments  which would earn more interest income if market interest rates rise and less interest income if market interest rates fall 

table of contents foreign currency transaction risk a majority of our sales are made to customers outside the united states 
a substantial portion of the net revenues we generate from such sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our cost of net revenues and operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and are denominated in local currencies 
for consolidated reporting  revenue and expenses denominated in non us currencies are translated to non us dollars at average currency exchange rates for the period p l exposures 
thus  even if foreign operations results were stable  fluctuating currency rates may produce volatile reported results 
we have made limited efforts to mitigate p l exposures by hedging with currency derivatives 
as of october  and  we have no foreign exchange forward contracts designated as a cash flow hedge pursuant to accounting standard codification derivatives and hedging 
we may in the future use foreign exchange forward or option contracts to hedge p l exposures  depending upon the risks of the exposures  the costs of hedging  and other considerations 
however  hedges of p l exposures will only mitigate a portion of our risk and only for a short period 
we will remain subject to the currency risk of p l exposures 
the balance sheets of our us and international businesses have monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of such business balance sheet exposures  such as canadian dollar receivables held by our us business  or us dollar payables of our uk business 
as exchange rates fluctuate  balance sheet exposures generate foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which are included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
most balance sheet exposures will settle in cash or convert from a foreign currency to a local currency in the foreseeable future  at which time the impact of rate fluctuations will be realized and we will receive or dispense more or less cash than the value originally recorded 
such exposures are termed near term balance sheet exposures 
some balance sheet exposures may not be settled in the foreseeable future in management estimation and thus the cash impact of their currency gains or losses is not expected to be felt in the foreseeable future 
we have in the past run and expect to continue to run a hedging program to mitigate the risk of near term balance sheet exposures by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts 
therefore  the hedging program objective is to have gains or losses of the foreign exchange forward contracts largely offset the losses or gains of the near term balance sheet exposures 
the unrealized gains of foreign exchange forward contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets  the unrealized losses are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis with gains and losses included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
in some instances  we seek to hedge transactions that are expected to become near term balance sheet exposures in the very short term  generally within one month 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of october  are presented in the table below 
all forward contracts are representative of the expected payments to be made under these instruments 
the fair market value of the contracts represents the difference between the spot currency rate at october  and the contracted rate 
all of these forward contracts mature within days of october  in thousands currency local currency contract amount currency contracted amount fair market value at october  contracts to buy usd argentine peso ars usd canadian dollar cad usd chinese yuan cny usd euro eur usd british pound gbp usd indian rupee inr usd korean won krw usd mexican peso mxn usd polish zloty pln usd sa rand zar usd 
table of contents as of october   our balance sheet exposures amounted to million and were partially offset by forward contracts with a notional amount of million 
based on our net exposures as of october   a movement in currency rates would result in a gain or loss of million 
as of october   our near term balance sheet exposures  which represent the balance sheet exposures less an israeli shekel payable equivalent to million that we do not expect to be settled in the near term  amounted to million and  thus a movement in currency rates would result in a gain or loss of million that we would expect to be realized in the foreseeable future 
hedging of our balance sheet exposures may not always be effective to protect us against currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of non us denominated assets and liabilities 
in addition  at times we have not fully hedged our balance sheet exposures  leaving us at risk to foreign exchange gains and losses on the un hedged amounts 
furthermore  historically we have not hedged our p l exposures 
accordingly  if there were an adverse movement in exchange rates  we might suffer significant losses 
for instance  for the fiscal years ended october   and  we recorded million  million and million in net foreign exchange losses  respectively  despite our hedging activities 
equity price risk in june  we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due june the notes which may be converted prior to maturity into cash and shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events 
in april  we repurchased and extinguished million par value of our outstanding notes 
in december  we repurchased and extinguished an additional million par value of our outstanding notes 
as of october   the remaining par value of the notes was million 
the conversion price of the notes at issuance was approximately per share 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock  up to the principal amount of the notes 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  would be paid in our common stock 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we entered into note hedge transactions with lehman brothers otc derivatives lehman derivatives and jp morgan chase bank national association  london branch that serve to reduce the financial impact from the conversion of the notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock  as well as to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the outstanding notes in the event that the volume weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day of the relevant conversion period or other relevant valuation period for the notes is greater than 
we also sold warrants to the same counterparties allowing them to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately per share in equal share amounts on each trading day from december  to february  the filing by lehman brothers of a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition in september constituted an event of default under the note hedge transactions with lehman derivatives and the related guaranty by lehman brothers  giving us the immediate right to terminate the note hedge transaction with them and entitling us to claim reimbursement for the loss incurred in terminating and closing out the transaction 
in june  we reached a settlement with lehman derivatives whereby we agreed to a cancel the note hedge with them and b consent to the assignment of warrants held by them to a third party in return for an allocated unsubordinated non priority general unsecured claim against lehman derivatives in the amount of million 
subsequently  in july we sold this claim without recourse for million  and thus reflected a million realized gain on the sale of this claim  in other income expenses  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  as of october   we held the remaining note hedge transactions that reduce by one half of the potential dilution upon conversion of the outstanding notes in the event that the volume weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day of the relevant conversion period or other relevant valuation period for the notes is greater than 
there is no impact if the share price of our common stock is below upon conversion of the notes 
for every that the share price of our common stock exceeds  we expect to issue the equivalent of million worth of shares of our common stock if all of the notes are converted after taking into account the benefit of our remaining note hedge transactions 
because of the outstanding warrants to purchase approximately million of our shares of common stock at approximately per share  for every that the share price of our common stock exceeds in each of the trading days from december  to february   we will be required to issue the equivalent of million worth of shares of our common stock 
information on the share price of our common stock may be found under part ii item market for registrant common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in this annual report on form k
