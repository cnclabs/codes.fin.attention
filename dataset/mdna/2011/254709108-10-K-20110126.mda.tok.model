our fiscal year ends on november of each year 
our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers  merchants and issuers 
the primary costs required to operate our business include funding costs interest expense  loan loss provisions  customer rewards  and expenses incurred to grow  manage and service our loan receivables and networks 
our business activities are funded primarily through the raising of consumer deposits  securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of both secured and unsecured debt 
change in accounting principle related to off balance sheet securitizations beginning with the first quarter  we have included the trusts used in our securitization activities in our consolidated financial results in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement no 
codified under the fasb accounting standards codification asc section  transfers and servicing and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to fasb interpretations no 
r statement no 
codified under asc section  consolidation  which were effective for us on december   the beginning of our fiscal year 
under statement no 
 the trusts used in our securitization transactions are no longer exempt from consolidation 
statement no 
prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on our financial statements 
based on our assessment  we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent the trusts and accordingly  we began consolidating the trusts on december  using the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by statement no 
 we recorded a billion increase in total assets  a billion increase in total liabilities and a billion decrease in stockholders equity comprised of a billion decrease in retained earnings offset by an increase of billion in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the significant adjustments to our statement of financial condition upon adoption of statements no 
and are outlined below consolidation of billion of securitized loan receivables and the related debt issued from the trusts to third party investors  
table of contents reclassification of billion of certificated retained interests classified as investment securities to loan receivables  recording of a billion allowance for loan losses  not previously required under gaap  for the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables  derecognition of the remaining billion value of the interest only strip receivable  net of tax  recorded in amounts due from asset securitization and reclassification of the remaining billion of amounts due from asset securitization to restricted cash  loan receivables and other assets  and recording of net deferred tax assets of billion  largely related to establishing an allowance for loan losses on the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables 
beginning with the first quarter  our results of operations no longer reflect securitization income  but instead report interest income  net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt 
additionally  we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
also  there are no gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing 
because our securitization transactions are being accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities 
notwithstanding this accounting treatment  our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables from discover bank  and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts  even in insolvency  receivership or conservatorship proceedings 
we do  however  continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in the assets of these trusts 
reconciliations of gaap to as adjusted data we did not retrospectively adopt statements no 
and and  therefore  the consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report as of and for the year ended november  reflect the new accounting requirements  but the historical statement of financial condition as of november  and statements of income and statements of cash flows for the years ended november  and continue to reflect the accounting applicable prior to the adoption of the new accounting requirements 
to enable the reader to better understand our financial information by reflecting period over period data on a consistent basis  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presents our financial information as of and for the year ended november  as compared to adjusted results of operations data for the years ended november  and  and  where necessary  we have also provided certain information as of and for the year ended november  and on an as adjusted basis 
management believes the adjusted financial information is useful to investors as it aligns with the financial information used in its decision making process and in evaluating the business 
the as adjusted amounts show how our financial data would have been presented if the trusts used in our securitization activities were consolidated into our financial statements for such historical periods  remove the impact of income received in connection with the settlement of our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard during the years ended november  and  and exclude the interest charge related to our dispute with morgan stanley regarding the special dividend agreement  which  among other things  specified how proceeds of the antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard were to be shared 
the impacts of statements no 
and on our earnings summary  detail of other income and direct banking segment information are reflected in two steps in the reconciliations of gaap to as adjusted data in the tables below 
first  we made securitization adjustments to reverse the effect of loan securitization by recharacterizing securitization income to report interest income  expense  provision for loan losses  discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income in the same line items as non securitized loans 
these adjustments result in a managed basis presentation  which we have historically included in our quarterly and annual reports to reflect the way in which our senior management evaluated our business performance and allocated resources 

table of contents then  additional adjustments were made to reflect results as if the trusts used in our securitization activities had been fully consolidated in our historical results 
these adjustments include elimination of interest income and interest expense related to certificated retained interests classified as investment securities and associated intercompany debt  an adjustment to the provision for loan losses for the change in securitized loan receivables  elimination of the revaluation gains or losses associated with the interest only strip receivable  which was derecognized upon adoption  and an adjustment to reflect the income tax effects related to these adjustments 
the impacts of statements no 
and on our effective tax rate  loan receivables and average balance sheet information and certain other selected financial data are reflected in one step  rather than two  in the reconciliations of gaap to as adjusted data set forth in the tables below as there is no meaningful difference between such information on a historical managed basis as compared to on an as adjusted basis

table of contents highlights net income in was million as compared to a reported net income of billion in which included billion of after tax income from the settlement of our antitrust litigation and an as adjusted net loss of million in after peaking in the first quarter  net charge offs declined throughout the remainder of our over day delinquencies declined throughout after peaking in the fourth quarter of at november   the twelve month outlook for credit had improved in comparison to the outlook at the end of resulting in a decline in the loan loss reserve rate  which led to a million reduction of our allowance for loan losses in discover card sales volume increased in as compared to  due to higher average spend per customer and broadened merchant acceptance 
however  credit card loan receivables at november  were down  to billion  from november  as adjusted due to a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate 
our revenues were unfavorably impacted in by the implementation of card act provisions  which included limitations on our ability to reprice accounts  the elimination of overlimit fees and a reduction in the amount of standard late fees 
we made significant investments to strengthen the discover brand in  reflected in a increase in marketing and business development expenses as compared to transaction dollar volume in our payment services segment was billion in  an increase of as compared to  and the number of transactions processed on our pulse network increased during the same period 
pretax income for the segment was million in  an increase of from  reflecting increased volumes from new and existing clients  higher margins from transactions processed on our pulse network and lower operating expenses 
direct to consumer deposits grew to billion at november   an increase of billion as compared to november  this increase included the acquisition of approximately billion of deposits in the second quarter our total equity at november  was billion lower than it was at november   although our regulatory capital ratios continued to remain strong 
the reduction in equity reflects a billion reduction related to our adoption of fasb statements no 
and and a billion reduction related to our redemption of our preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock that we previously issued to the us treasury under the capital purchase program 
these reductions were partially offset by the addition of million of net income 
and highlights in  we settled our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard for billion 
we received million from mastercard million after tax in the fourth quarter for its portion of the settlement 
throughout  we received a total of billion billion after tax from visa for its portion of the settlement 
at the time of our spin off  we entered into an agreement with morgan stanley to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared  among other things 
in  we paid morgan stanley a dividend of million under an amendment to that agreement 
for additional details  see note litigation to our consolidated financial statements 
we acquired diners club international diners club for million in june diners club has network licensees  which are generally financial institutions  that issue diners club branded credit cards and or provide card acceptance services in over countries and territories 
we sold our united kingdom credit card business goldfish in march this business represented substantially all of our international card segment  which is presented in discontinued operations in this report 

table of contents outlook credit performance improved throughout and we believe delinquencies and net charge offs will continue to improve in as compared to levels 
we expect this improvement to result in further reductions of our loan loss reserves 
in  we expect the continued impact of the implementation of card act provisions along with an anticipated increase in the volume of promotional rate offers to unfavorably impact credit card yield  although we believe it will be partially offset by continued improvement in interest charge offs 
the decline in credit card yield  together with the addition of lower rate student loans from the acquisition of the student loan corporation  discussed further below  will lead to a reduction in our net interest margin 
we believe that the significant investments we made in marketing and advertising in will continue to benefit discover card sales volumes in this along with an expected increase in the volume of promotional rate offers may result in a modest increase in the level of credit card loan receivables 
at november   we had billion in our liquidity investment portfolio 
maturities of deposit and securitization obligations leveled off in the second half of and we expect maturities will be relatively stable by comparison 
in  the level of our liquidity investment portfolio will fluctuate primarily due to asset requirements  maturity obligations and deposit cash flows 
with respect to new funding  we expect to continue to grow direct to consumer deposits in and take advantage of opportunities to issue asset backed securities when we believe market conditions are favorable 
we experienced strong growth in volumes in our payments business in  which we expect to continue in our investment in building brand awareness and global acceptance is expected to grow in compared to levels 
we believe that our strategic network alliances with key card networks such as korea s bc card  japan s jcb  china unionpay and serbia s dinacard  along with the continued development of merchant acquirer relationships  will be our foundation for driving global acceptance and volumes 
recent developments on december   we acquired the student loan corporation slc in a merger transaction for million 
we received a purchase price closing adjustment in the form of a cash payment of approximately million from citibank  na citibank  the owner of slc before the merger  resulting in a net cash outlay of approximately million for the acquisition of slc 
in the transaction  we acquired slc s ongoing private student loan business and approximately billion of private student loans and other assets  along with assuming approximately billion of slc s existing asset backed securitization debt funding and other liabilities 
we acquired the loans and other assets at an discount  which will be applied to the balance sheet items through purchase accounting entries 
slc is now a wholly owned subsidiary of discover bank 
the acquisition significantly increased the size of our private student loan portfolio  which was billion at november  in addition  the acquisition has provided us with a developed student loan business platform  additional school relationships  experienced personnel and slc s website 
legislative and regulatory developments financial regulatory reform in july  the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the reform act  which contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets 
the reform act  as well as other legislative and regulatory changes  could have a significant impact on us by  for example  requiring us to change our business practices  requiring us to meet more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements  limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities  imposing additional costs on us  limiting fees we can charge for services  impacting the value of our assets  or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses 
the reform act addresses risks to the economy and the payments system  especially those posed by large systemically significant financial firms  including bank holding companies with assets of at least billion  which would include us 
it 
table of contents does so through a variety of measures  including increased capital and liquidity requirements  limits on leverage  enhanced supervisory authority including authority to limit activities and growth  regulatory oversight of non banking entities  broad new powers to seize and wind down failed systemically important financial firms  including non bank financial companies and the establishment of a mechanism to recover such costs through assessments on large financial firms  enhanced regulation of derivatives  restrictions on and additional disclosure of executive compensation  additional corporate governance requirements  and oversight of credit rating agencies 
effective july  the reform act requires a bank holding company that elects treatment as a financial holding company  such as us  to be both well capitalized and well managed in addition to the existing requirement that a financial holding company s subsidiary banks be well capitalized and well managed 
additionally  the reform act established the bureau of consumer financial protection the bcfp within the federal reserve  which will regulate consumer financial products and services 
on july   many consumer financial protection functions currently assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies will shift to the bcfp 
the bcfp will have broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit  savings and payment services and products 
the bcfp will be directed to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive practices and ensure that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services  and that such markets are fair  transparent and competitive 
the bcfp will have rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws and broad supervisory  examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services  such as us 
state officials will be authorized to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the bcfp 
for more information regarding the bcfp and how it may affect us  see risk factors 
in addition  the reform act requires  effective july   that interchange fees paid to or charged by payment card issuers on debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the issuer s cost in connection with such transactions 
the reform act directs the federal reserve to enact rules to implement this requirement and to prohibit debit card networks and issuers from requiring debit card transactions to be processed solely on a single payment network or two or more affiliated networks 
further  the reform act prohibits credit debit network rules that restrict merchants from offering discounts to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment  or from setting minimum transaction amounts of or less for use of credit cards  as long as such merchant practices do not differentiate on the basis of the issuer or network 
the impact of these provisions on the debit card market and the pulse network will depend upon federal reserve implementing regulations  the actions of our competitors  and the behavior of other marketplace participants 
the federal reserve issued proposed regulations in december  and we are currently evaluating the proposal 
the provisions applicable to the debit card market may adversely affect pulse s business practices  network transaction volume  revenue  and prospects for future growth 
for more information regarding the potential impact of these provisions on us  see risk factors 
in addition  the reform act contains several provisions that could increase the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic deposit insurance premiums paid by discover bank 
see fdic initiatives regarding assessments below for more information 
various other assessments and fees are also authorized in the legislation and others could be authorized in the future 
as described below under asset backed securities regulations  the reform act also imposes a number of significant changes relating to the asset backed securities and structured finance markets  which may impact our ability and or desire to utilize those markets to meet funding and liquidity needs 
many provisions of the reform act require the adoption of rules to implement 
in addition  the reform act mandates multiple studies  which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
the effect of the reform act and its implementing regulations on our business and operations could be significant 
in addition  we may be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the reform act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it 
the reform act  any related legislation and any implementing regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents legislation addressing credit card practices in may  the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act was enacted 
the card act made numerous changes to the truth in lending act  affecting the marketing  underwriting  pricing  billing and other aspects of the consumer credit card business 
several provisions of the card act became effective in august  but most of the requirements became effective in february and others became effective in august certain provisions of the card act have required us to make fundamental changes to our business practices and systems 
we have made modifications to products  pricing  marketing strategies and other business practices designed to be in compliance with the law  to be attractive to consumers and to provide a good return for our stockholders 
certain card act requirements  however  have reduced and will continue to reduce our interest income and loan fee income 
see risk factors for more information 
the long term impact of the card act ultimately depends upon consumer behavior and the actions of our competitors  in addition to further federal reserve and bcfp interpretation of the provisions 
the card act also requires the federal reserve and the government accountability office to conduct various studies  including a review of interchange fees  reasons for credit limit reductions and rate increases  small business cards  and credit card terms and disclosures 
based on the results of these studies  new requirements that negatively impact us may be introduced as future legislation or regulation 
asset backed securities regulations while we have capacity to issue new asset backed securities from our credit card securitization trusts  there has been uncertainty in the securitization market as a result of revised accounting standards and related guidance from the fdic as well as proposed new securities and exchange commission sec rules governing the issuance of asset backed securities and additional requirements contained in the reform act 
fdic rule the ability of issuers of asset backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has been based  in part  on the fdic s safe harbor rule entitled treatment by the federal deposit insurance corporation as conservator or receiver of financial assets transferred by an insured depository institution in connection with a securitization or participation  which provides that the fdic  as conservator or receiver  will not  using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts  seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization  or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution  provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under gaap 
pursuant to fasb guidance for transfers of financial assets  effective for us on december   certain transfers of assets to special purpose entities including discover bank s transfer of assets to the discover card master trust no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment 
in march  the fdic published a transitional rule that preserved the safe harbor treatment applicable under the original fdic safe harbor rule for beneficial interests in securitizations of revolving assets issued on or prior to september  so long as those securitizations would have complied with the original safe harbor under gaap in effect prior to november  on september   the fdic approved a final rule that preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts that issued any securities on or prior to september   which includes the trusts used in our credit card securitization program 
other legislative and regulatory developments  namely the proposed sec regulation ab ii  the securitization and rating agency provisions of the reform act and the federal banking agencies notice regarding their consideration of replacement of the ratings based approach for assessing capital charges against securitization exposures  may  however  impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 
see below for additional information 
sec regulation ab ii in april  the sec proposed revised rules for asset backed securities offerings sec regulation ab ii that  if adopted  would substantially change the disclosure  reporting and offering process for public and private offerings of asset backed securities  including those offered under our credit card securitization program 
the proposed rules  if adopted in their current form  would  among other things  impose as a condition for the shelf registration of asset backed securities a requirement that the sponsor of the asset backed securities offering hold a minimum of of the nominal amount of each of the tranches sold or transferred to investors or  in the case of revolving master trusts  an originator s interest of a minimum of of the nominal amount of the securitization exposures and not hedge those holdings 
issuers 
table of contents of publicly offered asset backed securities would be required to disclose more information regarding the underlying assets and to file a computer program that demonstrates the effect of the transaction s waterfall of distributions 
in addition  the proposals would alter the safe harbor standards for the private placement of asset backed securities to impose informational requirements similar to those that would apply to registered public offerings of such securities 
reform act the reform act also imposes a number of significant changes relating to the asset backed securities and structured finance markets  including a requirement that regulators jointly adopt regulations requiring the sponsor of a securitization to retain  subject to certain exemptions and exceptions  at least unhedged credit risk on securitized exposures 
the reform act also requires the sec to impose asset level registration statement disclosure requirements if the data is necessary for investors to independently perform due diligence 
additionally  the reform act nullified rule g of the securities act of the securities act effective immediately  which had provided that credit ratings assigned by a rating agency would not be considered part of a registration statement prepared or certified by an expert 
this change requires registrants including issuers of asset backed securities to obtain written consent of a credit rating agency in order to include the agency s rating in a registration statement and subjects the rating agencies to expert liability under section of the securities act for misstatements or omissions of materials facts in connection with such credit rating disclosure 
in response to this measure  the major credit rating agencies issued statements indicating that they would be unwilling to provide the required consent 
in order to provide a transition period  the sec subsequently issued a no action letter in july allowing issuers of asset backed securities to omit credit ratings from registration statements until january  in november  the sec issued a second letter extending this no action period indefinitely 
failure to ultimately resolve this issue could impact our ability to offer registered asset backed securities 
section a of the reform act requires each federal agency to review and to remove references to external credit ratings from their regulations that require the use of an assessment of creditworthiness of a security  and to substitute in their place other standards of creditworthiness that the agencies determine to be appropriate for such regulations 
in response to such requirement  in august  the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting comment on alternatives to the use of credit ratings in their risk based capital rules for banking organizations  including alternatives to the ratings based approach in such rules for securitization exposures 
it is not clear what alternatives will ultimately be adopted 
any such alternatives could  among other things  significantly affect the amount of capital that banking organizations are required to keep against such exposures 
it is uncertain at this time what the rules implementing the provisions of the reform act related to asset backed securities will ultimately look like and what impact they will have on our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 
for instance  with respect to risk retention  we currently hold the seller s interest in our securitization trusts as well as certain subordinated tranches issued by these trusts  which collectively represent approximately of the principal receivables balance in our trusts as of november  although we believe it likely that any final regulations implementing the reform act risk retention requirements  which must be adopted on an interagency basis  will recognize these interests as satisfying the risk retention requirement  we will not have certainty until the proposed rules have been promulgated 
the sec recently published a timetable for the release of its rules implementing the provisions of the reform act including those impacting the issuance of asset backed securities  which are scheduled to be released by july however  the sec has provided no timetable for implementing the disclosure changes in proposed sec regulation ab ii  as the reform act does not mandate the timing for adoption of those changes 
student loan legislation the health care and education reconciliation act of hcera requires all federal student loans originated after july to be made directly by the federal government  rather than by private institutions through the federal family education loan program 
because hcera allows financial institutions to continue offering private student loans  we do not currently expect it to have a significant impact on our private student loan program 
the reform act referenced above provides for a study of private education loans and lenders and creates a private education loan ombudsman within the bcfp 
the study could lead to additional legislation or regulation in the future 
in addition  legislation has been introduced in congress that would make it substantially easier for borrowers to discharge private student loans in bankruptcy  as described further below  and could be reintroduced in the next congress 

table of contents bankruptcy legislation a bill referred to the senate judiciary committee in the previous congress would disallow claims in chapter bankruptcy based on high cost consumer debt and exclude consumers with such debt from the bankruptcy means test 
the means test requires debtors who can afford to repay a portion of their debts through chapter repayment plan do so  rather than discharge all indebtedness under chapter the proposed legislation  if enacted  could increase the percentage of bankruptcy filers who obtain full debt discharges to the detriment of all unsecured lenders  and could result in increased charge offs of our loan receivables 
it is unclear whether this legislation will be considered by the next congress 
congress has also considered legislation to allow bankruptcy courts to restructure first mortgage loans eg  by reducing the loan amount to the value of the collateral  a process referred to as cramdown 
such a change would likely increase the number of individuals who file for bankruptcy  which would adversely impact all creditors including us 
while the house of representatives approved a cramdown bill  the senate did not 
this or similar legislation could be reintroduced in the next congress 
in addition  a congressional subcommittee in the previous congress approved a bill that would remove current limitations on the dischargeability of private student loan debts in bankruptcy 
if enacted  the bill would make it substantially easier for borrowers of private student loans to obtain a discharge of their student loan debts 
this bill could be reintroduced in the next congress 
if such legislation were to be enacted into law  it could substantially increase the credit losses of our private student loan business 
compensation developments in june  the federal reserve  together with the fdic and the other banking agencies  issued final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation practices of financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safety and soundness 
the federal reserve recently conducted a special horizontal review of compensation practices at more than twenty large complex banking organizations  including us  with the expectation that incentive compensation practices appropriately balance risk and financial results and avoid creating incentives for employees to take imprudent risks 
the reform act described above under financial regulatory reform imposes additional disclosures and restrictions on compensation 
fdic initiatives regarding assessments the reform act contains several provisions that could increase the fdic deposit insurance premiums paid by discover bank 
one provision includes a change in the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of total deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity 
another provision includes an increase in the minimum reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from to of insured deposits with the fdic having until september  to meet the new minimum through assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of billion or more while also removing the cap on the size of the fund 
as required by the reform act  in october  the fdic announced its plan to increase the required reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to by september  utilizing new rate schedules 
this was followed by two proposals issued by the fdic in november in its first proposal  the fdic proposed to implement the provision of the reform act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on insured deposits to one based on average consolidated assets less tangible equity and change the assessment rate schedules so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as under the rate schedules proposed by the fdic in october the second fdic proposal would revise the risk based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions generally  those with at least billion in total assets 
any future increases in assessments would decrease our earnings and could adversely affect our results of operations 
international initiatives related to capital and liquidity the basel committee on banking supervision released two consultative documents proposing significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements in december  commonly referred to as basel iii 
the basel committee considered public comments received on the december proposal  the results of a qualitative impact study and the economic impact over the transition period 
in july  the committee issued statements that reflected  among other things  decisions reached on certain elements of the comprehensive proposals  including the overall design of the capital and liquidity reform package 

table of contents in september  the group of governors and heads of supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  announced minimum capital ratios and transition periods and endorsed the statements the committee released in july following endorsement of the basel iii reform package by the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors g in november  in december the basel committee released the basel iii rules text 
basel iii provides that i the minimum requirement for the tier common equity ratio will be increased from the current level to  to be phased in by january   and ii the minimum requirement for the tier capital ratio will be increased from to  to be phased in by january  the tier common equity ratio will be calculated after applying certain regulatory deductions  including for deferred tax assets above prescribed limitations that arise from timing differences 
in addition  basel iii includes a capital conservation buffer that requires banking organizations to maintain an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets on top of the minimum requirement  which will be phased in between january  and january  the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress and  while banks are allowed to draw on the buffer during periods of stress  if a bank s regulatory capital ratios approach the minimum requirement  the bank will be subject to constraints on earnings distributions 
in addition  basel iii includes a countercyclical buffer within a range of  which would be implemented according to a particular nation s circumstances 
these capital requirements are supplemented under basel iii by a non risk based leverage ratio 
a minimum tier leverage ratio of will be tested during the parallel run period starting january  based on the results of the parallel run period  any final adjustments would be carried out in the first half of basel iii states that systemically important banks should have higher loss absorbing capacity than required by the basel iii standards 
the committee will complete a study of the magnitude of additional loss absorbency that global systemically important banks should have by mid basel iii also reaffirms the basel committee s intention to introduce higher capital requirements on securitization and trading activities at the end of the basel iii liquidity proposals have three main elements i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality assets sufficient to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon  and iii a set of monitoring tools that the basel committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors 
after an observation period beginning in  the liquidity coverage ratio will become effective on january  the revised net stable funding ratio will become effective january  implementation of basel iii in the us will require implementing regulations and guidelines by us banking regulators  which may differ in significant ways from the recommendations published by the basel committee 
it is unclear how us banking regulators will define well capitalized in their implementation of basel iii 
the reform act also includes provisions related to increased capital and liquidity requirements 
such provisions would establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for all depository institution holding companies and insured depository institutions that cannot be less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment of the reform act ie  july  
we are not able to predict at this time the precise content of capital and liquidity guidelines or regulations that may be adopted by regulatory agencies having authority over us and our subsidiaries or the impact that any changes in regulation would have on us 
however  we expect that the new standards will generally require us or our banking subsidiaries to maintain more capital  with common equity as a more predominant component  or manage the configuration of our assets and liabilities in order to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements  which could significantly impact our return on equity  financial condition  operations  capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities

direct banking for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  our direct banking segment had pretax income of billion for the year ended november  as compared to a reported pretax income of billion which included billion in income from the settlement of our antitrust litigation and an as adjusted pretax loss of million for the year ended discover card sales volume was up for the year ended november  as compared to reflecting higher average spend per customer and a continued increase in merchant acceptance 
loan receivables totaled billion at november   which was down from billion at november  as adjusted  reflecting a decline in credit card loans and federal student loans  partially offset by an increase in personal loans and private student loans 
although sales volumes increased  credit card loans declined as a result of a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate 
in  we sold billion in federal student loans to the us department of education and classified the remaining million of federal student loan balances as held for sale 
net interest income declined during as compared to as adjusted  largely due to a decline in the average level of credit card loan receivables as well as a lower net interest margin 
the decline in net interest margin is reflective of the impact of legislative changes on credit card yield and an increase in the average level of lower rate student loan balances  partially offset by higher interest rates earned on standard balances and fewer promotional rate balances 
at november   our over days delinquency rate was as compared to at november  as adjusted  reflective of continued improvement in credit performance 
for the year ended november   our net charge off rate declined to  compared to for the year ended november  as adjusted

loan receivables of billion at november  as adjusted were relatively unchanged from november  as adjusted as lower payments from our credit card customers and growth in both student and personal loans were largely offset by lower balance transfer activity and sales volume 
net interest income increased in as adjusted compared to as adjusted due to the impact of higher interest rates earned on standard balances  a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances and lower interest rates on borrowings  partially offset by higher interest charge offs 
other income decreased during as adjusted as compared to as adjusted  primarily due a decrease in loan fee income partially offset by increases in discount and interchange revenue  fee product revenue and lower losses on investment securities 
other expense decreased during as adjusted compared to  reflecting the impact of lower marketing and litigation expenses along with cost containment initiatives  such as a reduction of headcount 
additionally  other expenses in were lower due to a million benefit related to the curtailment of our pension plan 
payment services for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  our payment services segment reported pretax income of million for the year ended november   up million as compared to the year ended november  revenues were up million as a result of increased volumes from new and existing clients  as well as higher margins from transactions on the pulse network 
expenses were down million primarily due to transaction processing cost reduction initiatives as well as a lower level of international marketing investments 
transaction dollar volume for the year ended november  was billion  an increase of compared to the year ended november  the increase in transaction dollar volume was driven by higher volumes from all three contributors of our payments business  particularly pulse volume

table of contents for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  our payment services segment reported pretax income of million for the year ended november   up million as compared to the year ended november  revenues were up million mainly driven by increased transaction volume on the pulse network  along with lower incentive payments and higher fee revenue 
expenses were also up million including a higher level of international marketing investments  partially offset by the impact of cost containment initiatives 
additionally  the increase in both revenues and expenses during is due to the inclusion of diners club for the full year  as compared to half a year since its acquisition in june transaction dollar volume for the year ended november  was billion  an increase of compared to the year ended november  the increase in transaction dollar volume was driven primarily by the inclusion of diners club for the full year  as compared to a half a year in  in addition to higher activity from new and existing financial institutions on the pulse network 
these were partially offset by the loss of volume from one large financial institution along with lower third party issuer volume as a result of lower gasoline prices and lower overall spending 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain 
for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity  it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period 
for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions  significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain cases  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 
management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses  the accrual of credit card customer rewards cost  the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates 
allowance for loan losses we base our allowance for loan loss on several analyses that help us estimate incurred losses as of the balance sheet date 
while our estimation process includes historical data and analysis  there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance 
we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables 
in the first quarter  management refined its ability to estimate loss emergence by using other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts 
the considerations in these analyses include past performance  risk management techniques applied to various accounts  historical behavior of different account vintages  current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies  bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates  and forecasting uncertainties 
given the same information  others may reach different reasonable conclusions 
if management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net loan losses  the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in management s estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan losses at november   with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses 
see loan quality and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for loan losses 
customer rewards cost we offer our customers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program  pursuant to which we offer certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer s purchases 
the liability for customer rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we compute our rewards liability on an individual customer basis and it is accumulated as qualified customers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity 
the liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical account 
table of contents closure and charge off experience  actual customer purchase activity and the terms of the rewards programs 
we recognize reward costs as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
if management used a different estimate of forfeitures  our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed 
for example  a basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of november   could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately million 
the corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue 
see other income and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about credit card rewards cost 
goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets we recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the total of the fair values of the acquired net assets 
in addition  we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the diners club business 
as required by gaap  we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  management must estimate the fair value of the business unit s to which the goodwill relates 
because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable  other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses 
similarly  in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment  management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models 
in applying these techniques  management considers historical results  business forecasts  market and industry conditions and other factors 
we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques 
the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance  revenue and expense growth  discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature 
if economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the assumptions used by management in these valuations  we may be exposed to an impairment loss that  when recognized  could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
at november   there were no reporting units or intangible assets that were at reasonable risk for failing the respective impairment evaluations 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations  primarily the united states  its states and municipalities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and tax reserves are established as appropriate 
changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes  interpretations of tax laws  the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities  and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken 
when such changes occur  the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant

net interest income the tables that follow this section have been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income  net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes on net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets 
we analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin interest income  net of interest expense  as a percentage of average total loan receivables 
we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources  along with the income generated by our liquidity investment portfolio  on net interest income 
our interest earning assets consist of i loan receivables  ii cash and cash equivalents  which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve  highly rated certificates of deposit  and triple a rated government mutual funds  iii restricted cash  iv short term investments and v investment securities 
our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits  both direct to consumer and brokered  and long term borrowings  including amounts owed to securitization investors 
net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of loan receivables  including the proportion of credit card loans to other consumer loans  as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates  the credit performance of our loans  particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges  which reduce interest income  the terms of long term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering  including maturity and interest rate  the level and composition of other interest bearing assets and liabilities  including our liquidity investment portfolio  changes in the interest rate environment  including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices  such as the prime rate  the federal funds rate and libor  and the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program 
for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net interest income was billion for the year ended november   a decline of as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted 
the decline in net interest income was primarily due to a lower average level of credit card loan receivables as well as a decline in net interest margin 

table of contents net interest margin was for the year ended november   down basis points as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted 
this reflects a greater proportion of lower rate student loans in our loan portfolio for much of the year  lower rates earned on higher balances in our liquidity investment portfolio and higher rates paid on long term borrowings  partially offset by lower deposit funding costs and an improvement in credit card yield 
yield on credit card loan receivables improved as a result of fewer promotional rate balances and higher interest rates earned on standard balances  partially offset by the impact of legislative changes related to restrictions on increasing interest rates on existing balances beginning in february although the yield on credit card loan receivables was higher for the full year as compared to as adjusted  the credit card yield during the fourth quarter was lower than the fourth quarter as adjusted 
in  we expect the credit card yield to decline as a result of the continued impact of the implementation of card act provisions and a planned increase in promotional rate offers 
the level of net interest income also declined during the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted  because of a decline in the average level of credit card loan receivables  which was driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate 
this was partially offset by an increase in the level of student loans and a higher average level of liquidity 
interest expense declined slightly for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted largely as a result of lower interest expense on securitized debt and deposits offset by higher expense associated with subordinated debt issuances in late and april interest expense on securitized debt declined because of a significant level of maturities in the first half of interest expense on deposits declined as the decline in deposit interest rates more than offset the higher level of deposit borrowings  which replaced the maturing asset backed securities 
for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net interest income was billion for the year ended november  as adjusted  an increase of as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted 
the increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in net interest margin along with an increase in the average level of loan receivables 
net interest margin was for the year ended november  as adjusted  up basis points as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted 
the increase was due to lower funding costs partially offset by a lower yield on our loan receivables and liquidity investment portfolio 
in  interest expense was negatively impacted by the disruptions in the capital markets  which caused the differential between libor the rate to which our securitized borrowings are benchmarked and the federal funds rate which impacts the prime rate  the rate to which our floating rate credit card receivables are benchmarked 
by  the differential between libor and the federal funds rate had narrowed to more normalized ranges 
the yield on loan receivables was for the year ended november  as adjusted  down basis points as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted due to a higher level of student and personal loans  which earn lower interest rates 
the yield on credit card loans was in both as adjusted and as adjusted as an increase in rates on standard balances and a reduction in promotional rate balances were offset by an increase in finance charge charge offs 
the increase in net interest income in as adjusted as compared to as adjusted was also due to an increase in the average level of loan receivables 
this was primarily attributable to a decline in the credit card payment rate and an increase in both student and personal loan receivable balances  partially offset by lower balance transfer activity and lower sales volume 
interest expense declined significantly for the period ending november  as adjusted compared to the same period in as adjusted primarily due to a decline in funding costs related to securitized borrowings as discussed above 
throughout we grew our deposits business  which provided a significant source of funds while the securitization market was disrupted 
due to the decline in benchmark deposit rates throughout  our cost of funds related to deposits improved during as compared to

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date 
factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer  including unemployment levels  bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  changes in our loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio  the level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge offs  the credit quality of the loan portfolio  which reflects  among other factors  our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts  and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance 
in calculating the allowance for loan losses  we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics  such as credit card and other consumer loans 
for our credit card loans  we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency 
we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts which broadens the identification of loss emergence 
we use these analyses together to determine our allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended november   the provision for loan losses decreased billion as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted 
this decrease is attributable to lower net charge offs  discussed in net charge offs below  and a reduction in the allowance for loan losses 
the reduction in the allowance for loan losses was due to improved delinquency statistics  which resulted in lower loan loss reserve rates  as well as a billion decline in the level of credit card loans 
more specifically  our allowance at november  was billion  a decline of million as compared to november  as adjusted 
this full year net reduction in the allowance includes a million increase to the allowance in the first quarter upon management s consideration of refined analytics that expanded its ability to identify loss emergence 
by comparison  the allowance for loan losses at november  as adjusted was billion  an increase of billion as compared to the prior year 
for the year ended november  as adjusted  the provision for loan losses increased billion  or  compared to the year ended november  as adjusted  primarily due to higher net charge offs resulting from the deterioration in the economic environment 
additionally  because of rising delinquencies  the loan loss reserve rate increased basis points in as adjusted and we added billion to our as adjusted allowance for loan losses 
in comparison  the reserve rate increased basis points in as adjusted and we added billion to our as adjusted allowance for loan losses 
for other consumer loans  we consider historical and forecasted losses in estimating the related allowance for loan losses 
at november   the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans decreased by million as compared to november  this is largely attributable to a decline in our personal loan reserve rate due to credit improvement in that portfolio 
this was partially offset by a reserve increase related to a higher level of private student loans 
at november   the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans increased by million as compared to november  mainly due to increased personal loan and private student loan balances

the following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of loan receivables dollars in thousands for the years ended november  as adjusted as adjusted as adjusted as adjusted credit card loans other consumer loans total net charge offs information related to credit card loan receivables and total loan receivables is presented on an as adjusted basis 
no adjustments have been made for other consumer loan receivables 
see reconciliation in reconciliations of gaap to as adjusted data 
the amount of charge offs on credit card loans decreased for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  as adjusted 
the level of contractual and bankruptcy charge offs had peaked by the end of the first quarter of and then declined throughout as a result of improvement in the economic environment and recoveries 
however  the net charge off rate on our credit card loans increased slightly for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  as adjusted due to a lower average level of credit card loans 
the seasoning of our personal loan portfolio has led to higher charge off amounts in other consumer loans during the year ended november  as compared to  but the charge off rate for other consumer loans declined overall due to an increase in the average level of student loans  as newly originated student loans had not yet entered into repayment and  thus  had minimal levels of net charge offs 
the increase in our charge off rate and amount on our loan receivables for the year ended november  as adjusted compared to november  as adjusted is reflective of the weakened economic environment  including rising unemployment  an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs and a decrease in the availability of consumer credit during the period 
additionally  personal loans  which are included in other consumer loans  grew significantly in and into  had seasoned and had started to experience charge offs 
delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time 
loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due 
credit card and closed end consumer loan receivables are placed on nonaccrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a customer or suspected fraudulent activity on an account 
in some cases of suspected fraudulent activity  loan receivables may resume accruing interest upon completion of the fraud investigation 

table of contents the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over days delinquent  loan receivables over days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest  regardless of delinquency dollars in thousands at november  as adjusted as adjusted as adjusted as adjusted loans over days delinquent loans over days delinquent and accruing interest loans not accruing interest see reconciliation in reconciliations of gaap to as adjusted data 
the delinquency rates of loans over days delinquent and loans over days delinquent and accruing interest decreased basis points and basis points  respectively at november  as compared to november  as adjusted 
the decline in delinquency rates is mainly due to better credit trends as well as enhanced collection management and underwriting processes 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  decreased basis points to  as compared to november  as adjusted  as a result of a decrease in bankruptcy notifications 
the delinquency rates of loans over days delinquent and loans over days delinquent and accruing interest increased basis points and basis points  respectively at november  as adjusted  as compared to november  as adjusted 
the increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our customers ability to pay their loan balances 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  increased basis points to as adjusted  as compared to november  as adjusted  as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications 
maturities and sensitivities of loan receivables to changes in interest rates our loan portfolio had the following maturity distribution at november  dollars in thousands due one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years total credit card loans other consumer loans total loan portfolio because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns  the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments 
historically  actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments and  therefore  the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments 
at november   approximately billion of our loan portfolio due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately billion were fixed rate loans 
modified and restructured loans we hold various credit card loans for which the terms have been modified  including some that are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings 
our modified credit card loans include loans for which temporary hardship concessions have been granted and loans in permanent workout programs 
eligibility  frequency  duration and offer type for both of these programs are designed to comply with regulatory guidelines 
temporary hardship concessions primarily consist of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction  both lasting for a period no longer than twelve months 
these short term concessions do not include the forgiveness of unpaid 
table of contents principal  but may involve the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments 
at the end of the concession period  loan terms revert to standard rates 
these arrangements are automatically terminated if the customer makes two consecutive late payments  at which time their account reverts back to its original terms 
in assessing the appropriate allowance for loan loss  these loans are included in the general pool of credit cards with the allowance determined under the contingent loss model of asc  loss contingencies guidance formerly contained in fasb statement no 

we do not consider these loans in the troubled debt restructuring tdr pool 
if we applied accounting under asc  troubled debt restructurings by creditors guidance formerly contained in fasb statement no 
 to loans in this program  there would not be a material difference in the allowance 
loans for which temporary hardship concessions were granted comprised less than of our total credit card loans at november  and november  in contrast to temporary hardship concessions  our permanent workout programs entail more significant and permanent concessions including changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than months 
the concessions associated with a permanent workout also include a significant reduction in interest rate and possible waivers of unpaid interest and fees 
we account for permanent workout loans as tdrs and  as a result  we measure impairment of these loans based on the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be received on them 
loans in permanent workout programs comprised less than of our total credit card loans at november  and november  we also participate in consumer credit counseling agency ccca programs in an effort to assist customers to proactively manage their credit card balances 
the vast majority of loans entering ccca programs are not delinquent at the time of enrollment  and our charge off rate on these loans is comparable or less than the rate on our overall credit card receivables portfolio 
these loans continue to be subject to original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal  interest or fees 
in assessing the appropriate allowance for loan loss  these loans are included in the general pool of credit card loans with the allowance determined under the contingent loss model 
we do not consider these loans in the tdr pool 
if we applied tdr accounting to loans in this program  there would not be a material difference in the allowance

table of contents total other income decreased slightly for the year ended november  as adjusted  as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted 
this is primarily attributable to a decrease in loan fee income partially offset by increases in fee product income and lower losses on investment securities 
these key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below 
discount and interchange revenue discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third party issuers in the united states 
we earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions 
we earn acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all discover network card transactions made by credit card customers at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions 
we incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the discover network 
this cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organization s transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue 
we offer our customers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program  pursuant to which we pay certain customers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer s purchases 
reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue 
in we had higher sales volume than  which was the key driver of the increase in discount and interchange revenue 
in total  our gross discount and interchange revenue increased by million for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted  which was partially offset by a million increase in cashback bonus rewards earned by our customers 
discount and interchange revenue increased slightly for the year ended november   as adjusted compared to the year ended november   as adjusted  due to lower customer rewards costs  partially offset by lower revenues earned on lower sales volume 
lower customer rewards costs were due to a decline in sales volume  partially offset by adjustments made in the third quarter of to the rewards liability for an increase in expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards 
fee products we earn revenue related to fees received for selling ancillary products and services including debt deferment debt cancellation and identity theft protection services to customers 
the amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customer s outstanding balance or a flat fee and is recognized over the agreement or contract period as earned 
fee products income increased slightly for the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november  as adjusted primarily due to an increase in revenue from our identity theft protection product 
fee products income increased for the year ended november  as adjusted  as compared to the year ended as adjusted  largely due to an increase in the revenue from our debt deferment debt cancellation product and from our identity theft protection product 
additionally  fee products income increased in as compared to due to higher balances upon which the fees are based 
loan fee income loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late  overlimit  cash advance  pay by phone and other miscellaneous fees 
however  effective february  as a result of legislative changes  we no longer charge overlimit or pay by phone fees on consumer credit card loans 
the legislative changes also resulted in changes to our late fee policy beginning august in  loan fee income decreased substantially as compared to as adjusted  primarily due to the legislative changes mentioned above 
we had a minimal level of overlimit fees in as compared to million in as adjusted  which was the last year in which we charged overlimit fees throughout the entire year overlimit fees were million in on a gaap basis 
additionally  our late fee income declined by million in as compared to as adjusted 
this was due in part to the legislative changes mentioned above  but also due to a higher level of late payment incidences in as a result of the credit environment at that time 
in as adjusted  loan fee income decreased as compared to as adjusted  primarily due to deferrals of balance transfer fees and higher charge offs and adjustments of loan fees  partially offset by an increase in income from late fees as discussed above 

table of contents merchant fees to broaden merchant acceptance of discover network cards  we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late we have also sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and to reduce costs 
as we have moved away from direct merchant relationships  our merchant fee income and related costs have declined from million in to million in and million in the lower income per transaction is generally offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance 
transaction processing revenue transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing atm  debit and point of sale transactions over the pulse network  as well as various participation and membership fees 
switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis 
transaction processing revenue increased in as compared to  due to higher transaction volumes and higher margins at pulse 
transaction processing revenue increased for as compared to primarily due to increased volumes partially offset by pricing incentives offered to financial institutions  which are accounted for as an offset to transaction processing revenue 
gain loss on investment securities gain loss on investment securities includes realized gains and losses on the sale of investments as well as any write downs of investment securities to fair value when the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary

table of contents total other expense decreased million in as compared to as adjusted 
employee compensation and benefits expense decreased as we benefitted from cost containment initiatives undertaken in  which included lowering headcount 
information processing and communications expense was lower in than in due to our efforts to reduce costs associated with ongoing contracts 
other expense was lower in due to i a million nonrecurring benefit related to the reversal of expense that had been recorded related to the payment to morgan stanley under an amendment to the special dividend agreement see note litigation to our consolidated financial statements  ii a million restructuring charge recorded during the second quarter as a result of the reduction in headcount and iii a million decline in costs relating to fraud 
these declines in expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses  due to increased advertising and promotional marketing expenses and higher investments in account acquisition  and an increase in professional fees  due to higher collection fees and advisory expenses related to the acquisition of the student loan corporation 
total other expense decreased million in as adjusted as compared to expenses were lower overall reflecting the impact of cost containment initiatives such as a reduction of headcount  lower marketing and lower litigation expense 
marketing expenses decreased million primarily due to a reduction in new account acquisition 
other expense increased million due to the inclusion of a full year of diners club expenses compared to only six months in  a million charge related to a reduction in force  increased costs associated with the global expansion initiative and a charge related to a facility closure 
additionally  in  other expense included a million benefit due to the curtailment of our pension plan 
these increases in other expense were partially offset by lower postage  supplies and credit bureau fees resulting from lower account acquisition activity and fraud costs 
income tax expense for  we had tax expense of million as compared to a tax benefit of million for as adjusted 
the increase was the result of shifting from an as adjusted pretax loss position in to a pretax income position in also includes million of state tax expense which is attributable to an increase in pretax income and tax liabilities in additional states

also had a higher effective state tax rate due to estimated taxes payable in additional states 
liquidity and capital resources funding and liquidity we seek to maintain diversified funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations 
in addition  we seek to achieve an appropriate maturity profile  utilize a cost effective mix of funding sources and ensure that the composition of our funding sources provides appropriate diversification 
our primary funding sources include deposits  sourced directly from consumers or through brokers  term asset backed securitizations  private asset backed securitizations and long term borrowings 
funding sources deposits 
we offer deposit products  including certificates of deposit  money market accounts  online savings accounts and individual retirement account ira certificates of deposit  to customers through two channels i through direct marketing  internet origination and affinity relationships direct to consumer deposits  and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits 
since november   direct to consumer deposits have grown billion  or  which includes approximately billion of deposit accounts acquired in march from a third party 
at november   we had billion of direct to consumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits since november   we have deemphasized the brokered deposit channel in favor of our direct to consumer deposit program 
remaining maturities of our certificates of deposit range from one month to ten years  with a weighted average maturity of months at november  
table of contents the following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity as of november  dollars in thousands total three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months certificates of deposit in amounts less than  certificates of deposit in amounts of  to less than certificates of deposit in amounts of  or greater savings deposits  including money market deposit accounts total interest bearing deposits  represents the basic insurance amount previously covered by the fdic 
effective july   the basic insurance per depositor was permanently increased to  credit card securitization financing 
we use the securitization of credit card receivables as an additional source of funding 
we access the asset backed securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent  through which we issue asset backed securities both publicly and through private transactions 
the dcmt structure utilizes class a and class b certificates held by third parties  with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated class b certificates  cash collateral accounts discussed below and subordinated series ce 
the dcent structure utilizes four classes of securities with declining levels of seniority class a  b  c and d  with credit enhancement provided by the more subordinated classes of notes 
both dcmt and dcent are further enhanced by series sd through its provisions to reallocate principal cash flows  thereby enhancing the excess spread  discussed below  of both trusts 
we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of subordinated security classes of dcmt and dcent 
the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to certain dcmt certificates were million at november  and were recorded in restricted cash for securitization investors in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
these cash collateral accounts were partially funded through a loan facility entered into between a consolidated special purpose subsidiary  drfc funding llc  and third party lenders 
at november   million of the drfc funding llc facility was outstanding and was recorded in long term borrowings in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
this loan facility was repaid on december  the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements  the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities 
we refer to this as economic early amortization  which is based on excess spread levels 
excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period  including interest collections  fees and interchange  as well as the amount of certain principal collections available to be reallocated from series sd exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period  including interest expense  servicing fees and charged off receivables 
in the event of an economic early amortization  which would occur if the excess spread fell below for a contractually specified period  generally a three month rolling average  we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings over a period of months using all available collections received by the trust the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received 
an early amortization event would negatively impact our liquidity  and require us to utilize our available contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources  which may or may not be available at the time 
as of november   the month rolling average excess spread was 
another feature of our securitization structure  which is applicable only to the notes issued from dcent  is a reserve account funding requirement in which excess cash flows generated by the transferred loan receivables are held at the trust 
this funding requirement is triggered when dcent s three month average excess spread rate decreases to below  with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels to 
see note 
table of contents credit card securitization activities to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the structures of dcmt and dcent and for tables providing information concerning investors interests and related excess spreads at november  at november   we had billion of outstanding public asset backed securities  billion of outstanding private asset backed securitizations and billion of outstanding asset backed securities that had been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries at november  dollars in thousands total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of long term borrowings owed to securitization investors at november   we had capacity to issue up to billion in triple a rated asset backed securities from dcent without the issuance of additional class b or class c notes as subordination 
the triple a rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based  in part  on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic  as conservator or receiver  will not  using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts  seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization  or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution  provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap 
pursuant to amendments to gaap related to transfers of financial assets  effective for us on december   certain transfers of assets that previously qualified for sale accounting treatment under gaap no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment 
however  on september   the fdic approved a final rule that preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts as long as the securitizations would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december  other legislative and regulatory developments  namely the proposed sec regulation ab ii  the securitization and rating agency provisions of the reform act and the federal banking agencies notice regarding their consideration of replacement of the ratings based approach for assessing capital charges against securitization exposures  may  however  impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future

short term borrowings 
short term borrowings include any debt or time deposits with original maturities of months or less 
we primarily access short term borrowings through the federal funds market or through repurchase agreements 
in the past two years  we have rarely used short term borrowings 
in fiscal year  we entered into one overnight repurchase agreement for million 
at november  we had no outstanding short term borrowings 
however  in december  we entered into one overnight repurchase agreement for million and began accessing the federal funds market 
the level of short term borrowings used by us in the future will depend on our liquidity needs and market conditions 
long term borrowings 
at november   we had billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding  reflecting two issuances of million each of fixed rate senior unsecured notes  one maturing in june and the other maturing in july these notes would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade 
as of november   discover bank had a total of billion in principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding  which included million due in november and million due in april ecasla 
the ensuring continued access to student loans act of as amended  ecasla provides originators of federal family education loan program ffelp loans with a cost effective source of funding and liquidity with respect to qualifying ffelp loans

the student loan corporation acquisition 
on december   we acquired the student loan corporation slc in a merger transaction in which we acquired approximately billion of private student loans and other assets  along with assuming approximately billion of slc s existing asset backed securitization debt funding and other liabilities 
the acquisition significantly increased the size of our private student loan portfolio and long term borrowings owed to securitization investors 
additional funding sources private asset backed securitizations 
we have access to committed undrawn capacity through privately placed asset backed securitizations to support the funding of our credit card loan receivables 
under these arrangements  we had used billion of capacity and had an undrawn capacity of billion at november  unsecured committed credit facility 
our unsecured committed credit facility of billion is available through may this facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity 
this facility is provided by a group of major global banks  and is available to both discover financial services and discover bank discover financial services may borrow up to and discover bank may borrow up to of the total commitment 
the facility is available to support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time 
the terms of the credit facility include various affirmative and negative covenants  including financial covenants related to the maintenance of certain capitalization and tangible net worth levels  and certain double leverage  delinquency and tier capital to managed loans ratios 
the credit facility also includes customary events of default with corresponding grace periods  including  without limitation  payment defaults  cross defaults to other agreements evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money and bankruptcy related defaults 
the facility may be terminated upon an event of default 
we have no outstanding balances due under the facility 
federal reserve 
discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window 
as of november   discover bank had billion of available capacity through the discount window based on the amount of assets pledged 
we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window 
credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets  including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt  may be affected by the credit ratings of discover financial services  discover bank and the securitization trusts 
downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations  as well as potentially higher fees related to borrowings under our lines of credit 
in addition to increased funding costs  deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets 
we also have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require discover bank s debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies 
if discover bank s credit rating is reduced to below investment grade  we would be required to post additional collateral  which  as of november   would have been million

see legislative and regulatory developments for information regarding the reform act 
liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations  fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations 
in the assessment of our liquidity needs  we also evaluate a range of stress events that would impact our access to normal funding sources  cash needs and or liquidity 
we maintain contingent funding sources  including our liquidity investment portfolio  private securitizations with unused capacity  committed credit facility capacity and federal reserve discount window capacity  which we could seek to utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during such stress events 
we expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during the next months by utilizing our deposit channels and our contingent funding sources 
we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across the company  which is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee the alco 
we seek to balance the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity  which may limit financial flexibility and be costly  with having too little liquidity that could cause financial distress 
liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco  which is chaired by our cfo and has cross functional membership 
the alco monitors positions and determines any actions that need to be taken 
at november   our liquidity investment portfolio was comprised of cash and cash equivalents and high quality  liquid investments 
cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in deposits with the federal reserve and aaa rated government money market mutual funds 
investments included highly rated certificates of deposit  credit card asset backed securities of other issuers plus us treasury  us government agency and aaa rated corporate debt obligations issued under the temporary liquidity guarantee program that are guaranteed by the fdic  all of which are considered highly liquid

capital our primary sources of capital are from the earnings generated by our businesses and issuances in the capital markets 
we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses  meet regulatory requirements  adhere to rating agency guidelines and support future business growth 
within these constraints  we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders 
the level  composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment  strategic initiatives  and legislative and regulatory developments 
see legislative and regulatory developments international initiatives related to capital and liquidity for a discussion of recent initiatives related to capital matters 
under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the fdic  the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies  we  along with discover bank  must maintain minimum levels of capital 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results 
we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance 
we maintain a substantial deferred tax asset on our balance sheet  and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels 
however  for regulatory capital purposes  deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income are currently limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets we expect to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on our projected future taxable income for that year  or ii of the amount of our tier capital

our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of november  are summarized below dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years more than five years deposits long term borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases interest payments on fixed rate debt purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations deposits do not include interest charges 
see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate notes is estimated to be million as of november   utilizing the current interest rates as of that date 
purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under  among other things  consulting  outsourcing  data  advertising  sponsorship  software license and telecommunications agreements 
purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants 
purchase obligations at november  reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
these amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition 
other long term liabilities include our expected future contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
as of november  our consolidated statement of financial condition reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  and approximately million of accrued interest and penalties 
since the ultimate amount and 
table of contents timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  the estimated income tax obligations about which there is uncertainty  as addressed in asc topic  income taxes  guidance formerly provided by fasb interpretation no 
 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our tax obligations 
we extend credit for consumer and commercial loans  primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards  provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement 
during  our unused commitments were reduced by billion to billion at november   as part of our risk management strategies 
these commitments  substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties 
the activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk 
we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers  as well as invest in other assets and our business 
these loans and other assets earn interest  which we use to pay interest on the money borrowed 
our net interest income and  therefore  earnings  will be negatively affected if the interest rate earned on assets increases at a slower pace than increases to the interest rate we owe on our borrowings 
changes in interest rates and competitor responses to those changes may influence customer payment rates  loan balances or deposit account activity 
we may face higher cost alternative sources of funding as a result  which has the potential to decrease earnings 
our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the mix of variable and fixed rate assets 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve our objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate 
see note derivatives and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for information on our derivatives activity 
we use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from our reporting date  we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously  simultaneously and to the same degree 
our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity investment portfolio 
due to recently enacted credit card legislation  we now have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances 
at november   the majority of our credit card loans were at variable rates 
beginning in the third quarter  we began using interest rate derivatives to reduce the asset sensitivity that resulted from having a larger percentage of our loan portfolio at variable rates 
assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are considered to be rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the 
table of contents full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index  such as federal funds or libor  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  also are considered to be rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimate that net interest income over the following month period would increase by approximately million  or 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november  we estimated that net interest income over the following month period would increase by approximately million  or 
the decline in the estimated impact of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates at november  as compared to november   was primarily driven by reducing the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet through the use of interest rate derivatives 
specifically  beginning in the third quarter  we entered into interest rate derivative agreements under which we receive a fixed interest rate on forecasted cash flows related to variable rate credit card receivables 
we anticipate that the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet will be reduced further with continued management of our balance sheet sensitivity and through the use of derivatives 
we have not provided an estimate of any impact on net interest income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels and  therefore  could not materially decrease further
