we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of our three most recent fiscal years and our financial condition at december  except for historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading global provider of time critical and technologically complex printed circuit board pcb products and backplane assemblies pcbs populated with electronic components  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we provide our customers time to market and advanced technology products and offer a one stop manufacturing solution to customers from engineering support to prototype development through final volume production 
we serve a diversified customer base in various markets throughout the world  including manufacturers of networking communications infrastructure products  personal computers  touch screen tablets and mobile media devices cellular phones and smart phones 
we also serve high end computing  commercial aerospace defense  and industrial medical industries 
our customers include both original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing services ems providers 
in april  we acquired from meadville all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of four of its subsidiaries 
these four companies and their respective subsidiaries  collectively referred to as the pcb subsidiaries  comprised meadville s pcb manufacturing and distributing business 
see note in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the combination of our legacy business and the pcb subsidiaries will increase our diversification and allow us to better address a number of industry trends and other operational challenges impacting us ability to meet customer demand for a one stop manufacturing solution 
as a result of the business combination  we are now a leading global pcb company with high technology capabilities and a highly diversified revenue mix by geographic region and end market 
in addition  we can now offer our customers a one stop global manufacturing solution from quick turn through volume production and a focused facility specialization strategy 
ability to respond to increasing global competition 
we now can capitalize on potential economies of scale  cost savings and access to a highly trained workforce  a global sales force  and flexible manufacturing platform  complementary footprints  customers and end markets  and talented management teams with leading expertise in the asian market 
ability to continue expanding market presence and capitalizing on new opportunities 
we can now capture additional business globally from both existing and new customers  particularly in north america and europe 
we believe that these factors position us to compete effectively in our industry by allowing us to respond to technologically complex and time sensitive customer demands and increasing competition from other global manufacturers 
while our customers include both oem and ems providers  we measure customers based on oem companies as they are the ultimate end customers 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed orders of  or more in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately  customers and as of december  we had approximately customers 
sales to our largest customers accounted for and of our net sales in and  respectively 
we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 

table of contents the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated 
end markets aerospace defense cellular phone computing storage peripherals medical industrial instrumentation other networking communications other total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
for pcbs  we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
we also deliver a significant percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we typically receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of pcbs and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective pcbs and backplane assemblies 
we record an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products as well as stock based compensation expense 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume  and yield 
we generally do not participate in any significant long term contracts with suppliers  with the exception of the supply arrangement to purchase laminate and prepregs from a related party controlled by a significant shareholder  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff  stock based compensation expense as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  bad debt expense  gains or losses on the sale or disposal of property  plant and equipment  and acquisition related expenses 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  derivative instruments and hedging activities  realizability of deferred tax assets  establishing the fair value of individual assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interest when we acquire other businesses  and determining self insured reserves 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and judgments as to expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
inventories in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
when the market value of inventory is less than the carrying value  the inventory cost is written down to their estimated net realizable value thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements with those customers 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
sales returns and allowances we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenue upon delivery 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale using our judgment based on historical information and anticipated returns as a result of current period sales 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our 
table of contents acquisitions of other businesses 
as necessary  we make judgments regarding future cash flow forecasts in the determination of impairment 
we have two operating segments  north america and asia pacific 
during the fourth quarter of each year  and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation  we perform our annual impairment assessment of goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows and market approach analyses as considered necessary and consider factors such as a weakened economy  reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with a decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period as indicators for potential goodwill impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as of december   our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair value of goodwill for our north america segment was substantially in excess of its estimated carrying values  and therefore goodwill for the north america segment was not impaired 
for our asia pacific segment  which consists of the pcb subsidiaries acquired in april  we did not assess for goodwill impairment as we recently finalized the assignment of estimated fair values to assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests 
further  we did not find evidence of indicators for potential goodwill impairment  such as a weakened economy  reduced expectations for future cash flows  or a decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period 
we also assess other long lived assets  specifically definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment  for potential impairment given similar impairment indicators 
when indicators of impairment exist related to our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  we use an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether the carrying amount of the assets is recoverable 
measurement of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including market and income approaches as considered necessary  which involve judgments related to future cash flows and the application of the appropriate valuation model 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our goodwill and other long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
derivative instruments and hedging activities as a matter of policy  we use derivatives for risk management purposes  and we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are typically entered into as hedges of changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and other risks 
when we determine to designate a derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged  how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed  and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivative that is used in hedging transactions is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet with measurement at fair value 
fair value of the derivative instruments is determined using pricing models developed based on the underlying swap interest rate  foreign currency exchange rates  and other observable market data as appropriate 
the values are also adjusted to reflect nonperformance risk of both the counterparty and the company 
for derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  to the extent the derivative is effective at offsetting the changes in cash flow being hedged until the hedged item affects earnings 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings each period 

table of contents income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
in addition  we are subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
additionally  our calculations of income taxes are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interest 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the fair value of the real property was estimated primarily via the cost approach  and where applicable  the sales comparison approach and income approach 
the procedures employed included site inspections  analysis of the subject properties  review of the highest and best use of the subject properties  discussions with onsite property management  determinations regarding future use of the facilities  review of real property market data available in the local market  estimation of replacement cost  new and typical expected useful lives  and the calculation of all factors of obsolescence 
for the fair value of the personal property we utilized the cost approach as the primary approach for valuing the majority of the personal property 
the market approach was used to estimate the value of certain equipment commonly traded in the second hand marketplace  as well as computers and computer related assets 
the income approach was used to quantify any economic obsolescence that may be present in the subject assets 
our analysis also entailed an estimation of useful lives  which were researched and discussed with property management and market sources 
the fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of personal property assets by market participants 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer relationships  trade name  and order backlog 
the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships  estimating cash flows from existing backlog  market position of the trade name  as well as assumptions about cash flow savings from the trade name  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change during the measurement period as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interest as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
self insurance we are primarily self insured in north america for group health insurance and worker s compensation benefits provided to our us employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against annual claims at the individual and aggregate level 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not reported at the end of each reporting period 
we use our judgment using our historical claim data and information and analysis provided by actuarial and claim 
table of contents advisors  our insurance carriers and brokers on an annual basis to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to individual insured stop loss coverage for both programs which is  per individual 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
results of operations the years ended december  and do not include the results of operations from our acquired pcb subsidiaries  as the acquisition occurred on april  the acquisition has had and will continue to have a significant effect on our operations as discussed in the various comparisons noted below 
included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  are days of results of operations for the asia pacific operations for the period from april  through december  the following table sets forth the relationship of various items to net sales in our consolidated statement of operations year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of definite lived intangibles restructuring charges impairment of goodwill and long lived assets metal reclamation total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense other  net total other expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income loss attributable to ttm technologies  inc stockholders prior to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  we had two operating segments  pcb manufacturing and backplane assembly  consistent with the nature of our operations 
due to the acquisition  we reassessed our operating segments and now manage our worldwide operations based on two geographic operating segments north america  which consists of seven domestic pcb fabrication plants  including a facility that provides follow on value added services primarily for one of the pcb fabrication plants  and one backplane assembly plant in shanghai  china  which is managed in conjunction with our us operations and its related european sales support infrastructure  and asia pacific  which consists of the pcb subsidiaries and their seven pcb fabrication plants  which include a substrate facility 
each segment operates predominantly in the same industry with production facilities that produce similar customized products for our customers and use similar means of product distribution in their respective geographic regions 

table of contents the following table compares net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net sales north america asia pacific total sales inter segment sales total net sales net sales total net sales increased million  from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april  which comprise our asia pacific segment 
net sales for the north america segment remained consistent with net sales of million for the year ended december  and net sales of million for the year ended december  sales volume at a number of our facilities increased due to the improving economy and the transfer of work from our closed facilities partially offset by the lost revenue resulting from the closure of our los angeles  california facility in november  and our hayward  california facility in march the revenue reflects a decrease of in our average pcb selling price from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and an increase in pcb volume of from the year ended december  as compared to december  due to the improving economy 
total net sales  all of which were attributable to our north america segment  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to reduced demand at most of our production facilities resulting from a downturn in the global economy and due to the shutdown of our redmond  washington production facility at the end of march and our los angeles  california facility at the end of november these manufacturing facilities were closed as part of our strategy to concentrate our production at fewer facilities during a period of industry wide reduced demand 
pcb volume declined approximately due to reduced demand while prices rose approximately due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which we measure as orders placed and shipped within days  decreased from approximately of pcb sales for the year ended december  to approximately of pcb sales for the year ended december  the increasingly complex nature of our quick turn work requires more time to manufacture  thereby extending some of these orders beyond the day delivery window 
the decrease in revenue is also attributable to reduced volume at our hayward  california production facility in conjunction with the closure announced on september  this backplane assembly facility was closed in due to a steady decline in volume over several years 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april  which comprise our asia pacific segment 
cost of goods sold for the north america segment decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due primarily to increased production volume partially offset by reduced overhead from the facility closures discussed above  as well as lower direct material costs due to lower volumes of backplane assemblies  which inherently have a higher material content 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for the year ended 
table of contents december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to cost savings from our closed facilities and increased absorption of fixed costs across a smaller plant footprint following the closure of our los angeles and hayward  california facilities 
cost of goods sold  all of which were attributable to our north america segment  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due primarily to the decline in pcb volume discussed above 
the decrease in cost of goods sold was mostly driven by lower labor and direct material costs associated with lower production volume 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to reduced absorption of fixed costs on lower volume and inventory write off costs related to the closure of our redmond  washington and los angeles  california facility and the closure of our hayward  california facility 
gross profit as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries 
overall gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due primarily to higher overall profit margins for the asia pacific segment  which in turn are primarily attributable to that segment s sale of hdi pcbs and other product mix variations  partially offset by million of increased costs in the asia pacific segment due to the fair value mark up of acquired pcb subsidiaries inventory 
overall gross margin also increased due to cost savings from our closed facilities and higher fixed cost absorption on higher volumes in our north america segment 
gross profit  all of which was attributable to our north america segment  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in our gross margin was due to lower fixed cost absorption and inventory write off costs related to the closure of our redmond  washington  and los angeles  california facilities and the pending closure of our hayward  california facility 
while there was a shift in production mix towards more high technology production and higher pricing in  reduced volume across our remaining manufacturing facilities more than offset the benefit of higher pricing and contributed to a lower gross margin 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decline in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales is due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  which have lower selling labor and commission expense than our north america segment 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling and marketing expense was primarily a result of lower selling labor and commission expenses due to lower net sales and reduced costs as a result of the closure of our redmond  washington facility 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expense primarily relates to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april as well as an increase in transaction related costs of million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  
table of contents general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expense for the year ended december  primarily relates to million in transaction related costs  partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense 
amortization of definite lived intangibles intangible amortization expense increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase was due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries 
acquired identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships  trade name and order backlog 
intangible amortization expense decreased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the amortization expense primarily relates to the strategic customer relationship intangibles acquired in the pcg acquisition in october restructuring charges restructuring charges recorded for the year ended december  are primarily related to contract termination costs related to building operating leases associated with the closure of our hayward  california facility 
restructuring charges recorded for the year ended december  of million are related to separation and contract termination costs 
the separation costs in the amount of million are associated with the lay off of approximately employees  of which employees are associated with the closure of the redmond  washington and hayward and los angeles  california production facilities  and employees are related to various other us facilities during the contract termination costs of million are related to building operating leases associated with the closure of our los angeles  california manufacturing facility 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets impairment of long lived assets of million for the year ended december  related to the further reduction in the value of the dallas  oregon facility to record the estimated fair value less cost to sell given the then current market conditions 
we sold this facility in july impairment of long lived assets for the year ended december  in the amount of million was related to the closure of the redmond  washington and los angeles  california production facilities  and the then pending closure of our hayward  california facility  and consists of machinery and equipment 
additionally  during the year ended december  we reduced the value of the redmond  washington and dallas  oregon buildings  which were classified as assets held for sale  by million to record the estimated fair value less costs to sell given current market conditions 
for the year ended december  we recorded an impairment of long lived assets  including assets held for sale  of million related to our dallas  oregon  redmond  washington  and hayward  california production facilities 
our dallas  oregon facility  which was held for sale  was reduced to million in consideration of real estate market conditions  which represented its then current estimate of fair value less costs to sell 
additionally  we determined that certain long lived assets  consisting of machinery and equipment  were impaired due to slower growth and lower future production expectations for hayward  california and the january  announcement of our plans to close the redmond  washington production facility 
the redmond  washington and hayward and los angeles  california production facilities were part of our current north america operating segment 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing  and giving consideration to factors such as a weakening economy  reduced expectation for future cash flows coupled with the decline in the market price of our stock and 
table of contents market capitalization for a sustained period as indicators for potential goodwill impairment  we determined that the carrying value of our pcb manufacturing segment s goodwill exceeded its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
metal reclamation during  we recognized million of income related to a pricing reconciliation of metal reclamation activity attributable to a single vendor 
as a result of the pricing reconciliation  we discovered that the vendor had inaccurately compensated us for gold reclamation over the last several years 
while pricing reconciliations of this nature occur periodically  we do not expect to recognize a similar amount in future periods 
other income expense other expense  net increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in other expense  net was primarily due to interest expense related to the debt assumed at the date of acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  as well as increased amortization of costs related to the issuance of this debt 
for the year ended december   the increase in interest expense was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains 
other expense  net decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the overall net decrease consists of a million increase in interest expense  offset by a million decrease in other  net 
in connection with the full repayment of our credit facility in  we realized a loss on the settlement of a derivative of million  which was recognized as other  net 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher pre tax income 
our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  our effective tax rate decreased in primarily due to the acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  which have a lower effective tax rate than our north america operations  partially offset by the impact of the non deductibility of certain transaction costs 
additionally  certain foreign losses generated are not more than likely to be realizable  and thus no income tax benefit has been recognized on these losses 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the us federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  tax rates in china and hong kong  generation of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
additionally  as of december   we had net deferred income tax assets of approximately million 
based on our forecast for future taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the deferred income tax asset in future periods 
the provision for income taxes increased million from a million tax benefit for the year ended december  to a million tax provision for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was in and for the increase in the provision from was primarily due to the increase in pretax income from a loss in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  the issuance of convertible notes and  more recently  the issuance of term and revolving debt 
our principal uses of cash have been to meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures  fund working capital requirements and finance acquisitions 
we anticipate that servicing debt  funding working capital requirements  financing capital expenditures  and acquisitions will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million compared to million as of december  this decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to our use of approximately million of the million of restricted cash and the incurrence of debt including 
table of contents current maturities in connection with our april acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  partially offset by the increases in receivables and inventories resulting from that acquisition 
our capital expenditure plan is expected to total approximately million of which approximately million relates to our asia pacific segment  and will fund capital equipment purchases to increase production capacity  expand our technological capabilities and replace aging equipment 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  cash on hand and available borrowings under our existing credit arrangements will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated debt service  capital expenditures  acquisition  and working capital needs for the next months and beyond 
the semiannual repayments on our existing term loan increase as the debt nears maturity in should we choose to maintain a significant level of annual capital expenditures or to pursue an acquisition in the next few years  refinancing of our existing debt may be necessary 
in the event we determine to engage in significant acquisition or debt refinancing transactions  the adequacy of our liquidity will depend on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of financing from third parties and access to capital markets 
we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
credit agreement on april   in conjunction with the acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  the company became a party to a credit agreement credit agreement  entered into on november  by certain pcb subsidiaries  which are now our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement was put in place in contemplation of the acquisition in order to refinance the then existing credit facilities of the pcb subsidiaries 
the credit agreement consists of a million senior secured term loan  a million senior secured revolving loan  a million factoring facility  and a million letters of credit facility  all of which mature on november  the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the pcb subsidiaries and is senior to all other of our debt including the convertible senior notes 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the full and punctual payment of all obligations of the pcb subsidiaries under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate of libor term election by company plus an applicable interest margin

at december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include maintaining maximum total leverage ratios and minimum net worth  current assets  and interest coverage ratios at both the company and pcb subsidiaries level 
on august   we entered into a waiver and amendment letter with the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited  as facility agent for and on behalf of the other lenders named in the credit agreement  amending the financial covenants related to consolidated tangible net worth  gearing ratio the ratio of consolidated net borrowings to consolidated tangible net worth  and leverage 
at december   we were in compliance with the amended covenants 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on any unused portion of loan or facility under the credit agreement 
for the year ended december   we incurred million in commitment fees related to unused portion loan or facility under the credit agreement 
as of december   all of the term loan and million of letters of credit were outstanding  and available borrowing capacity under the revolving loan and factoring facility was million and million  respectively 
bank loans bank loans are made up of bank lines of credit in mainland china and are used for working capital and capital investment for our mainland china facilities 
these facilities are denominated in either us dollars or chinese renminbi rmb  with interest rates tied to either the libor or people s bank of china rates with a small margin adjustment 
these bank loans expire at various dates through may 
table of contents convertible notes in may  we issued million of convertible notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year 
the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally to our future unsecured senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness 
we received proceeds of million after the deduction of offering expenses of million 
these offering expenses are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
at any time prior to november   holders may convert their convertible notes into cash and  if applicable  into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment  under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter beginning after june  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day of such preceding calendar quarter  during the five business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that consecutive trading day period is less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the prospectus supplement related to the convertible notes  which can be found on the sec s website at www 
sec 
gov 
as of december   none of the conversion criteria had been met 
on or after november  until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day preceding the may  maturity of the convertible notes  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
upon conversion  for each  principal amount of notes  we will pay cash for the lesser of the conversion value or  and shares of our common stock  if any  based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the applicable trading day observation period 
the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion  subject to certain conversion rate adjustments  would be approximately million shares 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes at any time prior to maturity 
in the event of a fundamental change or certain default events  as defined in the prospectus supplement  holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transaction call spread transaction  with respect to our common stock 
the convertible note hedge  which cost an aggregate of million and was recorded  net of tax  as a reduction of additional paid in capital  consists of our option to purchase up to million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
this option expires on may  and can only be executed upon the conversion of the convertible notes 
additionally  we sold warrants for the option to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire ratably beginning august through february the proceeds from the sale of warrants of million was recorded as an addition to additional paid in capital 
the call spread transaction has no effect on the terms of the convertible notes and reduces potential dilution by effectively increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes to per share of our common stock 
other letters of credit in addition to the letters of credit obtained by the pcb subsidiaries pursuant to the credit agreement  we maintain several letters of credit a million standby letter of credit expiring december  associated with insured workers compensation program  a million standby letter of credit expiring february  related to the lease for one of our production facilities  and various other letters of credits aggregating to approximately million related to purchases of machinery and equipment with various expiration dates through june 
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides information on our contractual obligations as of december  less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations convertible debt obligations interest on debt obligations interest rate swap liabilities foreign currency forward contract liabilities equipment payables related party financing obligation purchase obligations operating lease commitments total contractual obligations unrecognized uncertain tax benefits of million are not included in the table above as we are not sure when the amount will be paid 
estimated environmental liabilities of million  not included in the table above  are accrued and recorded as liabilities in our consolidated december  balance sheet 
related party financing obligation consists of a put and call option agreement in which we granted a put option to a related party to sell and they granted us a call option to purchase the remaining equity interest in a recently acquired pcb subsidiary beginning in we expect the option to be exercised in off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
seasonality as a result of the product and customer mix of our asia pacific operating segment  a portion of our revenue will be subject to seasonal fluctuations going forward 
these fluctuations include seasonal patterns in the computer and cellular phone industry  which together have become a significant portion of the end markets that we serve 
this seasonality typically results in higher net sales in the third quarter due to end customer demand for fourth quarter sales of consumer electronics products 
seasonal fluctuations also include the chinese new year holiday in the first quarter  which typically results in lower net sales 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we generally will be able to continue to pass along component price increases to our customers 
severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which will require companies to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value hierarchies and information on purchases  sales  issuance and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the asu is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december   except for the new disclosures about purchases  sales  issuance and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business operations we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we have not experienced any losses to date on any derivative financial instruments due to counterparty credit risk 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
interest rate risk our business is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
our interest expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of libor and the people s bank of china interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
increases in interest rates would increase interest expenses relating to the outstanding variable rate borrowings of certain foreign subsidiaries and increase the cost of debt 
fluctuations in interest rates can also lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of the debt obligations 
on april   we entered into a two year pay fixed  receive floating month libor  amortizing interest rate swap arrangement with an initial notional amount of million  for the period beginning april  and ending on april  the interest rate swap will apply a fixed interest rate against the first interest payments of a portion of the million term loan for this period 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases to zero over its term  consistent with our risk management objectives 
the notional value underlying the hedge at december  was million 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  the company will pay a fixed rate of and will receive floating month libor during the swap period 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings as interest expense 
no ineffectiveness was recognized for the year ended december  at inception  the fair value of the interest rate swap was zero 
as of december   the fair value of the swap was recorded as a liability of million in other long term liabilities 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  in our consolidated balance sheet 
there was no impact to interest expense for the 
table of contents year ended december  as the interest rate swap does not hedge interest rate cash flows until the period beginning april  we have designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge 
we also  through our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  assumed a long term pay fixed  receive floating month libor  amortizing interest rate swap arrangement with an initial notional amount of million  for the period beginning october  and ending on july  the notional amount of the interest rate swap amortizes to zero over its term  consistent with our risk management objectives 
the notional value underlying the hedge at december  was million 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  we will pay a fixed rate of and will receive floating month libor during the swap period 
as the borrowings attributable to this interest rate swap were paid off upon acquisition  we did not designate this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge 
as of december   the fair value of the swap was recorded as a liability of million in other long term liabilities 
the change in fair value of this interest rate swap is recorded as other  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   approximately of our long term debt was based on fixed rates  including notional amounts related to interest rate swaps 
based on our borrowings as of december   an assumed change in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by million 
foreign currency risks we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar as a normal part of the reporting process 
our asia pacific operations utilize the chinese renminbi or rmb  and the hong kong dollar or hkd  as the functional currency  which results in the company recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company does not generally engage in hedging to manage foreign currency risk related to its revenue and expenses denominated in rmb and hkd 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to reduce the volatility of purchases and other obligations generated in currencies other than the functional currencies 
our foreign subsidiaries may at times purchase forward exchange contracts to manage their foreign currency risk in relation to particular purchases or obligations  such as the related party financing obligation arising from the put call option to purchase the remaining of a majority owned subsidiary in  and certain purchases of machinery denominated in foreign currencies other than our foreign functional currency 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  was approximately million 
we did not have any foreign exchange contracts as of december  we have designated certain of these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges  with the exception of the foreign exchange contracts in relation to the related party financing obligation 
in this instance  the hedged item is a recognized liability subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses and therefore  changes in the hedged item due to foreign currency exchange rates are already recorded in earnings 
therefore  hedge accounting has not been applied
