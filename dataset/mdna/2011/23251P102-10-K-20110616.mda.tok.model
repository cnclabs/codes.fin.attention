risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this item provides material historical and prospective disclosures enabling investors and other users to assess our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements and provide additional information required to fully understand the nature of amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a neuromodulation company incorporated as a delaware corporation in  engaged in the design  development and commercialization of implantable medical devices that provide a unique therapy  vagus nerve stimulation therapy vns therapy  for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and treatment resistant depression 
we sell the vns therapy system for refractory epilepsy to hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers ascs on payment terms that are generally days from the shipment date 
our ability to successfully expand the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable insurance coverage  coding and reimbursement for the vns therapy system  the associated implant procedure and follow up care 
this coverage allows our customers to invoice and be paid by third party payers 
currently  there is broad coverage  coding and reimbursement for vns therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  which we estimate pays for approximately of the vns therapy system implants  issues an annual update to the reimbursement amounts to be received by our customers 
the reimbursement rates vary depending on geographic area 
a decrease in reimbursement rates or a change in reimbursement methodology by cms could have an adverse impact on our business and our future operating results 
we are focused on expanding and enhancing our product offerings for patients with refractory epilepsy as a basis for maintaining and extending reimbursement 
this involves increased investment in research and development  specifically  seizure detection  responsive stimulation and associated technology  and likely includes additional investment in clinical studies using vns therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development  clinical studies and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
as of april   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation  or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical 
table of contents revenue recognition product revenue we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in international markets 
we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfers to customers or our independent distributors 
we maintain policies for sales returns and exchanges 
we estimate sales returns based on historical data and we record a reduction in sales and a return reserve when we sell the initial product 
the balance of our reserve for sales returns for the fiscal years ending april  and april  was million and million  respectively 
our increasing business activity  new product introductions and variations in product utilization could cause product returns to differ from our estimates 
licensing revenue we amortize upfront payments received under licensing agreements over the life of our obligations under the agreements to prosecute the licensed patent applications 
effective in december  we entered into an agreement granting an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications pertaining to weight reduction  hypertension and diabetes in exchange for an up front  non refundable payment of million  plus a royalty on future commercial sales of any product covered by the licensed patents 
we retain the responsibility to prosecute the licensed patent applications and estimate that our obligation will be satisfied by april accordingly  we have recognized revenue of approximately million per quarter based on the straight line amortization of the million payment 
however  a change in our estimate of the amortization period or a release of our obligation to prosecute the patent applications could materially change the timing of the recognition of the licensing revenue 
intellectual property the intellectual property assets as shown on our consolidated balance sheets consist of purchased exclusive and non exclusive licenses of intellectual property that we intend to use in our products 
we amortize our capitalized licenses on a straight line basis over the period beginning with the effective date of the license agreement and ending with either the expiration of the licensed patent or with the estimated end of the useful life of our product 
amortization is charged to research and development as the intended products are either in design or clinical testing 
we evaluate our intellectual property each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate a different amortization period or impairment 
if we change our estimate of the useful live of our intellectual property  we amortize the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life 
if we identify an impairment indicator  we test the intellectual property for recoverability and if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  impairment is recognized 
the weighted average amortization period for all of our intellectual property is years  however  amortization or impairment expense may materially change if  for example  we i alter our product development plans  ii alter our estimate of the useful life of a product  or iii a particular licensed technology is impaired because it does not function in our product as planned 
stock based incentive compensation our stock option grant compensation expense is based on the fair market value of our grants 
the fair market value of a grant is amortized over the grant vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing methodology to estimate the grant date fair market value of stock option grants  which takes into account variables such as grant term  expected volatility of our stock price and interest rates 
recognized compensation cost for stock option grants for the weeks ended april   the weeks ended april  and the weeks ended april  was million  million and million  respectively 
compensation expense and income tax deductions associated with stock option exercises could significantly differ from our expectations if  for example  employee turnover rates and grant forfeitures differ from our estimates or if grants expire unexercised or are exercised with minimal gains due to weak stock prices 
calculation of compensation for restricted share grants requires estimation of forfeiture rates 
different assumptions and estimates about employee turn over and cancellation of grants could significantly alter compensation expense 
recognized compensation cost for restricted share grants for the weeks ended april   the weeks ended april  and the weeks ended april  was million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents income taxes we estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves assessing the changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of events for tax and accounting purposes that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
actual tax expense may significantly differ from our expectations if  for example  judicial interpretations of tax law or tax rates change 
cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined 
we periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized 
to the extent that realization does not meet the more likely than not criterion  we establish a valuation allowance 
we periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released 
this evidence includes a profitability in the most recent fiscal years  b internal forecasts for the current and next two future fiscal years  c size of deferred tax asset relative to estimated profitability  d the potential effects on future profitability from increasing competition  healthcare reforms and overall economic conditions  e limitations and potential limitations on the use of our net operating losses due to ownership changes  pursuant to internal revenue code irc section  and f the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  if any 
projecting future taxable income requires significant judgment about the trend and nature of our sales and operating expenses  which include an evaluation of the potential effects of new markets  changing technology  patent protection  governmental and private insurance reimbursement trends and regulatory trends 
changes in our assessment of the factors related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in materially different income tax provisions 
during the quarter ended october   based on our evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we reduced our valuation allowance by million  of which million was recorded as a tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income and million was recorded as a benefit in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet 
during the quarter ended october   based on our evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we reduced our valuation allowance by million 
this reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as a tax benefit in our consolidated statement of income 
at april  we had a valuation allowance of million  against the net operating losses from our foreign operations and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
the net operating losses for the excess tax benefits from stock based awards are deemed more likely than not to be realized  however  the associated valuation allowance will not be released until the benefit is used to reduce income taxes payable 
the benefit will be recorded in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet 
our foreignnet operating losses are not likely to be realized and consequently the associated valuation allowance has not been released 
we operate in europe with a subsidiary  cyberonics europe  bvba sprl cyberonics europe  bvba 
cyberonics europe  bvba  based in belgium  is the successor organization arising from the restructuring of cyberonics  nv sa  which was also based in belgium 
we made an election to treat cyberonics europe  bvba as a disregarded entity for us federal tax purposes in the quarter ended october  in conjunction with this transaction  we recognized as a discrete event  a net million income tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of the losses realized by cyberonics europe  bvba 
the internal revenue service irs could challenge the characterization of this type of transaction 
the resolution of any challenge could result in reversal of all  part or none of the benefit recorded during the quarter ended october  consequently  we have estimated and recorded a million liability for uncertain tax benefits which increased our income tax provision 
changes in our assessment of the factors related to sustainability of this deduction would have resulted in a materially different income tax provision 

table of contents results of operations we had one extra week in the fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal years ended april  and april  net sales the table below illustrates comparative net product revenue and unit sales by geographic area and our licensing revenues

us net product sales for the weeks ended april  increased by million  or  as compared to the weeks ended april   due to a sales volume increase of and increased average selling prices of 
the average selling price increased due to continued higher market penetration of our demipulse generators and our perennia leads  and  beginning in the february  the first sales of our aspirehc generators 
in addition  average selling price increased due to a price increase of approximately for leads and generators in january  and price increases in january of for the demipulse generators  for the older pulse generators and for leads 
international net product sales for the weeks ended april  decreased by million  or  as compared to the weeks ended april   due to a sales volume decrease of and a decreased average selling price of 
sales volume decreased due to lower sales in key european countries partially offset by increased sales in japan and partially due to the extra week in the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year the average selling prices decreased due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of and a higher proportion of sales to distributors 
sales to distributors are generally at lower prices than sales through our own employees 
us net product sales for the weeks ended april  increased by million  or  as compared to the weeks ended april   due to a sales volume increase of and increased average selling prices of 
the volume increase was partially due to the extra week in the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year the average selling price increased  in part  due to higher market penetration of our demipulse generators and price increases in january international net product sales for the weeks ended april  increased by million  or  as compared to the weeks ended april   due to a sales volume increase of  offset by a decrease in the average selling prices of

our cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the weeks ended april  decreased percentage points to when compared to the weeks ended april  our cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the weeks ended april  decreased percentage points to when compared to the weeks ended april  these decreases were primarily a result of improved efficiencies due to higher production volumes and a reduction in stock based compensation 
we paid royalty fees  a part of cost of sales  of million  for the year ended april  these fees are paid under the terms of a licensing agreement that provides us with worldwide exclusive rights under five us patents and their international counterparts covering the method and devices of the vns therapy system for vagus nerve stimulation 
the fees amounted to of our cost of sales for the year ended april   and we expect that these fees will terminate  in accordance with the agreement  when the epilepsy patent expires on july  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses consist of sales  marketing  general and administrative activities 
sg a expenses for the weeks ended april   as a percent of net sales  decreased by percentage points to  as compared to the weeks ended april  this decrease was primarily a result of lower stock based compensation  which decreased as a percent of net sales  and lower international sg a expenses  which decreased as a percent of net sales 
these expenses are expected to increase in fiscal year sg a expenses for the weeks ended april   as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points to  as compared to the weeks ended april  this decrease was primarily a result of lower stock based compensation and the result of revenue growth rates in excess of sg a growth rates 
research and development r d expenses r d expenses consist of expenses related to our product and process development  product design efforts  clinical trial programs and regulatory activities 
r d expenses for the weeks ended april  increased  as a percentage of sales  by percentage points to as compared to the weeks ended april  this increase was primarily due to an increase in our product development efforts with respect to the treatment of refractory epilepsy and increased clinical expenses related to our clinical development program 
our product development efforts continue to focus on the development of products and enhancements related to rechargeable and wireless technology  seizure detection and recording technology  as well as remote monitoring and telemedicine enhancements 
our clinical development program continues to focus on the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a device that employs cardiac based seizure detection and delivers responsive vns therapy 
r d expenses for the weeks ended april  decreased  as a percentage of sales  by percentage points to as compared to the weeks ended april  this decrease was primarily due to our decreased clinical spending for the dosing study and the result of revenue growth rate exceeding the growth rate of our product development activity 

table of contents interest income interest income for the weeks ended april  was  as compared to interest income of  for the weeks ended april  and  for the weeks ended april  interest income reported in fiscal year was primarily the result of accruing interest income on our investments in the convertible debt securities of our collaborative partners and additional yield on our cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income reported in fiscal year and fiscal year was the yield of our cash and cash equivalent balances 
the increase in interest income in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to our investments in convertible debt securities 
the decease in interest income in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to falling interest rates 
interest expense our interest expense was primarily a result of our senior subordinated convertible notes  the convertible notes that we issued in september for million at the rate of per year on the principal amount 
see note convertible notes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further description of the convertible notes 
interest expense was million for the weeks ended april   as compared to interest expense of million for the weeks ended april  and million for the weeks ended april  these decreases were due to the decline in the average outstanding balance of our convertible notes during the respective periods resulting from our repurchases of our convertible notes 
gain on early extinguishment of debt gains on the early extinguishment of debt are due to the repurchase of our convertible notes 
see note convertible notes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further description of the convertible notes 
we had gains of million for the weeks ended april  as compared to gains of million for the weeks ended april  and gains of million for the weeks ended april  these decreases in the gains are due to decreased repurchases and an increase in the cost of repurchasing our debt 
the cost of repurchasing our debt is increased due to our improved consolidated financial condition 
other expense  net other expense  net consists of the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the results of our foreign currency derivative activities 
other expense  net for the weeks ended april  was  which consisted of losses on our foreign currency derivative contracts of  offset by net foreign currency transaction gains associated primarily with the effects of a weakening us dollar as compared to the euro 
other expense  net of  for the weeks ended april  and  for the weeks ended april  consisted of net foreign currency transaction losses primarily associated with the effect of a strengthening us dollar as compared to the euro 
in fiscal years and we did not enter into foreign currency derivative contracts 
income taxes we estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves assessing the changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of events for tax and accounting purposes that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense compared to pre tax income yields an effective tax rate 
we provide for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 
in the event that our actual results differ from our estimates  we may adjust our effective tax rate in future periods 
cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined 

table of contents we periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized 
to the extent that realization does not meet the more likely than not criterion  we establish a valuation allowance 
we periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released 
this evidence includes a profitability in the most recent fiscal years  b internal forecasts for the current and next two future fiscal years  c size of deferred tax asset relative to estimated profitability  d the potential effects on future profitability from increasing competition  healthcare reforms and overall economic conditions  e limitations and potential limitations on the use of our net operating losses due to ownership changes  pursuant to irc section  and f the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  if any 
projecting future taxable income requires significant judgment about the trend and nature of our sales and operating expenses  which include an evaluation of the potential effects of new markets  changing technology  patent protection  governmental and private insurance reimbursement trends and regulatory trends 
our estimates of factors relevant to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
during the quarter ended october   we evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets using the criteria described above and  as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance by million 
this reduction in the valuation allowance was a discrete event and million was recorded as a tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income and million was recorded as a benefit in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet in the quarter ended october  prior to the quarter ended october   all of our deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance 
during the quarter ended october   we evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  as a result  reduced our related valuation allowance by million 
this reduction in the valuation allowance was a discrete event and was recorded as a tax benefit in our consolidated statement of income in the quarter ended october  at april  we had a valuation allowance of million  against the net operating losses from our foreign operations and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
the net operating losses for the excess tax benefits from stock based awards are deemed more likely than not to be realized  however  the associated valuation allowance will not be released until the benefit is used to reduce income taxes payable 
the benefit will be recorded in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet 
our foreign net operating losses are not likely to be realized and consequently the associated valuation allowance has not been released 
we operate in europe with a subsidiary  cyberonics europe  bvba sprl cyberonics europe  bvba 
cyberonics europe  bvba  based in belgium  is the successor organization arising from the restructuring of cyberonics  nv sa  which was also based in belgium 
we made a check the box election to treat cyberonics  europe  bvba as a disregarded entity for us federal tax purposes in the quarter ended october  in conjunction with this transaction  we recognized as a discrete event  a net million income tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of the losses realized by cyberonics europe  bvba 
the irs could challenge the characterization of this type of transaction 
the resolution of any challenge could result in reversal of all  part or none of the benefit recorded during the quarter ended october  consequently  we have recorded a million liability for uncertain tax benefits  classified as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of april  our effective tax rate for fiscal year is approximately including the impact of discrete events and state and foreign income taxes 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal years and will be approximately 
fluctuations will be due primarily to the potential impact of shortfalls resulting from stock option exercises or cancellations and restricted stock vesting 
shortfalls are driven by the stock price on the date of grant  the market price on the exercise date for stock options  the vesting date for restricted shares  the number of shares transacted and the number of shares expired or cancelled 
therefore  future shortfalls and our effective tax rate may vary significantly 
our cash payments for income taxes for fiscal year were approximately of income before tax 
we estimate similar tax payments for fiscal years and

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million to million during the weeks ended april   as compared to a decrease of million to million during the weeks ended april   and a decrease of million to million during the weeks ended april  the reasons for the changes in our cash and cash equivalents balances are discussed below 

table of contents cash flows cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities and the net increase decrease in the balance of cash and cash equivalents were as follows weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended april  april  april  operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease operating activities cash provided by operating activities during the weeks ended april  increased by million to million as compared to the weeks ended april  this increased operating cash flow was primarily due to increased gross profit margin of million  partially offset by increased operating expenses of million and increased net operating assets of million 
net operating assets increased primarily because trade accounts receivable increased million  payroll accruals decreased million and inventory increased million 
trade accounts receivables and inventories both increased due to increasing sales in the us partially offset by decreasing sales in the european operations 
payroll accruals decreased primarily due to decreased annual non sales compensation expense 
cash provided by operating activities during the weeks ended april  increased million as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to a million increase in income from operations 
during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  we experienced an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to an increase in payroll and other compensation caused by i a change in the timing of bonus payments to annual from semi annual ii higher sales  and iii the timing of the final payday in the fiscal year 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during the weeks ended april  increased by million to million as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to increased investment in the acquisition of intellectual property for use in our research and development projects and increased investment  for research and development purposes  in the convertible debt securities of collaborative third parties 
cash used in investing activities during the weeks ended april  increased by million  as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to increased investment for business infrastructure  research capabilities and acquisition of intellectual property from third parties 
financing activities cash used in financing activities during the weeks ended april  decreased by million as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to decreased repurchases of our convertible notes of million 
during the fiscal year the increase in our repurchases of treasury stock was largely offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises 
cash used in financing activities during the weeks ended april  decreased by million as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to decreased repurchases of our convertible notes  partially offset by a decrease in cash proceeds from exercise of options for common stock 

table of contents debt instruments and contractual obligations convertible notes during the weeks ended april   the weeks ended april  and the weeks ended april   we repurchased million  million and million  respectively  of aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions 
the balance of our outstanding convertible notes at april  was million 
contractual obligations a summary of contractual obligations as of april  are as follows less than one year one to three years four to five years over five years total contractual obligations contractual obligations related to off balance sheet arrangements operating leases inventory purchases interest on notes issuance other contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet convertible notes total reflects operating lease obligations related to facilities  office equipment and automobiles 
reflects certain of our inventory purchase commitments that are material  legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected manufacturing requirements and are in the normal course of business 
reflects interest expected to be paid in fiscal year  through december   related to the convertible notes issuance in accordance with the supplemental indenture 
reflects certain purchase contracts that are legally binding and specify minimum purchase amounts primarily in connection with sales  marketing and training events and an information technology service agreement 
also included are expected future payments for services under cancellable contracts for clinical research 
in addition  we included expected future payments to our license and technology collaborative partners under cancellable contracts for i licensing fees  ii minimum royalty payments  and iii minimum consulting fees  through december reflects principal and interest obligations currently reported on the consolidated balance sheet related to the convertible notes issuance presented as if the convertible notes were to become due and payable on december   in accordance with the supplemental indenture 
the table above does not reflect the gross unrecognized tax benefits of million  due to our inability to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the payments 
for additional discussion on our uncertain tax position see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we believe our current liquidity and capital resources will be adequate to fund anticipated business activities through the end of fiscal year our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results  including those referred to in item a 
risk factors above 

table of contents factors affecting future operating results and common stock price the factors affecting our future operating results and common stock prices are disclosed in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents 
we do not hedge our interest rate exposure 
the effect on net income for the weeks ended april  of a basis point increase in short term interest rates would have been favorable by approximately  or 
conversely  any decrease in short term interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated results of income for the weeks ended april  foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings  particularly with respect to the us dollar versus the euro and great britain pound 
starting in the second quarter of the current fiscal year  we entered into foreign currency forward derivative contracts with a major international bank to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we choose not to offset certain other foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to immateriality  accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of offsetting particular exposures 
there can be no assurance that our derivative policy will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  and without consideration of our use of offsetting derivative contracts  a sensitivity analysis indicates that if the us dollar uniformly weakened against the euro and the great britain pound the effect on net income after tax  for the weeks ended april   would have been favorable by approximately  or 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened against the euro and the great britain pound the impact on net income after tax  for the weeks ended april   would have been unfavorable by approximately  or
