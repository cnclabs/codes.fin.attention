item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  included in part iv item a financial statements  of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended february  the report or k 
forward looking statements portions of this report may contain forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections 
such statements  including statements relating to the company s expectations for future financial performance  are not considered historical facts and are considered forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
words such as believe  expect  anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
risks and uncertainties may cause the company s actual future results to be materially different from those discussed in forward looking statements 
the company s risks and uncertainties include the timely development and market acceptance of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the company s ability to procure capacity from suppliers and the timely performance of their obligations  commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange  potential investment losses as a result of market liquidity conditions  the effects of changing economic and political conditions in the market domestically and internationally and on its customers  relationships with and dependence on customers and growth rates in the personal computer  consumer electronics and embedded and automotive markets and within the company s sales channel  changes in customer order patterns  including order cancellations or reduced bookings  the effects of tariff  import and currency regulation  potential or actual litigation  and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation  among others 
in addition  smsc competes in the semiconductor industry  which has historically been characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  price erosion and periods of mismatched supply and demand 

table of contents the company s forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations and may not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions  mergers or divestitures 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and are based upon the information available to smsc at this time 
such statements are subject to change  and the company does not undertake to update such statements  except to the extent required under applicable law and regulation 
these and other risks and uncertainties  including potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation  are detailed from time to time in the company s periodic and current reports as filed with the sec 
readers are advised to review other sections of this report  including part i item a risk factors  for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties 
other cautionary statements and risks and uncertainties may also appear elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and sec rules and regulations requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of sales and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
smsc believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual future results may differ from these estimates  and to the extent that such differences are material  future reported operating results may be affected 
revenue recognition sales and associated gross profit from shipments to the company s distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are deferred until the distributors resell the products 
shipments to distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are made under agreements allowing price protection and limited rights to return unsold merchandise 
in addition  smsc s shipments to its distributors may be subject from time to time to short term fluctuations as distributors manage their inventories to current levels of end user demand 
therefore  smsc considers the policy of deferring revenue on shipments to distributors to be a more meaningful presentation of the company s operating results  as reported sales are more representative of end user demand 
this policy is a common practice within the semiconductor industry 
the company s revenue recognition is therefore highly dependent upon receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from its distributors 
distributors routinely provide the company with product  price  quantity and end customer data when products are resold  as well as periodic inventory data 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  the company uses this data in reconciling any differences between the distributors reported inventories and shipment activities 
although this information is reviewed and verified for accuracy  any errors or omissions made by the company s distributors and not detected by the company  if material  could affect reported operating results 
shipments made by the company s japanese subsidiary to distributors in japan are made under agreements that permit limited or no stock return or price protection privileges 
smsc recognizes revenue from product sales to distributors in japan  and to original equipment manufacturers oems  as title passes upon delivery  net of appropriate reserves for product returns and allowances 
inventories the company s inventories are comprised of complex  high technology products that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  and are reviewed at least quarterly for product obsolescence  excess balances and other indications of impairment in value  based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
when it is determined that specific inventory is stated at a higher value than that which can be recovered  the company writes this inventory down to its estimated realizable value with a charge to costs of goods sold 
while the company endeavors to appropriately forecast customer demand and stock commensurate levels of inventory  unanticipated inventory write downs may be required in future periods relating to inventory on hand as of any reported balance sheet date 

table of contents fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued a new standard for fair value measurement now codified as asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining fair value  management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact  and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions  and risk of non performance 
in january  the fasb issued new standards in the fasb accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which require new disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements 
the standards also require disclosure of activities  including purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements within the level fair value measurements 
the standards also clarify existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures regarding level and fair value measurements and clarification of existing disclosures were adopted by smsc beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value 
the company s non financial assets including goodwill  intangible assets  and  property  plant and equipment are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized 
this pronouncement requires disclosure regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three tiered value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities are grouped  based upon significant levels of inputs as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs  other than level prices  such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
this includes certain pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs 
the lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy 
stock based compensation the company has several stock based compensation plans in effect under which incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  restricted stock awards rsas  restricted stock units rsus  employee stock purchase plan shares and stock appreciation rights sars have been granted to employees and directors 
stock options and sars are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
new shares of common stock are issued in settling stock option exercises and restricted stock awards 
the black scholes option pricing model is used for estimating the fair value of options and sars granted and corresponding compensation expense to be recognized 
the black scholes model requires certain assumptions  judgments and estimates by the company to determine fair value  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term 
the company based the expected volatility on historical volatility 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the expected term of each individual sars award is assumed to be the midpoint of the remaining term through expiration as of any remeasurement date 
prior to that  the company based expected term of sars on an actuarial model 
share based compensation amounts related to rsas and rsus are calculated based on the market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
there were no dividends expected to be paid on the company s common stock over the expected lives estimated 

table of contents business combinations the company accounts for business combinations under the purchase method and allocates total purchase price for acquired businesses to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
the fair values assigned to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management estimates and assumptions that utilize established valuation techniques appropriate for the semiconductor industry and each acquired business consistent with market participant assumptions 
a liability for contingent consideration  if applicable  is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in determining the fair value of such contingent consideration  management estimates the amount to be paid based on probable outcomes and expectations of financial performance of the related acquired business 
the fair value of contingent consideration is reassessed quarterly  with any change in expected value charged to results of operations 
investments in equity securities investments in equity securities representing less than a controlling interest are carried at cost  unless facts and circumstances indicate that either i the company has significant influence over the operations of the investment and therefore accounts for the investment under the equity method or ii consolidation of the related business is warranted  as may be the case if such were deemed to be a variable interest entity 
the cost of such investments is reflected in the investments in equity securities caption of the company consolidated balance sheets  and are periodically reviewed for indications of impairment in value 
the cost basis of any investment for which potential indications of impairment exist that were deemed other than temporary would be reduced accordingly  with a charge to results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimated losses are based upon historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company regularly performs credit evaluations consisting primarily of reviews of its customers financial condition  using information provided by the customers as well as publicly available information  if any 
if the financial condition of an individual customer or group of customers deteriorates  resulting in such customers inability to make payments within approved credit terms  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and definite lived intangible assets  are monitored and reviewed for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimated cash flows are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to factors such as technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the company s business model or operating performance 
if at the time of such evaluation the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is below the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by market participant assumptions 
indefinite lived intangible assets are also reviewed annually for potential impairment 
as of february   the company had million of trademarks associated with its automotive reporting unit and million of trade names associated with its wireless audio reporting unit which were evaluated and deemed recoverable as part of the assessment of related goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company lost its primary customer in its storage solutions business 
as a result  the company initiated a plan to reduce costs and investments in this business 
in connection with this action  the company incurred an impairment loss of million  primarily for certain indefinite lived purchased technologies acquired as part of this business 

table of contents goodwill is tested for impairment in value annually  as well as when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment in value 
the company performs an annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value 
for purposes of asc testing  the company has three reporting units the automotive reporting unit  the wireless audio reporting unit and the analog mixed signal reporting unit 
the company considered both the market and income approaches in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units  specifically the market multiple methodology and discounted cash flow methodology 
the market multiple methodology involved the utilization of various revenue and cash flow measures at appropriate risk adjusted multiples 
multiples were determined through an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that were selected on the basis of operational and economic similarity with the business operations 
provided these companies meet these criteria  they can be considered comparable from an investment standpoint even if the exact business operations and or characteristics of the entities are not the same 
revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation andamortization ebitda multiples were calculated for the comparable companies based on market data and published financial reports 
a comparative analysis between the company and the public companies deemed to be comparable formed the basis for the selection of appropriate risk adjusted multiples for the company 
the comparative analysis incorporates both quantitative and qualitative risk factors which relate to  among other things  the nature of the industry in which the company and other comparable companies are engaged 
in the discounted cash flow methodology  long term projections prepared by the company were utilized 
the cash flows projected were analyzed on a debt free basis before cash payments to equity and interest bearing debt investors in order to develop an enterprise value 
a provision  based on these projections  for the value of the company at the end of the forecast period  or terminal value  was also made 
the present value of the cash flows and the terminal value were determined using a risk adjusted rate of return  or discount rate 
upon completion of the fiscal and assessment  it was determined that the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value  therefore no impairment in value was identified 
in fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge of million relating to its automotive reporting unit  comprised principally of the portions of the business relating to the oasis acquisition 
the primary factors contributing to this impairment charge were the economic downturn  which caused a decline in the automotive market  an increase in the implied discount rate due to higher risk premiums  and  the decline in the company s market capitalization 
refer to part iv item a i financial statements note for additional information on the computation of the goodwill impairment charge 
income taxes accounting for income tax obligations requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax effects of differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities as well as tax attributes such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets resulting from these differences must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its taxable temporary differences  its historical results  its forecasts of future taxable income and reviewing available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
at february   the company had million of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance of million and million of deferred tax liabilities 
the company s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets and the continuing need for related valuation allowances are monitored on an ongoing basis 
the company applies asc in the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its financial statements 
asc requires that all tax positions be evaluated using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable  or adjustments to deferred taxes  or both 
the company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretation of tax law 
to the extent that new information becomes available which causes the company to change its judgment about the adequacy of its accruals for uncertain tax positions  such changes will impact income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

table of contents legal contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these contingencies require management to assess the likelihood and possible cost of adverse judgments or outcomes 
liabilities for legal contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
there can be no assurance that any third party assertions against the company will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may subject the company to royalty obligations  product redesigns or discontinuance of products  any of which could adversely impact future profitability 
recent accounting standards in october the financial accounting standards board fasb the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu and asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu modifies the requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  or ii third party evidence  or tpe  before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
for smsc  these new updates are required to be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption available 
the company adopted these asus retroactively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of these asus did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new standards in the fasb accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which require new disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements 
the standards also require disclosure of activities  including purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements within the level fair value measurements 
the standards also clarify existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures regarding level and fair value measurements and clarification of existing disclosures were adopted by smsc beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of asc did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

sts is a fabless designer of plug and play wireless solutions for consumer audio streaming applications providing a robust  low latency low power digital audio baseband processor and integrated module solutions which are highly complementary to smsc kleer wireless audio products 
gross profit and operating income benefited from the rise in sales and revenue by leveraging production overhead and fixed costs  this was partially offset by stock compensation expense increases 
restructuring actions taken in the first quarter of fiscal to lower supply chain costs also contributed to the gross profit improvement 
operating income also improved due to an acquisition termination fee gain and income related to the revaluation of contingent consideration of certain acquisitions 
in addition  the company announced restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce its investment in storage solutions and converge wireless technology roadmaps associated with the sts and kleer acquisitions 
these actions resulted in impairments and write downs of certain long lived assets acquired in the symwave acquisition as well as severance costs 
the company s stock compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the common stock market price 
while all of the company s stock based compensation instruments are affected by market price changes  the company s stock appreciation rights sars have the most significant impact on the results of operations because as liability based awards they are marked to market each reporting period with the resulting change in value charged to operating income

auction rate securities as of february   the company held approximately million in auction rates securities net of million in gross unrealized losses  as more fully described in part iv item a financial statements note auction rate securities are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that were  until february  reset through a dutch auction process 
as of february   percent of the company s auction rate securities were aaa rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies  mainly collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us department of education under the federal family education loan program ffelp  as well as auction rate preferred securities million at par which are aaa rated and part of a closed end fund that must maintain an asset ratio of to historically  the carrying value par value of the auction rate securities approximated fair market value due to the frequent resetting of variable interest rates 
beginning in february  however  the auctions for auction rate securities began to fail and were largely unsuccessful 
as a result  the interest rates on the investments reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements 
the types of auction rate securities generally held by the company had historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer 
the par invested principal value of the auction rate securities associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible to the company until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the securities are called or the underlying securities have matured 
in light of these liquidity constraints and the lack of market based data  the company performed a valuation analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these investments 
the fair value of these investments is based on a trinomial discount model 
this model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of the security 
the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auction early redemption  ii failed auction and iii issuer default 
inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include  but are not limited to  the security s collateral  credit rating  insurance  issuer s financial standing  contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market 
the fair value of each security is determined by summing the present value of the probability weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for successful auctions within the aaa rated auction rate securities market 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
the illiquidity discount was based on the levels of federal insurance or ffelp backing for each security as well as considering similar preferred stock securities ratings and asset backed ratio requirements for each security 

table of contents as a result  as of february   the company recorded an estimated cumulative unrealized loss of million related to the temporary impairment of the auction rate securities  which was included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
the company deemed the loss to be temporary because the company does not plan to sell any of the auction rate securities prior to maturity at an amount below the original purchase value and  at this time  does not deem it probable that it will receive less than percent of the principal and accrued interest from the issuer 
further  the auction rate securities held by the company are aaa rated 
the company continues to liquidate investments in auction rate securities as opportunities arise 
in fiscal and  million and million in auction rate securities were liquidated at par in connection with issuer calls  respectively 
given its sufficient cash reserves and positive cash flow from operations  the company does not believe it will be necessary to access these investments to support current working capital requirements 
however  the company may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in future periods based on then current facts and circumstances 
further  if the credit rating of the security issuers deteriorates  or if active markets for such securities are not reestablished  the company may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through impairment charges recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations  and any such impairment adjustments may be material 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations and purchase commitments as of february  were as follows in thousands payment obligations by period total within year between and years between and years thereafter operating leases other obligations inventory and other purchase commitments contingent consideration on acquisitions total other obligations include accrued officers and directors retirement obligations and supplier financing obligations 
inventory and other purchase obligations include purchase commitments for processed silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
the company depends entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture its silicon wafers and provide assembly services  as well as for certain of its test services 
due to the length of subcontractor lead times  the company orders these materials and services well in advance  and generally expects to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
for purposes of the preceding table  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the company cannot cancel these obligations without incurring cost 
non cancelable purchase orders for manufacturing requirements are typically fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons  generally three months or less 
the company has additional purchase orders  not included within the table  that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the company recorded a liability for contingent consideration as part of the purchase price for the acquisitions of symwave  sts  kleer and kl 
the company performs a quarterly revaluation of contingent consideration and records the change as a component of operating income 
due to reductions in estimated future operating results of symwave  sts and kleer  the company expects to make no contingent consideration payments related to these acquisitions 
the remaining liability for contingent consideration is for kl  for which million euro was earned for calendar year and another million euro can be earned for calendar year on march   million euro in cash and stock was paid to the former owners of kl for calendar year performance targets 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of february   the company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and investment liquidity risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its investment portfolio ie with respect to interest income 
the primary objective of smsc s investment portfolio management is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  investments are placed with high credit quality issuers and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer is limited 
as of february   the company s million of long term investments consisted primarily of investments in us government agency backed aaa rated auction rate securities 
from time to time  the company has also held investments in corporate  government and municipal obligations with maturities of between three and twelve months at acquisition 
auction rate securities have long term underlying maturities  but have interest rates that until recently had been reset every days or less at auction  at which time the securities could also typically be repurchased or sold 
in february  the company began to experience failed auctions on some of its auction rate securities 
based on the failure rate of these auctions  the frequency and extent of the failures  and due to the lack of liquidity in the current market for the auction rate securities  the company determined that the estimated fair value of the auction rate securities no longer approximates par value 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of these investments as of february   and recorded an unrealized loss of million  net of tax related to the temporary impairment of the auction rate securities  which was included in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
assuming all other assumptions disclosed in part iv item a financial statements note of this report  being equal  an increase or decrease in the liquidity risk premium ie the discount rate of basis points as used in the model would decrease or increase  respectively  the fair value of the auction rate securities by approximately million 
in addition  an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points would decrease interest income of million to a negligible amount or increase interest income by million 
equity price risk the company is not exposed to any significant equity price risks at february  foreign currency risk the company has international operations and is therefore subject to certain foreign currency rate exposures  principally the euro and japanese yen 
the company also conducts a significant amount of its business in asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  most of the company s product sales and all of its arrangements with its foundry  test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
the company s most significant foreign subsidiaries  smsc japan and smsc europe  purchase a significant amount of their products for resale in us dollars  and from time to time have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations associated with these product purchases 
gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the gains or losses recorded for statutory and us gaap purposes from the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities from us dollars into local currencies 
no such contracts were executed during fiscal  and there are no obligations under any such contracts as of february  however  the company has purchased currencies from time to time throughout the current fiscal year in anticipation of more significant foreign currency transactions  in order to optimize effective rates associated with those settlements 

table of contents operating activities in europe include transactions conducted in both euros and us dollars 
the euro has been designated as smsc europe s functional currency for its european operations 
losses recorded from the remeasurement of us dollar denominated assets and liabilities into euros were million in fiscal  compared with losses of million in fiscal losses recorded from the remeasurement of us dollar denominated assets and liabilities into yen for fiscal were million compared with a loss of million in fiscal commodity price risk the company routinely uses precious metals in the manufacturing of its products 
supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted  or general market factors and conditions may affect pricing of such commodities 
in the latter part of fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter  and in fiscal  the price of gold increased precipitously  and certain of our supply chain partners began and continue to assess surcharges to compensate for the resultant increase in manufacturing costs 
the company is engaged in a project to replace gold with copper in certain of its parts to reduce this exposure 
while the company continues to attempt to mitigate the risk of similar increases in commodities related costs  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully safeguard against potential short term and long term commodities price fluctuations
