item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein 
we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit 
we own  operate  and develop manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states 
as of december   we owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in states  including manufactured housing communities  recreational vehicle communities  and properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites 
the majority of our revenue income from real property is affected by occupancy and our ability to raise rents 
our residents normally sign a one year lease and then lease on a month to month basis for the next ten to fifteen years 
few of our leases are tied to published cpi statistics or other indices therefore allowing us significant flexibility in rental increases based on the markets in which we operate 
weighted average rent increases over the last five years have ranged from percent to percent and we expect to continue to be able to increase rents at or near these levels in the future 
our rental program  established during the significant downturn in our industry during the early to mid s  has become a significant contributor to the stability and improvement of our occupancies and revenue stream 
over the past several years  the rental program has been the single largest contributor to the generation of applications to live in our communities  which numbered nearly  in we own and rent approximately  homes throughout our portfolio applying stringent approval standards over of our rental applications are denied to each applicant thereby ensuring maintenance of the quality of our communities as desirable neighborhoods in which to live 
during  occupants in the rental program increased by home sales units sold have increased from  in to  in and we anticipate selling approximately  homes in the coming year 
our ability to sell homes is dependent on access to financing for the prospective buyer 
although the majority of our home sales are financed through third party lenders  we do provide financing for certain home purchasers who are unable to obtain financing through other means 
the economic downturns and market volatility during the past few years have presented both challenges and opportunities 
we provide affordable housing to the marketplace which  in difficult times  requires the housing values that our products and programs offer 
this demand is somewhat offset by job losses in our resident base resulting from businesses closing and layoffs which occur in times of economic contraction 
the broader financial markets which provide capital for funding our continued growth and refinancing of debt are improving  but remain constrained and contain terms more restrictive than when most of our current debt was originated 
we are focused on financing opportunities which will allow us to replace our million unsecured revolving line of credit and million of secured debt  both of which come due in critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimate and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment property investment property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in the anticipated market price  an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long lived asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when a long lived asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets based on future cash flows and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset 
forecasting cash flows requires management to make estimates and assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period  rental rates  occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period  as well as disposition proceeds 
management uses its best judgment when developing these estimates and assumptions  but the development of the projected future cash flows is based on subjective variables 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist  and significant adverse changes in national  regional  or local market conditions or trends may cause us to change the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
the results of an impairment analysis could be material to our financial statements 
investment in affiliates investments in affiliates in which we do not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest  but can exercise significant influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the carrying value of our investment is adjusted for our proportionate share of the affiliate s net income or loss and reduced by distributions received 
we review the carrying value of our investment in affiliates for other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
financial condition  operational performance  and other economic trends are some of the factors we consider when we evaluate the existence of impairment indicators 
notes and accounts receivable we evaluate the recoverability of our receivables whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan and lease agreements 
receivables related to community rents are reserved when we believe that collection is less than probable  which is generally after a resident balance reaches to days past due 
the ability to collect our notes receivable is measured based on current and historical information and events 
we consider numerous factors including length of delinquency  estimated costs to lease or sell  and repossession history 
we reserve for estimated unrecoverable costs associated with our notes receivables 
we estimate our unrecoverable costs to be the repurchase price plus repair and remarketing costs that exceed the estimated selling price of the home being repossessed 
a historical average of this excess cost is calculated based on prior repossessions and applied to our estimated annual future repossessions to create the allowance for our notes receivable 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are years for land improvements and buildings  years for rental homes  to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment  and years for intangible assets 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to site and home leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants generally range from month to month to two years and are renewable by mutual agreement from us and the resident  or in some cases  as provided by state statute 
revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction 
interest income on notes receivable is recorded on a level yield basis over the life of the notes 
we report certain taxes collected from the resident and remitted to taxing authorities in revenue 
these taxes include certain florida property and fire taxes 
capitalized costs we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of our properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
costs incurred to renovate repossessed homes for our rental program are capitalized and costs incurred to refurbish the homes at turnover and repair the homes while occupied are expensed 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period based on the anticipated term of occupancy of a resident 
costs associated with implementing our computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we have four derivative contracts consisting of three interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million  and an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million as of december  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we adjust our balance sheet on a quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of our derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings or comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the effective portion of the hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we use standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the code 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if we distribute at least ninety percent of its reit ordinary taxable income to our stockholders  which we fully intends to do 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we remain subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
we are subject to certain state taxes that are considered income taxes and have certain subsidiaries that are taxed as regular corporations 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  asu which amends asc topic  receivables  which will require significant new disclosures about the allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of an entity s financing receivables 
the requirements are intended to enhance transparency regarding credit losses and the credit quality of financing receivables by disclosing an evaluation of i the nature of credit risk inherent in the entity s portfolio of financing receivables  ii how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses and iii the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses 
the new and amended disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  upon review of the requirements for the disclosure in asu  we are not required to disclose any additional information since our receivables are presented at fair value 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is included in asc topic  transfers and servicing 
the updated guidance in asc topic removes the concept of a qspe and eliminates the exception for qspes from consolidation guidance 
in addition  it also established specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
if the transfer does not meet established sale conditions  sale accounting can be achieved only if the transferor transfers an entire financial asset or a group of entire financial assets and surrenders control over the entire transferred asset s 
the updated guidance in asc topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of the updated guidance within asc topic did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which is included in asc topic  consolidation 
the updated guidance in asc topic requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics  among others a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity  or the right to receive benefits from the entity  that could potentially be significant to the vie 
under the updated guidance in asc topic  ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie are required 
the updated guidance in asc topic is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  the adoption of the updated guidance within asc topic did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
supplemental measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with gaap  we have provided information regarding net operating income noi in the following tables 
noi is derived from revenues minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
we use noi as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of our operations 
a reconciliation of noi to net income loss attributable to sun communities  inc is included in results of operations below 
we believe that noi is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time 
we use noi as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and or groups of properties 
the principal limitation of noi is that it excludes depreciation  amortization  interest expense  and non property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses  all of which are significant costs  and therefore  noi is a measure of the operating performance of our properties rather than of the company overall 
we believe that these costs included in net income loss often have no effect on the market value of our property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure 
in addition  such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset 
noi should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our financial performance  or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
noi  as determined and presented by us  may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we also provide information regarding funds from operations ffo 
we consider ffo an appropriate supplemental measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
under the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  ffo represents net income  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap  and gain loss on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management also uses an adjusted funds from operations adjusted ffo non gaap financial measure  which excludes certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business 
we believe that adjusted ffo provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable when evaluating period over period results 
a discussion of ffo  adjusted ffo  a reconciliation of ffo to net loss  and ffo to adjusted ffo are included in the presentation of ffo in results of operations following the comparison of the years ended december  and 
results of operations we report operating results under two segments real property operations and home sales and rentals 
the real property operations segment owns  operates  and develops manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states and is in the business of acquiring  operating  and expanding manufactured housing communities 
the home sales and rentals segment offers manufactured home sales and leasing services to tenants and prospective tenants of our communities 
we evaluate segment operating performance based on noi 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements  except for the use of noi 
we may allocate certain common costs  primarily corporate functions  between the segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
these allocated costs include expenses for shared services such as information technology  finance  communications  legal  and human resources 
we do not allocate interest expense and certain other corporate costs not directly associated with the segments noi 
comparison of the years ended december  and real property operations same site a key management tool we use when evaluating performance and growth of our properties is a comparison of same site communities 
same site communities consist of properties owned and operated for the same period in both years for the years ended december  and our same site portfolio is equal to our total portfolio for the years ended december  and the same site data may change from time to time depending on acquisitions  dispositions  management discretion  significant transactions  or unique situations 
in order to evaluate the growth of the same site communities  management has classified certain items differently than our gaap statements 
the reclassification difference between our gaap statements and our same site portfolio is the reclassification of water and sewer revenues from income from real property to utilities 
a significant portion of our utility charges are re billed to our residents 
we reclassify these amounts to reflect the utility expenses associated with our same site portfolio  net of recovery 
the following tables reflect certain financial and other information for our same site communities as of and for the years ended december  and years ended december  financial information in thousands change change income from real property property operating expenses payroll and benefits legal  taxes  insurance utilities supplies and repair other real estate taxes property operating expenses real property noi as of december  other information change number of properties developed sites occupied sites occupancy weighted average monthly rent per site sites available for development occupied sites and occupancy include manufactured housing and permanent recreational vehicle sites  and exclude seasonal recreational vehicle sites 
average rent relates only to manufactured housing sites  and excludes permanent and seasonal recreational vehicle sites 
real property noi increased by million from million to million  or percent 
the growth in noi is primarily due to increased revenues 
income from real property revenues consist of manufactured home and recreational vehicle site rent  and miscellaneous other property revenues 
income from real property revenues increased million  from million to million  or percent 
the growth in income from real property was due to a combination of factors 
revenue from our manufactured home and recreational vehicle portfolio increased by million due to average rental rate increases of percent and due to the increased number of occupied home sites 
this growth in revenue was partially offset by rent concessions offered to new residents and current residents converting from home renters to home owners 
additionally  we experienced increased miscellaneous other property revenues of million primarily due to revenue realized on cable television royalties 
property operating expenses increased million  from million to million  or percent 
the growth in property operating expenses was due to several factors 
payroll and benefits increased by million due to increased wages from annual merit increases 
supplies and repairs increased by million primarily due to increased cost of lawn services  water system and community maintenance 
utility costs  primarily related to water  electricity charges  and rubbish removal  decreased million due to increased water and sewer income 
real estate taxes decreased by million primarily due to tax appeal refunds and reduced real estate taxes in indiana 
property and casualty insurance decreased by million due to decreased premiums on insurance policies 
other operating expenses increased by million due to increased administrative costs  resident relations  and bad debt expense 
home sales and rentals we acquire pre owned and repossessed manufactured homes located within our communities from lenders and dealers at substantial discounts 
we lease or sell these value priced homes to current and prospective residents 
we also purchase new homes to lease and sell to current and prospective residents 
the programs we have established for our customers to lease or buy new and pre owned homes have helped to improve portfolio occupancy 
the following table reflects certain financial and other information for our rental program as of and for the years ended december  and in thousands  except for certain items marked with years ended december  financial information change change rental home revenue site rent from rental program rental program revenue expenses payroll and commissions repairs and refurbishment taxes and insurance marketing and other rental program operating and maintenance rental program noi other information number of occupied rentals  end of period investment in occupied rental homes number of sold rental homes weighted average monthly rental rate the renter s monthly payment includes the site rent and an amount attributable to the leasing of the home 
the site rent is reflected in the real property operations segment 
for purposes of management analysis  the site rent is included in the rental program revenue to evaluate the incremental revenue gains associated with implementation of the rental program  and assess the overall growth and performance of rental program and financial impact to our operations 
rental program noi increased million from million to million  or percent due to increased revenues of million and by decreased expenses of million 
revenues increased million primarily due to the increased number of residents participating in the rental program as indicated in the table above 
the decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of million was due to several factors 
commissions decreased by million due to restructuring of the commission plan associated with new and renewed leases 
expenses associated with repairs and refurbishment increased by million 
repairs costs on occupied home rentals increased by million due to the increased number of occupied homes in the rental program offset by refurbishment costs which decreased by million due to a decline in the average cost associated with preparing a previously leased home for a new occupant 
marketing and other costs decreased by million due to reductions in bad debt expense and advertising expenses 
the following table reflects certain financial and statistical information for our home sales program for the years ended december  and in thousands  except for statistical information years ended december  financial information change change new home sales pre owned home sales revenue from homes sales new home cost of sales pre owned home cost of sales cost of home sales noi gross profit gross profit new homes gross margin new homes gross profit pre owned homes gross margin pre owned homes statistical information home sales volume new home sales pre owned home sales total homes sold home sales noi decreased by million  from million to million  or percent due to decreased profit margins on new and pre owned homes 
the gross profit margin on new home sales decreased percent from percent to percent 
the gross profit decreased by percent from million to million which was primarily due to a percent decline in sales volume 
the gross profit margin on pre owned home sales decreased percent from percent to percent 
the majority of our pre owned home sales are related to homes previously used in our rental program 
these sales convert home renters to home owners and thereby allow us to recycle capital invested in the rental program 
we decreased the average selling price of our pre owned homes to increase the volume of sales thereby accelerating the recycling of this capital 
approximately percent of these home sales are financed by third party lenders or are paid for in cash 
other income statement items other revenues include other income loss  interest income  and ancillary revenues  net 
other revenues increased by million  from million to million  or percent 
this increase was due to increased interest income of million offset by reduced income realized from a disposition of land and fixed assets of million  and increased commission and ancillary revenue of million 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to the additional installment notes receivable recognized in association with the transfer of financial assets that are recorded as collateralized receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the interest income on these collateralized receivables is offset by the same amount of interest expense recognized on the secured debt recorded in association with this transaction 
see note for additional information 
real property general and administrative costs decreased by million  from million to million  or percent due to reduced sales  use and other tax expense of million and decreased salary and other compensation costs of million offset by increased legal costs of million and increased other expenses of million 
the decreased sales  use and other tax expense includes million decrease due to the reversal of a provision for million related to the filing methodology for federally disregarded single member limited liability companies under the former michigan single business tax 
the liability was required to be recorded at december  and was reversed in march after legislative action by the state of michigan

interest expense on debt  including interest on mandatorily redeemable debt  increased by million  from million to million  or percent due to increased expense associated with the increase in our fnma facility fee of million and our secured borrowing arrangements of million partially offset by a reduction in expense of million primarily due to lower interest rates charged on variable rate debt 
the interest expense on our secured borrowing is offset completely by the interest income recognized on our collateralized receivables 
see note for additional information 
equity loss from affiliates decreased by million  from a loss of million  to loss of million  net of million cash distribution  or percent due to limited recognition of our allocation of origen s and the llc s equity losses 
we suspend equity accounting in periods in which the recognition of equity losses would reduce the carrying value of our investment below zero 
provision for state income taxes increased by million  from million to million  or percent due to the utilization of investment tax credits which reduced tax expense in comparison of the years ended december  and real property operations same site a key management tool we use when evaluating performance and growth of our properties is a comparison of same site communities 
same site communities consist of properties owned and operated for the same period in both years for the years ended december  and our same site portfolio is equal to our total portfolio for the years ended december  and the same site data may change from time to time depending on acquisitions  dispositions  management discretion  significant transactions  or unique situations

the gross profit margin on new home sales increased percent from percent to percent 
although the gross profit margin has increased  the overall gross profit on new home sales declined by million 
the decline in new home sales profit was due to a percent decline in sales volume 
the gross profit margin on pre owned home sales increased percent from percent to percent 
pre owned home sales include the sale of homes that have been utilized in our rental program 
the cost basis of a rental home is depreciated  therefore  the gross profit margin on the sale of these homes increases the longer the home has been in the rental program 
an increase in the volume of rental home sales is the primary reason for the overall increase in pre owned home sales  and therefore  is the principal contributor to the increase in gross profit on pre owned home sales 
other income statement items other revenues include other income loss  interest income  and ancillary revenues  net

ffo is defined by the nareit as net income loss computed in accordance gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
due to the variety among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  we believe excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  provides a better indicator of our operating performance 
ffo is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  and operating costs  providing perspective not readily apparent from net income loss 
management believes that the use of ffo has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management  the investment community  and banking institutions routinely use ffo  together with other measures  to measure operating performance in our industry 
further  management uses ffo for planning and forecasting future periods 
because ffo excludes significant economic components of net income loss including depreciation and amortization  ffo should be used as an adjunct to net income loss and not as an alternative to net income loss 
the principal limitation of ffo is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income loss as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
ffo only provides investors with an additional performance measure 
management also uses an adjusted funds from operations adjusted ffo non gaap financial measure  which excludes certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business 
we believe that adjusted ffo provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable when evaluating period over period results 
other reits may use different methods for calculating ffo and adjusted ffo and  accordingly  our ffo and adjusted ffo may not be comparable to other reits

liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to our stockholders and the unitholders of the operating partnership  capital improvements to properties  the purchase of new and pre owned homes  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  and debt repayment 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through working capital provided by operating activities and through borrowings on our lines of credit 
we consider these resources to be adequate to meet our operating requirements  including recurring capital improvements  routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature  payment of dividends to our stockholders to maintain qualification as a reit in accordance with the code  and payment of distributions to our operating partnership s unitholders 
from time to time  we evaluate opportunities that meet our criteria for acquisition 
should such investment opportunities arise in  we will finance the acquisitions through secured financing  debt and or equity venture capital  the assumption of existing debt on the properties or the issuance of certain equity securities 
during the year ended december   we have invested million related to the acquisition of homes intended for the rental program net of proceeds from third party financing from homes sales 
expenditures for will be dependent upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales  as well as rental homes 
we finance new home purchases with a million floor plan facility 
our ability to purchase homes for sale or rent may be limited by cash received from third party financing of our home sales  available floor plan financing and working capital available on our secured and or unsecured line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at december   to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations may be adversely impacted by  among other things a the market and economic conditions in our current markets generally  and specifically in metropolitan areas of our current markets  b lower occupancy and rental rates of our properties  c increased operating costs  such as wage and benefit costs  insurance premiums  real estate taxes and utilities  that cannot be passed on to our tenants  d decreased sales of manufactured homes and e current volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets

we have an unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of million  subject to certain borrowing base calculations 
the outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  million of availability was used to back standby letters of credit as of december  and borrowings under the line of credit bear an interest rate of libor plus basis points  or prime plus basis points 
we have the option to borrow at either rate 
the effective weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was percent as of december  the borrowings under the line of credit mature october  as of december   million was available to be drawn under the facility based on the calculation of the borrowing base 
during  the highest balance on the line of credit was million 
although the unsecured revolving line of credit is a committed facility  the financial failure of one or more of the participating financial institutions may reduce the amount of available credit for use by us 
the line of credit facility contains various leverage  fixed charge coverage  net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which were complied with as of december  the most limiting covenants contained in the line of credit are the distribution coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the distribution coverage covenant requires that distributions be no more than percent of funds from operations as defined in the terms of the line of credit agreement 
the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requires a minimum ratio of as of december   the distribution coverage was percent and the fixed charge coverage ratio was liquidity and capital resources  continued the current economic downturn and conservative lending environment has generally resulted in a reduction of the availability of financing and higher borrowing costs 
although base interest rates have generally decreased relative to their levels prior to the disruptions in the financial markets  the tightening of credit markets has affected the credit risk spreads charged over base interest rates on  and the availability of  mortgage loan financing 
for us  this is the most relevant consequence of this financial turmoil 
we believe this risk is somewhat mitigated because we have adequate working capital provided by operating activities as noted above 
we do have a fairly significant amount of debt maturing in specifically  our debt maturities excluding normal amortization payments and assuming the election of certain extension provisions which are at our discretion for through are as follows million  inclusive of the balance outstanding on the floor plan facility and unsecured line of credit million million million million we anticipate meeting our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions  and operating partnership unit redemptions through the collateralization of our properties 
we currently have unencumbered properties with an estimated market value of million  most of which support the borrowing base for our million unsecured line of credit 
as of december   the borrowing base was in excess of million by million  which would allow us to remove properties from the borrowing base at our discretion for collateralization 
from time to time  we may also issue shares of our capital stock or preferred stock  issue equity units in our operating partnership  utilize debt and or equity venture capital  or sell selected assets 
our ability to finance our long term liquidity requirements in such a manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  our financial condition  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional  and local economic conditions 
as it becomes necessary for us to approach the credit markets  the current volatility in the credit markets could make borrowing more difficult to secure and more expensive

if we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted 
our primary long term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   our outstanding contractual obligations  including interest expense  were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total due year years years after years collateralized term loan fnma collateralized term loan b of a mortgage notes  other lines of credit redeemable preferred op units secured debt total principal payments interest expense operating leases total contractual obligations our contractual cash obligation related to interest expense is calculated based on the current debt levels  rates and maturities as of december   and actual payments required in future periods may be different than the amounts included above 
as of december   our debt to total market capitalization approximated percent assuming conversion of all common operating partnership units to shares of common stock 
the debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average interest rate of percent 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included recurring capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
we are committed to the continued upkeep of our properties and therefore do not expect a significant decline in our recurring capital expenditures during liquidity and capital resources  continued net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the difference is due to increased investment in property of million  offset by decreased investment in affiliates of million increased principal repayment on an officer s note and other notes receivable of million  and increased dividend distribution of million 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the difference is due to increased net proceeds from stock issuance of million  decreased repayments on notes and other debt of million  increased net proceeds from stock option exercise by million  offset by reduced proceeds from debt of million  reduced net borrowings on line of credit of million and increased distributions to our stockholders and op unitholders of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
we mitigate this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the effect variability interest rate changes could have on our future cash flows 
we generally employ derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we have four derivative contracts consisting of three interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million  and an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million as of december  the first swap agreement fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through july the second swap agreement  entered into in january  fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through january the third swap agreement  entered into in february  fixes million of variable rate borrowing at percent through february and is based upon day libor 
in april  we entered into a new interest cap agreement with a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million  and a termination date of may  each of these derivative contracts is based upon day libor unless otherwise noted 
our remaining variable rate debt totals million and million as of december  and  respectively  which bear interest at prime  various libor or fannie mae discounted mortgage backed securities dmbs rates 
if prime  libor  or dmbs increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  we believe our interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million based on the million and million average balances outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a portion of our variable debt is floating on dmbs rates 
if the credit markets tighten  and there are fewer or no buyers of this security  the interest rate may be negatively impacted resulting in higher interest expense
