the corporate revolving credit facility  which expires in june  contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain leverage  interest coverage  and fixed charge ratios 
the facility also has certain covenants which  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur additional debt or liens  pay dividends  repurchase company common stock  sell  transfer  lease  or dispose of assets  and make investments or merge with another company 
if the company were to violate any of its covenants and were unable to obtain a waiver  it would be considered a default 
if the company were in default under its credit facility  no additional borrowings under the credit facility would be available until the default was waived or cured 
the company is in compliance and expects to remain in compliance with its corporate credit facility covenants 
various issuances of the company s public debt  which include the senior notes due  the senior notes due  the senior subordinated notes due  and the senior notes due contain covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur additional debt or liens  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  sell  transfer  lease  or dispose of assets and make investments or merge with another company 
the company is in compliance and expects to remain in compliance with its public debt indentures 
the company s most restrictive covenants are generally included in its corporate credit facilities 
in order to continue to have access to the amounts available to it under the corporate revolving credit facility  the company must remain in compliance with all of the covenants 
the following table presents the calculations of the most restrictive debt covenants as of and for the year ended december  consolidated total leverage ratio dollars in millions consolidated total leverage ratio as of december  maximum ratio permitted for compliance consolidated funded indebtedness additional availability consolidated ebitda clearance over compliance threshold consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio dollars in millions fixed charge coverage ratio as of december  minimum ratio permitted for compliance fixed charges clearance over compliance threshold consolidated ebitda clearance over compliance threshold definitions and components of calculations are detailed in the bank credit agreement and can be found in the form k filed june  in various issuances of the company s public debt indentures  the company has a financial covenant that permits the incurrence of additional indebtedness up to a to consolidated adjusted senior debt to ebitda ratio as defined by the individual indentures

also  the company s ability to make restricted payments would be limited  including common stock dividend payments or repurchasing outstanding company shares 
as of december   the company was below the to consolidated adjusted senior debt to ebitda ratio 
the company believes that cash on hand  operating cash flows  its revolving credit and accounts receivable facilities  and the expectation that the company will continue to have access to capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations as they mature and come due  should allow the company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  uncertainties related to the local  us and global economies and the financial markets  particularly if these economies and financial markets are in disarray when the debt matures and other obligations are due  could prevent the company from refinancing those liabilities at terms that are as favorable as those previously enjoyed  at terms that are acceptable to the company  or at all

future operating trends wireline the company suffered an loss of ilec access lines in as some customers elected to use wireless communication in lieu of the traditional local service  purchase service from other providers  or service was disconnected due to non payment 
the company believes these same factors will continue to affect its operations in future years 
credit related disconnections represented of total ilec consumer access line losses in  and the company believes this level of credit related disconnections will continue in the company has been successful at partially offsetting revenue reductions from access line losses with additional revenue from the fioptics products 
high speed internet subscribers have increased by  in and  in this increase in is a result of the increased construction of the company s fioptics fiber to the home products  which offers one of the fastest internet speeds in the company s operating territory 
at year end  the company had  fioptics high speed internet subscribers which represents an increase of  subscribers from the prior year 
however  the number of the dsl subscribers is declining because the company s operating territory is saturated with customers that already have high speed internet service  and the dsl speeds in some areas may not be as fast as other high speed internet technologies available  such as fioptics 
in addition  the company s fioptics fiber to the home product suite also offers entertainment and voice services 
at year end  the company passed and can provide fioptics service to  homes  and had  entertainment   high speed internet  and  voice fioptics customers 
the penetration rate of this product is about after a one year period following construction in a particular neighborhood 
the company expects the number of fioptics customers to increase in and plans to expand its fiber network in additionally  the company believes the technology for internet protocol television iptv has evolved such that a robust entertainment service can be provided to customers over dsl with minimal network upgrading in many residential areas 
the company s entertainment plans in include a combination of fiber to the home construction and dsl network upgrades to provide iptv service 
long distance and voip revenues will be impacted by several factors 
as noted above  customers may disconnect local voice service for various reasons 
in doing so  customers that have both the company s local voice and long distance service are likely to disconnect long distance service as well 
also  as noted above  some customers have disconnected wireline service in order to use service from other providers 
these other providers 
table of contents are normally providing voip service  which the company offers to business customers 
the company believes its voip operations will continue to expand as business customers look for alternatives to traditional ilec based operations and the voip technology continues to improve 
wireless wireless postpaid revenue in the future is likely to be affected by data arpu increases  as more customers begin using data services and smartphones 
the company s data arpu has increased from in to in and to in given the company s focus on increasing smartphone subscribers  the company expects data arpu to increase in however  the company believes postpaid arpu will remain flat to as any data arpu increase may be offset by lower voice revenue  consistent with the lower voice minutes of use per subscriber experienced in wireless postpaid subscribers decreased by  in the company believes it lost subscribers in due to increased competition  in part driven by handset exclusivity contracts  such as the iphone tm  which keeps the company from being able to sell these popular handsets to its customers 
the company s operating territory is well saturated with existing wireless cell phone users 
future subscriber increases are more likely to come from increasing market share  as opposed to acquiring a customer who has never had a cell phone 
the company s competitors are well established  and increases in market share are difficult to attain 
the company believes it is likely in that competition will be fierce  and its competitors will continue to have exclusivity contracts on the most popular handsets  which could result in further postpaid subscriber decreases in improvements in cbw net subscriber losses would need to come from a higher level of gross activations resulting from enhanced communication regarding cbw s strong network  the value proposition of its wireless voice and data plans  and outstanding customer service 
the company believes average postpaid churn will remain at the same levels as experienced in data center colocation revenues from data center colocation increased by in and in on june   the company purchased cyrus networks  llc  a data center operator based in texas  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
data center colocation is a high growth industry due to the increased need for cost efficient facilities to run it intensive applications to support the explosion in internet based services  including cloud computing  hosted software solutions  and software as a service applications 
the company views the demand for data center colocation services as growing by at least in and believes that it can attain at least this level of growth in its operations 
in  the company intends to continue to pursue additional customers and growth in its data center business and is prepared to commit additional resources  including resources for capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital both within and outside its traditional operating territory  to support this growth 
it services and hardware revenue from equipment distribution increased in and decreased in these customer purchases generally represent large capital purchases that are  to some extent  discretionary 
that is  in periods of fiscal restraint  a customer may defer these capital purchases for it and telephony equipment and  instead  use its existing equipment for a longer period of time 
the company experienced a recovery of sorts in as compared to the slow down of these purchases in  which the company believes is largely due to the financial crisis in the worldwide financial markets experienced in as the economy began to recover in  revenue from equipment distribution began to increase 
the company expects that a recovering economy could help increase demand for it and telephony equipment in growth in managed services and professional services is somewhat dependent on the level of company investment in these product services 
professional services require a bench of highly technical it consultants that are available for customer projects  many times on an ad hoc basis 
managed services often requires upfront it investment by the company in order to realize a stream of recurring revenue from customers 
the company continues to invest in these services  but acknowledges that the primary portion of its investment resources will 
table of contents be put toward data center opportunities primarily outside of cincinnati  ohio and  to a lesser extent  fioptics construction  such that growth in in managed services and professional services will likely be limited 
business and consumer customers as noted previously in item under customers  the company s revenue from consumer access line customers has decreased as a percentage of its total revenue  and revenue from other products  such as data center service for business customers  has increased 
the company expects these trends to continue 
because a large portion of the costs associated with the company s wireline voice service to consumers are fixed network costs  continued productivity improvements will be necessary and may likely be difficult to continue to achieve in order for the company to reduce its costs at the same rate as the revenue losses associated with consumer access line loss 
conversely  the costs associated with the company s business growth products are largely variable in nature 
for example  the construction of new data centers is required to continue business revenue growth for this service 
the company believes it has largely been successful in the past several years at maintaining revenue and profitability in the face of high margin consumer access line loss and lower margin business revenue growth  and it will need to continue to be innovative with new products and services for both consumers and business customers as well as achieve productivity gains for this success to continue in future years 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  dollars in millions payments due by period total year years years thereafter long term debt capital leases interest payments on long term debt and capital leases noncancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension and postretirement benefits obligations other liabilities total long term debt excludes net unamortized discounts and the unamortized call amounts received on terminated interest rate swaps

the contractual obligations table is presented as of december  the amount of these obligations can be expected to change over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 

table of contents contingencies in the normal course of business  the company is subject to various regulatory and tax proceedings  lawsuits  claims  and other matters 
the company believes adequate provision has been made for all such asserted and unasserted claims in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
off balance sheet arrangements indemnifications during the normal course of business  the company makes certain indemnities  commitments  and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include a intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use  sales  and or license of products and services  b indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises  c indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct of the company  d indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts  and e outstanding letters of credit which totaled million as of december  in addition  the company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments  and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the company could be obligated to make 
except for indemnification amounts recorded in relation to the sale of its national broadband business in  the company has not recorded a liability for these indemnities  commitments  and other guarantees in the consolidated balance sheets 
warrants as part of the march issuance of the senior subordinated discount notes due notes  the purchasers of the notes received million common stock warrants  which expire in march  to purchase one share of cincinnati bell inc common stock at each 
of the total gross proceeds received for the notes  million was allocated to the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the value less applicable issuance costs was recorded to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet 
there were no exercises of warrants in   or critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
the discussion below addresses major judgments used in revenue recognition  accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  reviewing the carrying values of long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  accounting for taxes  accounting for pension and postretirement expenses  and accounting for termination benefits 
the company s senior management has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company adheres to revenue recognition principles described in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification topic asc  revenue recognition 
under asc  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
with respect to arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company determines whether more than one unit of accounting exists in an arrangement 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  total consideration is allocated to the individual units of accounting based on their relative fair value  determined by the price of each deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting as delivered or as service is performed depending on the nature of the deliverable comprising the unit of accounting 
wireline revenue from local telephone  special access  and internet product services  which are billed monthly prior to performance of service  is not recognized upon billing or cash receipt but rather is deferred until the service is provided 
long distance and switched access are billed monthly in arrears 
the company bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles  which are spread throughout the days of the month 
as the last day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the company s reporting period for usage based services such as long distance and switched access  the company must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed 
the company bases its estimates upon historical usage and adjusts these estimates during the period in which the company can determine actual usage  typically in the following reporting period 
initial billings for wireline service connection and activation are deferred and amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
the associated connection and activation costs  to the extent of the upfront fees  are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
pricing of local voice services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition  and other public policy issues 
various regulatory rulings and interpretations could result in increases or decreases to revenue in future periods 
wireless postpaid wireless and reciprocal compensation are billed monthly in arrears 
the company bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles  which are spread throughout the days of the month 
as the last day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the company s reporting period for usage based services such as postpaid wireless  the company must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed 
the company bases its estimates upon historical usage and adjusts these estimates during the period in which the company can determine actual usage  typically in the following reporting period 
revenue from prepaid wireless service  which is collected in advance  is not recognized upon billing or cash receipt but rather is deferred until the service is provided 
wireless handset revenue and the related activation revenue are recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer  as this is considered to be a separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services 
wireless equipment costs are also recognized upon handset sale and are in excess of the related handset and activation revenue 
data center colocation data center colocation services consist primarily of recurring revenue streams from rent of data center space  power  cabinets and cages 
these recurring revenue streams are generally billed monthly in advance and may have escalating payments over the term of the contract 
in such arrangements with increasing or decreasing monthly billings  revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term unless the pattern of service indicates otherwise 
data center colocation services can also include revenues from non recurring revenue streams 
non recurring revenue for services or products that are separate units of accounting are recognized as revenue consistent with the company s policy for arrangements with multiple deliverables presented above 
certain non recurring installation fees  although generally paid in lump sum upon installation  are not considered separate units of accounting and therefore revenues and associated costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated term of the customer relationship unless pattern of service indicates otherwise 

table of contents agreements with data center customers require certain levels of service or performance 
although the occurrence is rare  if the company fails to meet these levels  customers may be able to receive service credits for their accounts 
the company records these credits against revenue when an event occurs that gives rise to such credits 
it services and hardware it services and hardware professional services  including product installations  are recognized as the service is provided 
the it services and hardware segment also provides maintenance services on telephony equipment under one to four year contract terms 
this revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract 
the company recognizes equipment revenue upon the completion of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation  or customer acceptance 
the company is a reseller of it and telephony equipment and considers the gross versus net revenue recording criteria of asc  such as title transfer  risk of product loss  and collection risk 
based on this criteria  these equipment revenues and associated costs have generally been recorded on a gross basis  rather than recording the revenues net of the associated costs 
the company benefits from vendor rebate plans  particularly rebates on hardware sold by it services and hardware 
if the rebate is earned and the amount is determinable based on the sale of the product  the company recognizes the rebate as an offset to costs of products sold upon sale of the related equipment to the customer 
the company often is contracted to install the it equipment that it sells 
the revenue recognition guidance in asc  software  is applied  which requires vendor specific objective evidence vsoe in order to recognize the it equipment separate from the installation 
the company has customers to which it sells it equipment without the installation service  customers to which it provides installation services without the sale of it equipment  and also customers to which it provides both the it equipment and the installation service 
as such  the company has vsoe that permits the separation of the it equipment from the installation services 
the company recognizes the revenue from the sale of it equipment upon completion of its contractual obligations  generally upon delivery of the it equipment to the customer  and recognizes installation service revenue upon completion of the installation 
accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable the company established the allowances for uncollectible accounts using percentages of aged accounts receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable  potentially uncollectible balances 
the company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate based on these methods  as the company has not had unfavorable experience with its estimation methods 
however  if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations or if general economic conditions in the company s operating area deteriorated  the company could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
substantially all of the company s outstanding accounts receivable balances are with entities located within its geographic operating areas 
regional and national telecommunications companies account for most of the remainder of the company s accounts receivable balances 
the company has receivables with one large customer that exceeds of the company s outstanding accounts receivable balance 
reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets pursuant to asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company estimated the fair value of the respective reporting units based on consideration of the expected future cash flows generated by the reporting unit discounted at the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  as well as a market approach  which includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results 
in all cases  the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective reporting unit s carrying value by at least  and  as such  there was no goodwill impairment in indefinite lived intangible assets consist of federal communications commission fcc licenses for spectrum and trademarks for the wireless segment 
the company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten years for a nominal fee  provided the company continues to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions required by the fcc 
the fair value of the licenses was determined by using the 
table of contents greenfield method  an income based approach 
the fair value of the trademarks was determined by using the relief from royalty method  which estimates the present value of royalty expense that could be avoided in the operating business as a result of owning the respective asset or technology 
the fair values of the licenses and trademarks were at least higher than their respective carrying values  and  as such  there was no impairment in changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
for example  a one percent change in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the data center colocation and wireless segments  which represents over and  respectively  of the company s total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  would result in a change in the fair value of this reporting unit by approximately million and million  respectively 
reviewing the carrying values of long lived assets the company s provision for depreciation of its telephone plant is determined on a straight line basis using the group depreciation method 
provision for depreciation of other property  except for leasehold improvements  is based on the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life 
depreciation of leasehold improvements is based on a straight line method over the lesser of the economic useful life or term of the lease  including option renewal periods if renewal of the lease is reasonably assured 
repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as incurred 
the company estimates the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of the wireline segment plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets rather than for each individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
the estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets and their related lives change 
such estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods 
competition from new or more cost effective technologies could affect the company s ability to generate cash flow from its network based services 
this competition could ultimately result in an impairment of certain of the company s tangible or intangible assets 
this could have a substantial impact on the operating results of the company 
a one year change in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease annual depreciation expense by approximately million 
the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
no such impairments were recorded in the company reviews the carrying value of intangible assets with definite lives primarily customer relationships when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
no such impairments were recorded in a one year change in the useful life of these intangible assets would increase or decrease annual amortization expense by approximately million 
accounting for business combinations in accounting for business combinations  the company applies the accounting requirements of asc  business combinations  which requires the recording of net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  the company analyzes a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates  current replacement cost for fixed assets  and market rate assumptions for contractual obligations 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  
table of contents especially with respect to the intangible assets 
in addition  contingent consideration will be presented at fair value at the date of acquisition and transaction costs will be expensed as incurred 
in determining the fair value of the company s assets associated with the purchase of cyrusone  the company utilized several valuation methods excess earnings method this method was used to determine the fair value of the cyrusone customer relationship 
this method estimates the present value of future cash flows attributable to the customer base and requires estimates of the expected future earnings and remaining useful lives of the customer relationships 
cost method this method was used to determine the fair value of property  plant and equipment 
this method indicates value based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset and considers the cost of a buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility  adjusted for deterioration and obsolescence 
relief from royalty this method  used to determine the fair value of the cyrusone trademark  estimates the present value of royalty expense that could be avoided in the operating business as a result of owning the respective asset or technology 
changes to the assumptions the company used to estimate fair value could impact the recorded amounts for acquired assets and liabilities  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and goodwill 
significant changes to these balances could have a material impact on the company s future reported results 
accounting for taxes income taxes the income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
the company s previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires 
as of december   the company had million in net deferred income taxes  which includes approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards with a deferred tax asset value of approximately million 
the federal tax loss carryforwards are available to the company to offset taxable income in current and future periods 
the majority of the remaining tax loss carryforwards will expire between and and are not currently limited under us tax laws 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences  the company expects to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods 
however  future utilization is not assured and can vary depending on the company s financial performance 
in addition to the federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  the company has state and local net operating loss carryforwards with a deferred tax asset value of approximately million  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  and deferred tax temporary differences and other tax attributes of approximately million 
a valuation allowance of million is provided at december  against certain state and local net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period 
the company determines the effective tax rate by dividing income tax expense by income before taxes as reported in its consolidated statement of operations 
for reporting periods prior to the end of the company s fiscal year  the company records income tax expense based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate 
this rate is computed using the statutory tax rate and an estimate of annual net income adjusted for an estimate of non deductible expenses 
at december  and  the company had a million and a million liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate is million 
the company does not currently anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly over the next year 

table of contents the company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions 
with a few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal  state or local examinations for years before in  the internal revenue service commenced an examination of the company s us federal income tax return for the company recognizes accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense 
accrued interest and penalties are insignificant at december  and december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s income taxes 
operating taxes the company incurs certain operating taxes that are reported as expenses in operating income  such as property  sales  use  and gross receipts taxes 
these taxes are not included in income tax expense because the amounts to be paid are not dependent on the level of income generated by the company 
the company also records expense against operating income for the establishment of liabilities related to certain operating tax audit exposures 
these liabilities are established based on the company s assessment of the probability of payment 
upon resolution of an audit  any remaining liability not paid is released and increases operating income 
the company recognized income of million in and  and expense of million in upon resolution of operating tax audits  net of new liabilities established 
regulatory taxes the company incurs federal regulatory taxes on certain revenue producing transactions 
the company is permitted to recover certain of these taxes by billing the customer  however  collections cannot exceed the amount due to the federal regulatory agency 
these federal regulatory taxes are presented in sales and cost of services on a gross basis because  while the company is required to pay the tax  it is not required to collect the tax from customers and  in fact  does not collect the tax from customers in certain instances 
the amount recorded as revenue for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
excluding an operating tax settlement gain of million in  the amount expensed for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the company records all other taxes collected from customers on a net basis 
in the fourth quarter of  the company settled certain operating tax issues and as a result recorded million of income  which is presented as an operating tax settlement in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for pension and postretirement expenses in accounting for pension and postretirement expenses  the company applies the accounting requirements of asc  compensation retirement benefits 
asc requires the company to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheet and recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs that arise during the period  but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
the company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans one for eligible management employees  one for non management employees  and one supplemental  nonqualified  unfunded plan for certain senior executives 
the company also provides health care and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees 
the company s measurement date for its pension and postretirement obligations is as of december st of each year 
when changes to the plans occur during interim periods  the company reviews the changes and determines if a remeasurement is necessary 
in  the company announced significant changes to its management pension plan and its postretirement plans 
the company announced that it had frozen pension benefits for certain management employees below years of age and had provided a year transition period for those employees over the age of after which the pension benefits will be frozen 
additionally  the company announced it will phase out the retiree healthcare plans for all management employees and certain retirees from the bargained plan in years 
the significant changes in caused a decrease in the expected future service years for active participants in the management pension plan  which triggered a plan curtailment 
the curtailment gain of million consisted of the acceleration of unrecognized prior service benefits 
the company also determined that 
table of contents the significant changes to the postretirement plan benefits required a remeasurement of these plans 
the company remeasured its management pension plan and its postretirement plans  using revised assumptions  including modified retiree benefit payment assumptions  revised discount rates and updated plan asset information 
additionally  the company determined that these benefit changes result in substantially all of the remaining participants in the management postretirement plan to be either fully eligible for benefits or retired 
as such  the unrecognized prior service gain and unrecognized actuarial gains are amortized over the average life expectancy of the retiree participants rather than the shorter service periods previously used 
as a result of the remeasurement  the company s pension and postretirement obligations were reduced by approximately million  deferred tax assets were reduced for the related tax effect by million  and equity was increased by million 
in the first quarter of  the company incurred a million special termination benefit charge related to union employees accepting early retirement special termination benefits 
the company also recorded million and million of expense during and  respectively  related to remaining special termination benefits being amortized over the future service period for both the management and union employees 
as a result of the early retirement special termination benefits which decreased the expected future service years of the plan participants  the company determined curtailment charges were required 
the curtailment charge for the union pension plan and union postretirement plan consisted of an increase in the benefit obligation of million and million  and the acceleration of unrecognized prior service cost of million and a benefit of million  respectively 
in the first quarter of  as a result of the early retirement special termination benefits  the company remeasured its non management pension and postretirement obligations using revised assumptions  including modified retiree benefit payment assumptions and a discount rate of 
as a result of the remeasurement  the company s pension and postretirement obligations were reduced by approximately million  deferred tax assets were reduced for the related tax effect by million  and equity was increased by million 
the key assumptions used to account for the plans are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
discount rate a discount rate is used to measure the present value of the benefit obligations 
the company determines the discount rate for each plan individually 
in determining the selection of a discount rate  the company estimates the timing and expected future benefit payment  and applies a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high quality bonds 
based on the analysis  the discount rate was set at for the pension plans and for the postretirement plans as of december  and for the pension plans and for the postretirement plans as of december  expected rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the mix of investments held directly by the plans  and the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
the company used an assumed long term rate of return of on the company s pension assets and no return on the postretirement assets to determine pension and postretirement benefit costs in at december   the pension asset returns remained at  and the postretirement assets have zero rate of return because these assets were invested in low risk securities with low returns 
actual asset returns for the pension trusts  which represent over of invested assets  were a gain of in and in  and a loss of in in its pension calculations  the company utilizes the market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and consistent manner 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 

table of contents health care cost trend the company s health care cost trend rate is developed on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the health care cost trend rate used to measure the postretirement health benefit obligation at december  was and is assumed to decrease gradually to by the year the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact assets  liabilities  equity  cash flow  costs of services and products  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the company s pension and postretirement plans point change pension benefits postretirement and other benefits dollars in millions increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense discount rate expected return on assets n a n a 
health care cost trend rate n a n a 
at december   the company had unrecognized actuarial net losses of million for the pension plans and million for the postretirement and other benefit plans 
the unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by changes in previous years related to discount rates  asset return differences and actual health care costs 
because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa  the company is not required to recognize these gains and losses in the period that they occur 
instead  if the gains and losses exceed a corridor defined in the accounting literature  the company amortizes the excess over the average remaining service period of active employees approximately years on average expected to receive benefits under the plan 
accounting for termination benefits the company has written severance plans covering both its management and union employees and  as such  accrues probable and estimable employee separation liabilities in accordance with asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
these liabilities are based on the company s historical experience of severance  historical costs associated with severance  and management s expectation of future severance 
as of december   the company has million of accrued employee separation liabilities 
this represents expected severance costs for employees over the next several years that are primarily related to the company s need to downsize its wireline operations to conform to the decreased access lines being served by the company 
when employee terminations occur  the company also considers the guidance in asc to determine if employee terminations give rise to a pension and postretirement curtailment charge 
the company s policy is that terminations in a calendar year involving or more of the plan future service years result in a curtailment of the pension or postretirement plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company s restructuring plans 
regulatory matters and competitive trends federal the telecommunications act of was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro competitive  deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans 
from to  federal regulators considered a multitude of proceedings ostensibly aimed at promoting competition and deregulation 
although the act called for a deregulatory framework  the fcc s approach has been to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional incumbent local exchange carriers while increasing opportunities for new competitive entrants and new services by applying minimal regulation 
while the company has expanded beyond its incumbent local exchange operations by offering wireless  long distance  broadband  internet access  voip and out of territory competitive local exchange services  a significant portion of its revenue is still derived from its traditional local 
table of contents exchange services  which remain subject to varying levels of regulation 
since  federal regulators have primarily focused on initiatives to promote investment in and adoption of advanced telecommunications services  particularly broadband internet access services 
on march   the fcc released a national broadband plan nbp  as mandated by congress  to ensure that every american has access to broadband services 
the fcc released an action agenda containing benchmarks for implementing the nbp recommendations that fall under its jurisdiction 
the recommendations have been grouped into four key areas accelerating universal broadband access and adoption  fostering competition and maximizing consumer benefits  promoting world leading mobile broadband infrastructure and innovation  and advancing robust and secure public safety communications networks 
the majority of fcc regulatory proceedings are now focused on the fulfillment of the goals of the nbp 
while the fcc took steps to implement some of the nbp recommendations during  implementation of the more complex and controversial recommendations may span several years 
moreover  an opinion from the dc circuit court of appeals in april called into question the legal theory that the fcc had been using to justify regulation of broadband internet communications 
in light of the dc court s ruling  the fcc spent much of reassessing its legal authority to implement some of the nbp recommendations  slowing action on some of the nbp driven proceedings 
during  however  the fcc is expected to refocus its attention on the remaining nbp recommendations 
the financial impact of the various federal proceedings will depend on many factors including the extent of competition  the timing and outcome of the fcc s decisions  and any appeals of those decisions 
intercarrier compensation current rules specify different means of compensating carriers for the use of their networks depending on the type of traffic and technology used by the carriers 
the fcc has an open proceeding to consider various proposals for revising the disparate intercarrier compensation system into a regime that treats all traffic uniformly 
the nbp recommends that the fcc create a glide path to eliminate per minute intercarrier compensation charges over an eight to ten year period 
although the fcc has been considering proposals to eliminate per minute intercarrier compensation charges for the past ten years  it is expected to renew efforts to develop a sustainable plan in early in light of the nbp recommendation 
the outcome of this proceeding could have a significant effect on all carriers and could impact the switched access and end user components of cbt s revenue 
special access in early  the fcc opened a proceeding to review the current special access pricing rules 
under the existing rules  cbt s special access services are subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap 
this proceeding reexamines the entire special access pricing structure  including whether or not to reinstate an earnings cap 
as recommended by the nbp  in the fcc continued to analyze whether the existing rules ensure just and reasonable rates 
this investigation is expected to continue through voip in  the fcc declared that voip services are interstate services and purportedly preempted state regulation 
however  the fcc s rulemaking proceeding to determine the regulatory status of ip enabled services generally remains open 
although not classifying voip as a telecommunications service or information service  the fcc has extended many traditional telecommunications service obligations to voip service providers  including  universal service funding  local number portability  and regulations governing customer proprietary network information 
meanwhile  several state commissions have continued to challenge whether prior fcc orders have preempted state regulation of voip services 
in november  the fcc declared that states may levy usf assessments on nomadic voip service intrastate revenue 
in response to several petitions  the fcc has also ruled that peer to peer internet voice services that utilize internet protocol ip and that do not use the public switched telephone network pstn are not subject to access charges 
separately  it has ruled that services that originate and terminate on the pstn but employ ip in the middle are subject to access charges 
the fcc is still considering other voip petitions  including one that seeks to exempt from access charges calls that originate using voip but terminate on the pstn 

table of contents universal service the federal universal service fund usf is currently funded via an assessment on the interstate end user revenue of all telecommunications carriers and interconnected voip providers 
the nbp calls for a major overhaul of the federal usf programs and funding mechanism 
although the fcc addressed a few of the nbp usf recommendations in  work on the major overhaul of the high cost funding mechanism to transition from supporting legacy circuit switched networks to broadband is expected to start in earnest during revisions to the usf funding mechanism are also anticipated as the fcc grapples with how to fund the universal service programs given the decline in the traditional usf funding base as consumers rely more and more on broadband to meet their communications needs 
changes in the funding mechanism and expansion of the low income program to broadband services are likely to have the most direct impact on the company as a result of usf reform 
broadband internet access net neutrality in an order adopted in  the fcc provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband internet access as a non regulated information service comparable treatment to cable modem internet access or as a regulated telecommunications service 
in  cbt elected the non regulated information service designation for its broadband internet access service 
the fcc also ruled that wireless broadband service is a non regulated information service  placing it on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services such as cable modem service and wireline dsl service 
in conjunction with the adoption of the wireline broadband internet access order  the fcc adopted a policy statement intended to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed  open  affordable  and accessible to all consumers 
in  the fcc opened a proceeding to codify the net neutrality principles established in the policy statement 
however  in april  the dc circuit court of appeals issued an opinion finding that an fcc enforcement action regarding comcast s network management practices exceeded the fcc s authority  causing the fcc to reassess its approach to crafting net neutrality rules 
finally  in december  the fcc adopted net neutrality rules that require broadband providers to publicly disclose network management practices  restrict them from blocking internet content and applications  and prohibit fixed broadband providers from engaging in unreasonable discrimination in transmitting traffic 
appeals of these rules are expected 
if they are not stayed by the court pending appeal  however  the rules will take effect in the rules will be enforced by the fcc on a case by case basis as complaints arise 
fcc safeguards to protect customer proprietary network information cpni in  the fcc released an order implementing new cpni rules designed to prevent pretexting to gain access to customer information 
the new rules  which became effective in december  require carriers to implement security protections limiting the manner in which certain customer information may be released and requiring notice to customers regarding certain types of changes to their account and cpni breaches 
carriers must file an annual certification with the fcc that they are compliant with the rules  including a summary of actions taken in response to customer complaints 
state cbt has operated under alternative regulation plans for its local services since these plans restricted cbt s ability to increase the price of basic local service and related services but  in return  freed cbt from being subject to an earnings cap 
under alternative regulation  price increases and enhanced flexibility for some services partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other  primarily wholesale services 
statutory changes enacted by the ohio general assembly in august gave the public utilities commission of ohio puco the authority to provide ilecs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives house bill 
since that time  the company has applied for and received authority from the puco to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in eight of its ohio exchanges 
cbt implemented rate increases for basic local exchange service in its two largest ohio exchanges in january  in four additional exchanges in february  and in two more exchanges in january in september  the ohio general assembly enacted substitute senate bill  which revised state policy concerning the provision of telecommunications service  repealed ohio s existing alternative regulation legislation  and authorized pricing flexibility for ilec basic local exchange service upon a competitive showing 
table of contents by the ilec 
in december  cbt filed an application with the puco under the new rules to receive pricing flexibility in its four ohio exchanges that did not have pricing flexibility under alternative regulation 
the application was approved in january  giving cbt the ability to implement a rate increase for basic local exchange service in all of its ohio exchanges beginning in the first quarter of furthermore  the new legislation provides potential cost savings and revenue opportunities resulting from revision of the puco s retail rules and service standards that will be effective for most retail services in january cbt entered into its existing alternative regulation plan in kentucky in july under terms established by the kentucky general assembly in house bill no 
under this plan  basic local exchange service prices are capped in exchange for earnings freedom and pricing flexibility on other retail services 
the caps on basic local exchange service prices are scheduled to expire in july  which may allow for additional price flexibility
