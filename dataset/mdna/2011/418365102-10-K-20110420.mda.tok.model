table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview hastings is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that buys  sells  trades and rents various home entertainment products  including books  music  software  periodicals  new and used cds  movies on dvd and blu ray  video games  video game consoles and electronics 
we also offer consumables and trends products such as apparel  t shirts  action figures  posters  greeting cards and seasonal merchandise through our entertainment stores and our internet web site 
as of march   we operated stores averaging approximately  square feet in medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the stores  operated on leased premises  is wholly owned by us and is operated under the name of hastings 
we also operate one concept store  sun adventure sports  opened in and located in amarillo  texas  which is wholly owned by us 
over the past three years  our financial performance has been adversely impacted by a number of factors  including the economic downturn and the expanding digital delivery of entertainment 
as the economy improves  we expect our total revenues to improve 
however  as consumer spending patterns shift toward digital delivery of content and internet retailers  particularly with regard to books  we expect the negative trends in sales of new books to continue and therefore expect a single digit decrease in book comp sales for at least the next two years 
we expect music comp sales  which have had mid single to double digit decreases for the last four years driven primarily by digital content delivery  to have a slight decrease for fiscal our operating strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing stores  opening new stores in selected markets and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates comprise our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly or quarterly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record the lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated market value and returnability of merchandise inventory by product category and record an adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 
rental asset depreciation 
we have established rental asset depreciation policies that match rental product costs with the related revenues 
these policies require that we make significant estimates  based upon our experience  as to the ultimate amount and timing of revenue to be generated from our rental product 
we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation because it approximates the pattern of demand for the product  which is higher when the product is initially released by the studios for rental and declines over time 
in establishing salvage values for our rental product  we consider the sales prices and sales volume of our previously rented product and other used product 

table of contents we currently depreciate the cost of our rental assets on an accelerated basis over six months or nine months  except for rental assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over months 
rental assets  which include dvds  books on cd and video games  are depreciated to salvage values ranging from to rental assets purchased for less than established salvage values are not depreciated 
we also review the carrying value of our rental assets to ensure that estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying value 
we periodically record adjustments to the value of previously rented product primarily for estimated obsolescence or excess product based upon changes in our original assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than our original estimates  additional adjustments  including adjustments to useful lives or salvage values  may be required 
we continually evaluate the estimates surrounding the useful lives and salvage values used in depreciating our rental assets 
changes to these estimates resulting from changes in consumer demand  changes in customer preferences or the price or availability of retail products may materially impact the carrying value of our rental assets and our rental margins 
the costs of rental product purchased pursuant to revenue sharing arrangements  which are recorded in rental cost of sales on the consolidated statements of earnings  typically include a lower initial product cost than traditional rental purchases with a certain percentage of the net rental revenues shared with studios over an agreed period of time 
any up front costs exceeding the designated salvage value are amortized on an accelerated basis and revenue sharing payments pursuant to the applicable arrangement are expensed as rental cost of sales as the related revenue is earned 
additionally  certain titles have performance guarantees 
we analyze titles that are subject to performance guarantees and recognize an estimated expense for under performing titles throughout the applicable period based upon our analysis of the estimated rental revenue shortfall 
we revise these estimates on a monthly basis  based on actual results 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate under performing stores on a quarterly basis to determine whether projected future cash flows over the remaining lease term are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the fixed asset investment in each individual store 
if projected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the fixed asset investment  an impairment charge is recognized if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of leasehold improvements as well as certain other property and equipment is subject to impairment write down 
income taxes 
in determining net income  we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for future income tax consequences that are attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their income tax bases 
we base the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on enacted tax rates that we expect will apply to taxable earnings in the year when we expect to settle or recover those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities on any change in income tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood  on a cumulative basis  of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
share based compensation 
determining the amount of share based compensation to be recorded in the statement of earnings requires us to develop estimates that are used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility is derived based upon our historical stock prices over the expected life of the option 
expected life of the option the estimate of an expected life is calculated based on historical data relating to grants  exercises and cancellations  as well as the vesting period and contractual life of the option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option 

table of contents our stock price volatility and expected option lives involve management s best estimates at the grant date  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes pricing model and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the vesting period of the option 
we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of options that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
in addition to stock options  we award restricted stock awards  including restricted stock units and performance based restricted stock awards 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the average of the opening and closing stock price on the day on which they are granted 
for performance based restricted stock awards  compensation expense is recognized if management deems it probable that the performance conditions will be met 
management must use its judgment to determine the probability that a performance condition will be met 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  future results could be materially impacted 
gift card breakage revenue 
we sell gift cards through each of our stores and through our web site www 
gohastings 
com 
the gift cards we sell have no stated expiration dates or fees and are subject to potential escheatment rights in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
gift card liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of sale of such cards with the costs of designing  printing and distributing the cards recorded as expense as incurred 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  the liability was relieved and revenue was recognized only upon redemption of the gift cards 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had sufficient historical data to analyze gift card redemption patterns and a final determination of the escheatment laws applicable to our operations 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately million of revenue related to the initial change in estimated breakage on gift cards we previously issued and sold 
subsequent to the initial change in estimate related to gift card breakage  gift card breakage revenue is recognized as gift cards are redeemed  based upon an analysis of the aging and utilization of gift cards  our determination that the likelihood of future redemption is remote and our determination that such balances are not subject to escheatment laws applicable to our operations

table of contents trends comps increased for fiscal resulting primarily from strong sales of new and used comics  as seen on tv products such as pillow pets  shaped rubber bands  hex bugs  collectible card games such as magic the gathering  and action figures 
the increase in new and used comics is primarily due to an expanded comic footprint in stores 
the increase in action figure sales was driven by an increase in action figures sold through our proprietary goship program and the addition of collectible action figures to our product mix 
hardback caf comps increased for fiscal primarily due to increased sales of specialty caf drinks 
movie comps increased for fiscal primarily driven by strong sales of new and used blu ray movies  dvd boxed sets and used dvds  partially offset by lower sales of new dvds 
video game comps increased for fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales of new and used video games for the sony playstation and microsoft xbox and strong sales of video game accessories  partially offset by lower sales of new video games for the nintendo wii  older generation video games  and games for handheld gaming systems including the nintendo ds and sony psp 
lower sales of new video games for the nintendo wii were a direct result of low allocations of nintendo first party titles 
consumables comps increased for fiscal primarily due to increased sales of assorted candies and gums  including candies and snacks cross merchandised on our video rental wall  and seasonal candy 
electronics comps increased for fiscal resulting from increased sales of mp players and related accessories  headphones and pc accessories  partially offset by lower sales of digital converter boxes  blu ray players and refurbished ipods 
books comps decreased for fiscal primarily driven by lower sales of new trade paperbacks  mass market books  and hardbacks  which to some degree is attributable to the increasing popularity of electronic book readers  and lower sales of magazines  partially offset by increased sales of used trade paperbacks and hardbacks 
the decrease in new trade paperbacks was also driven by a less favorable comparison to prior year sales of titles in the twilight saga series by stephenie meyer as sales of these titles decreased approximately million  or  for fiscal we expect a single digit decrease in book comps for fiscal  primarily due to lower sales of new books 
in order to address the increasing popularity of electronic book readers  we will continue to focus on increasing sales of used and bargain books as a means to offset lower sales of new books 
comp sales of used and bargain books increased for fiscal we also anticipate a positive sales impact will result from competitor stores closing in many of our markets 
additionally  we are currently exploring the possibility of offering e books for sale on our website www

music comps decreased for fiscal primarily due to lower sales of new and used cds  resulting directly from a continued industry decline as consumer spending patterns shift towards digital delivery of content and internet retailers 
in addressing the current music environment  we have reduced the music footprint in approximately two thirds of our stores  which has allowed us to expand successful categories and introduce new product lines 
sales of used music has been impacted by lower price points for new music  due to the fact that we are now able to offer many new release cd s for less than we have worked closely with vendors to negotiate lower product costs which significantly mitigate the negative impact on gross margins resulting from lower price points and declining music sales 
while music comps decreased for the period  units sold increased approximately 
we expect a low single digit decrease in music comps during fiscal rental comps increased for fiscal  primarily due to fewer promotional sales being offered during the current period 
units rented increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal rental video comps increased for the period while rental video game comps decreased for the period 
we expect rental video comps will be positively impacted as we benefit from competitor stores closing in many of the markets in which we operate and as we continue to utilize the day window program offered by some of our vendors 
the program makes available new releases to traditional bricks and mortar stores  to rent and sell  days prior to making them available to online subscription services or rental kiosks 
for fiscal  we are projecting a positive total comp in the low single digits for both merchandise and rental sales 
generally  it is difficult for us to project future comp sales 
our comp sales are to a great extent dependent upon the quantity and quality of new releases from the studios  publishers  and hardware manufacturers  as well as general economic conditions and other factors not under our control 
gross profit merchandise 
for fiscal  total merchandise gross profit dollars increased approximately million  or  to million from million for fiscal  due to higher margin rates 
as a percentage of total merchandise revenue  merchandise gross profit increased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal primarily due to improvements in margin management  lower markdown expense  and lower costs to return product 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in freight costs  which resulted directly from increased shipments related to our goship program  and increased shrinkage expense 
we saw a slight decrease in shrinkage expense for the fourth quarter  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was a direct result of our comprehensive store audit program that assesses store level execution and controls designed to reduce shrink  with a strong focus on our high shrinkage stores 
gross profit rental 
for fiscal  total rental gross profit dollars decreased approximately million  or  to million from million for fiscal resulting from lower margin rates and lower revenues

use of non gaap financial measures the company is providing free cash flow  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  and adjusted operating income loss as supplemental non gaap financial measures regarding the company s operational performance 
the company evaluates its historical and prospective financial performance  as well as its performance relative to its competitors  by using such non gaap financial measures 
specifically  management uses these items to further its own understanding of the company s core operating performance  which management believes represents the company s performance in the ordinary  ongoing and customary course of its operations 
therefore  management excludes from core operating performance those items  such as those relating to restructuring  investing  stock based compensation expense and non cash activities that management does not believe are reflective of such ordinary  ongoing and customary activities 
the company believes that providing this information to its investors  in addition to the presentation of gaap financial measures  allows investors to see the company s financial results through the eyes of management 
the company further believes that providing this information allows investors to both better understand the company s financial performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance 
free cash flow management defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities for the period less purchases of property and equipment during the period 
purchases of property and equipment during the period are netted with any proceeds received from insurance on casualty loss that are directly related to the reinvestment of new capital expenditures

liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations from the sale of merchandise and the rental of products  most of which is received in cash and cash equivalents

the company purchased million of treasury stock in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal we plan to purchase up to million of treasury stock during fiscal  which will be dependent upon movement of our stock price and actual fiscal operating results 
changes in our cash overdraft position decreased from cash used of million for fiscal to a use of million for fiscal  due to timing of payments issued to vendors at the end of each year

table of contents capital structure 
on july   we entered into the amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended agreement with bank of america  na  as agent  which amended and restated our loan and security agreement dated as of august   as otherwise amended the prior agreement 
the amended agreement is substantially the same as the prior agreement  extends the maturity date of the prior agreement from august  to july   and provides that we may repurchase up to million worth of our common stock 
the amended agreement also provides that we may repurchase additional shares of our common stock in the event we meet certain criteria set forth in the amended agreement 
the amended agreement prohibits the payment of dividends and includes certain other debt and acquisition limitations and requires a minimum availability of million at all times 
the amended agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and our subsidiary and is guaranteed by our subsidiary 
the amount outstanding under the amended agreement is limited by a borrowing base predicated on the sum of a of eligible credit card receivables plus b i multiplied by ii the appraised inventory liquidation value multiplied by iii eligible inventory net of inventory reserves  less c availability reserves each term as defined in the amended agreement  and is limited to a ceiling of million  less a million availability reserve 
the lender may increase specifically defined reserves to reduce availability in the event of adverse changes in our industry or our financial condition that are projected to impact the value of our assets pledged as collateral 
the lender must exercise reasonable judgment and act in good faith with respect to any changes in the specifically defined reserves 
interest under the amended agreement will accrue  at our election  at a base rate or libor rate  plus  in each case  an applicable margin  which is determined by reference to the level of availability as defined in the amended agreement  with the applicable margin for libor rate loans ranging from to and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranging from to 
in addition  unused line fees ranging from to determined by reference to the level of usage under the amended agreement are also payable on unused commitments 
at january   we had approximately million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the amended agreement 
we expect to have approximately to million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve and outstanding letters of credit  at january  however  excess availability may be reduced in the future as changes in the borrowing base occur or the lenders increase availability reserves 
the average rates of interest incurred for the fiscal years ending january  and were and  respectively 
deferred financing costs that were amortized into interest expense during the fiscal year ended january  are excluded from the calculation of the average rate of interest for the period 
we utilize standby letters of credit to support certain insurance policies 
the aggregate amount of the letters of credit at january   was approximately million  which reduces the excess availability under the amended agreement 
at january   our minimum lease commitments for fiscal were approximately million 
total existing minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal years through were approximately million as of january  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we routinely enter into purchase commitments for various aspects of our operations  such as warehouse equipment and office equipment 
however  we do not believe that these commitments will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january   other than operating leases and standby letters of credit  we had not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or third party guarantees  nor is it our business practice to do so 

table of contents the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt principal only operating leases revenue sharing total based on our internal forecasts  we estimate interest payments for fy to be approximately million 
amounts include the direct lease obligations  excluding any taxes  insurance  maintenance and other related expenses 
for the fiscal year ended january   payments for taxes  insurance  maintenance  and other related expenses  which are variable in nature  were approximately million 
as of january   we were a party to revenue sharing arrangements with various studios 
these agreements include minimum purchase requirements  based upon the box office results of the title  at a lower initial product cost as compared to non revenue sharing purchases 
in addition  these contracts require net rental revenues to be shared with the studios over an agreed period of time 
we have included amounts owed and an estimate of our contractual obligation under these agreements for performance guarantees and minimum purchase requirements for the period in which they can reasonably be estimated  which is approximately two months in the future 
although these contracts may extend beyond the estimated two month period  we cannot reasonably estimate these amounts due to the uncertainty of purchases that will be made under these agreements 
the amounts presented above do not include revenue sharing accruals for rental revenues that will be recognized during fiscal uncertain tax position obligations including unrecognized tax benefits of  and accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of  as of january   were not included in this table 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of any future cash outflows related to uncertain tax position liabilities  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard amends the disclosure guidance with respect to fair value measurements for both interim and annual reporting periods 
specifically  this standard requires new disclosures for significant transfers of assets or liabilities between level and level in the fair value hierarchy  separate disclosures for purchases  sales  issuance and settlements of level fair value items on a gross  rather than net basis  and more robust disclosure of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level and level assets and liabilities 
except for the detailed disclosures of changes in level items  which will be effective for us as of february   the remaining disclosure requirements were effective for us as of february  we adopted the provisions of this guidance  as applicable  beginning in the fiscal quarter ended april   with no material impact to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option 
the annual impact on our results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the january   outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately million 
after an assessment of these risks to our operations  we believe that the primary market risk exposures within the meaning of regulation s k item are not material and are not expected to have any material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year
