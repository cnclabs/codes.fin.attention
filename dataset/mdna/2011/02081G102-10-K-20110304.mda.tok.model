non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
certain of these financial measures are considered non gaap financial measures within the meaning of item of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
we believe that non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with the gaap results  provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by our management to evaluate financial results and to plan and forecast future periods 
however  non gaap financial measures should be considered as a supplement to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures used by us may differ from the non gaap measures used by other companies  including our competitors 
adjusted ebitda represents net income loss excluding the effects of interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and other non recurring income or expense items  such as in process research and development expense and acquisition related transaction and restructuring expenses 
we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda is net income loss 
adjusted ebitda has limitations 
therefore  adjusted ebitda should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
furthermore  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss as a measure of operating performance or to net cash provided by operating  investing or financing activities  or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs

the pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the realization of potential cost savings  revenue synergies or any restructuring costs 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and accounts receivable  net of million 
on march   we completed our acquisition of scient x 
subsequent to the closing of the acquisition  we became responsible for managing the operations of the combined entities 
based on our plan for combining the operating activities of these two companies  which includes a combined operating plan and cash forecast  management believes that on a combined basis  such amounts will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least december   including the integration of scient x  as discussed below 
additionally  management believes we will meet the quarterly financial covenants included in our amended credit facility see discussion below 
however  if we are not able to achieve our planned revenue growth or incurs costs in excess of our forecasts  we may be required to substantially reduce discretionary spending  and we could be in default of the amended credit facility 
in addition to the financial covenants  there are other clauses including subjective clauses that would allow the lender to declare the loan immediately due and payable 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lender was to accelerate the repayment of borrowings under the amended credit facility for any reason  we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay the amounts borrowed under the amended credit facility 
if we are not able to achieve the minimum targeted revenue growth and related improvements in profitability to meet the quarterly covenants or we have other unanticipated expenditures  we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the amended credit facility and may be required to seek additional capital and or to substantially reduce discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we may seek additional financing  which may include additional debt and or equity financing or funding through other third party agreements 
there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or available at all 
any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants 

table of contents historically  our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products  proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt 
our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations  acquisitions of businesses and intellectual property rights  payments relating to purchases of property and equipment and repayments of borrowings 
we expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  and potential acquisitions 
we expect that  as our revenues grow  our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow and  as a result  we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve profitability 
we will need to invest in working capital and surgical instruments the costs of which are capitalized in order to support our revenue projections through should we not be able to achieve our revenue forecast and cash consumption starts to exceed forecasted consumption  management will need to adjust our investment in surgical instruments and manage our inventory to the decreased sales volumes 
if we do not make these adjustments in a timely manner  there could be an adverse impact on our financial resources 
on february   we filed a registration statement on form s  or the registration statement  with the sec pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock and preferred stock  various series of debt securities  and warrants  either individually or in units  with a total value of up to  at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions at the time of offering 
in addition  under the registration statement  we have registered for resale up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock by healthpointcapital partners  lp and healthpointcapital partners ii  lp 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on april  and in that same month we completed a public offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  or the offering  at a price per share of  less underwriting commissions and discounts 
of the shares of common stock sold in the offering   shares were sold by us and  were sold by healthpointcapital partners  lp net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by healthpointcapital partners  lp we currently have the ability to sell million of our securities under the registration statement 
in march  we amended our loan and security agreement with svb and oxford  or  the lenders  that we had entered in december and in october  we again amended our credit facility see credit facility and other debt below 
a substantial portion of our available cash funds is in business accounts with reputable financial institutions 
however  our deposits  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
the capital markets have recently been highly volatile and there has been a lack of liquidity for certain financial instruments  especially those with exposure to mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
this lack of liquidity has made it difficult for the fair value of these types of instruments to be determined 
we did not hold any marketable securities as of december  as a result of recent volatility in the capital markets  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
operating activities we used net cash of million in operating activities for the year ended december  during this period  net cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of a net loss of million and a decrease in working capital and other assets of million  which were offset by million of non cash costs including amortization  depreciation  deferred income taxes  stock based compensation  provision for excess and obsolete

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we account for revenue under provisions which set forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
determination of criteria iii and iv are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
specifically  our revenue from sales of medical devices is recognized upon receipt of written acknowledgement that the product has been used in a surgical procedure or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title and the related risks and rewards that go with it 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
during the years ended december  and  we shipped product to european distributors in which the terms of such sales included extended payment terms 
as a result of offering payment terms greater than our 
table of contents customary us business terms and operating in a new market in which we have limited prior experience  revenues for purchases by distributors in europe have been deferred until the earlier of either the date upon which payments are due or until cash is received for such purchases 
during the years ended december  and  we shipped products to us distributors that did not have extensive credit histories 
as a result of a lack of extensive credit history  revenues for purchases by these distributors have been deferred until cash is received 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost primarily determined under the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a periodic basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory  and record a reserve for the identified items 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our biologics product inventories have a five year shelf life and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative implant products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are subject to uncertainty as we are a high growth company  and we are continually reviewing our existing products and introducing new products 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding increase to cost of revenues and establish a new cost basis for the part 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets annually in december or each quarter if business conditions change and an earlier impairment indicator arises 
this assessment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
these assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and the related amortization expense on our estimate of the useful life of the assets 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate  in which case the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under provisions which require that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
the amount of expense recognized during the period is affected by subjective assumptions  including estimates of our future volatility  the expected term for our stock options  the number of options expected to ultimately vest  and the timing of vesting for our share based awards 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award 
our estimated volatility through december  was based on a weighted average volatility of our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering in june and the historical stock volatilities of similar peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available 
our calculation of estimated volatility is based in part on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a period equal to the expected life of the awards 
we continue to use the historical volatility of peer entities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of our stock price since our initial public offering 
our estimated volatility may increase or decrease depending on the changes in our peer entities historical stock prices  changes in the composition of the peer entity group and changes to the expected term of our stock option awards 
an increase in the estimated volatility would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
our estimated expected term through december  was calculated using a weighted average term based on historical exercise patterns and the term from option date to full exercise for the options granted within the specified date range 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zero coupon us treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we use historical data to estimate the number of future stock option forfeitures 
share based compensation recorded in our consolidated statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from our actual forfeitures which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
we account for stock option grants to non employees under provisions which require that the fair value of these instruments be recognized as an expense over the period in which the related services are rendered 
share based compensation expense of awards with performance conditions is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the time the applicable condition is met 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking estimates  the actual value of our share based awards could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 

table of contents stock based compensation has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in thousands  except per share data year ended december  cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total effect on basic and diluted net loss per share income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with provisions which set forth an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not expected to be realized 
in making such a determination  a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance that requires entities to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this new approach is effective prospectively for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our borrowings under our line of credit expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding floating rate indebtedness totaled million 
the primary base interest rate is the us federal prime rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on our floating rate indebtedness remains constant over a year  a basis point increase in the interest rate would decrease pre tax income and cash flow by approximately million 
other outstanding debt consists of fixed rate instruments 
foreign currency risk our foreign currency exposure continues to evolve as we grow internationally 
our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and japanese yen  in 
table of contents which our revenues and profits are denominated 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
commodity price risk we purchase raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as titanium and stainless steel 
these purchases expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact our product costs 
however  because our raw material prices comprise a small portion of our cost of revenues  we have not experienced any material impact on our results of operations from changes in commodity prices 
a change in commodity prices would not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december
