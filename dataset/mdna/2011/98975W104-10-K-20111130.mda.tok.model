item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand zoltek  our operations and our business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business  the industry in which we operate and the strategic initiatives on which we focus 
results of operations an analysis of our overall results of operations and segment results for the three fiscal years presented in our consolidated financial statements appears elsewhere in this report 
we operate in two principal segments carbon fiber and technical fiber 
other miscellaneous and corporate are combined into a third business segment called headquarters other 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations  the potential impact of currency exchange and an overview of our financial condition 
critical accounting estimates a description of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates 
our business executive overview we are an applied technology and advanced materials company 
our mission is to lead in the commercialization of carbon fiber through our development of a price competitive  high performance reinforcement for composites used in a broad range of commercial products which we sell under the panex trade name 
in addition to manufacturing carbon fiber  we produce an intermediate product that we refer to as technical fiber  a stabilized and oxidized acrylic fiber used in flame and heat resistant applications which we sell under the pyron trade name 
we have spent over years developing our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we believe that we have the largest capacity primarily focused on producing low cost carbon fiber for commercial applications 
key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators within each of these segments to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
in the short term  management closely reviews the volume of product shipments and indicated customer requirements in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts 
in the longer term  management believes that revenue growth through sales to new customers in existing applications and new product applications are the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of commercializing carbon fiber 
we expect that new applications  including those we are attempting to facilitate  will continue to positively affect demand for our products 
gross profit 
our total gross margin for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
management focuses on maintaining and improving the gross profit over the long term while seeking to lead the commercialization of carbon fiber and controlling associated costs 
as such  we have maintained available unused capacity to remain poised to capture opportunities in emerging markets 
gross margin was negatively impacted percentage points by available unused capacity costs of million in fiscal the primary cost components of our carbon fiber and technical fiber segments are acn  which is a propylene based product and our primary raw material for the production of acrylic fiber precursor used in our carbon fiber and technical fiber production  and energy 
acn prices increased dramatically in fiscal and due to limited supply 
acn prices follow upstream propylene prices  which have been increasing 
acn price is also affected by demand which is driven by certain plastics and acrylic and nylon fibers 
prices started to decline in the fourth quarter as evidenced by the decrease in acn costs compared to the third quarter of fiscal operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven by headcount and related administrative costs  marketing costs and research and development costs 
we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
we believe that research and development expenditures are an important means by which we can facilitate new product applications 
cash flow from operating activities 
cash flow used by operating activities for fiscal was million  and cash flow provided by operating activities for and was million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in operating activities was due primarily to start up activities at our mexico facility  including increases in inventories  and increases in accounts receivable due to sales growth 
management believes that operating cash flow is meaningful to investors because it provides a view of zoltek with respect to sustainability of our ongoing operations and the extent to which we may or may not require external capital 
operating cash flow also provides meaningful insight into the management of our working capital 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in revenue  our cash position varies 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly as they relate to operating cash flow  days sales outstanding  days payables outstanding and inventory turnover 
management aggressively pursues any late receivables and seeks to actively manage inventory levels in order to effectively use working capital 
management also monitors debt levels and the financing costs associated with debt 
as of september   we had no long term borrowings and million borrowed under lines of credit 
business trends in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our revenue increased by million  or  to million  from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was compared to for the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to an increase in production output and the decreasing acn costs 
raw material costs started to decline in the fourth quarter as evidenced by the decrease in acn costs compared to the third quarter of fiscal at the end of fiscal  we completed our expansion plans and essentially doubled our production capacity over the immediately preceding two fiscal years 
our capacity increase was completed just as world trade dropped and the global economy began to experience deep recession 
during fiscal and fiscal  we experienced a sudden slowdown in the growth of the wind turbine business 
this slowdown occurred at the same time as a significant decrease in the aerospace market due to unexpected delays in the introduction of new jetliners utilizing aerospace carbon fibers 
inasmuch as producers of carbon fibers for commercial and aerospace applications had greatly increased their installed capacity over the past few years  we have seen intensified competition between aerospace and commercial carbon fiber manufacturers in cross over applications eg  sporting goods for which either aerospace or commercial carbon fibers may be utilized 
in this business environment  management continued to focus its efforts on building on the long term vision of zoltek as the leader in commercialization of carbon fibers as a low cost but high performance reinforcement for composites 
management primarily emphasized the following areas increased sales efforts in selected international markets 
we have identified international markets with high growth potential for our existing and emerging commercial applications 
accordingly  we have added sales personnel and increased our marketing efforts in asia 
indications are that the global customer demand appears stronger for business development in emerging applications 
we have identified emerging applications for our products with high growth potential across a variety of industries and regions 
in addition to producing carbon fibers for the existing prepreg technology used by our large wind turbine customers  we have begun shipments of carbon fibers qualified for use in the infusion process utilized by other wind turbine blade manufacturers 
we also are seeking to qualify our products for use in aerospace secondary structures such as floor  luggage bins and seats  and anticipate increased sales in this market as the production of new jetliners increases 
operating cash flows and cash management 
due to an increase in assets related to the buildup of inventory in anticipation of sales growth and contractual requirements and increased receivables  we had operating cash outflows of million in fiscal compared to a cash inflow of million in fiscal high raw material cost for fiscal cost increases in propylene  coupled with an increase in demand for acn kept market prices high during fiscal compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter  purchases of acn occurred at lower prices 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  the company s sales increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales growth is attributed primarily to an increase in volume shipped  which accounted for of the million increase in sales 
price increases to customers and the strengthening of the euro accounted for approximately million and million of the increase in revenue 
carbon fiber sales increased  or million  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal technical fiber sales increased  or million  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal technical fiber sales increased in fiscal primarily due to increased shipments to aircraft brake customers

carbon fiber cost of sales increased by  or million  to million during fiscal from million for fiscal  reflecting high raw material costs described above 
technical fiber cost of sales increased  or million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of the increased sales and acn costs noted above 
the cost of sales of the corporate other products segment increased by  or million to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal included in the company s cost of sales were available unused capacity costs of million 
these costs are comprised of fixed production costs allocated to manufacturing lines which were primarily related to our mexico plant producing below normal levels and amounted to million for the carbon fiber segment and million for the technical fiber segment during fiscal the company believes maintaining this available unused capacity has been necessary to encourage development of significant large scale applications and maintain a level of readiness as we anticipate a return to more robust market conditions 
the available unused capacity costs will decline as production volume increases 
the company gross profit increased by  or million  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber gross profit margin increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal carbon fiber gross profit increased to million from million during these respective periods 
the increases in carbon fiber gross profit and gross profit percentage resulted primarily from the increase in the production levels to satisfy the increase in demand indicated above 
technical fiber gross profit increased to million  or of sales  for fiscal from million  or of sales  during fiscal the increases in technical fiber gross profit and margin resulted from increased production efficiency from utilizing capacity 
the gross profit of the other products increased for fiscal to million compared to a gross profit for fiscal of million 
application and market development costs were million in fiscal and million in fiscal these costs included product and market development efforts  product trials and product development personnel costs

cash used and provided in financing activities net cash provided in financing activities was million in fiscal consisting primarily of borrowings under lines of credit 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal consisting primarily of the repayment of convertible debt and lines of credit 
inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales on the company statement of operations in the period in which the change in projection is made 
the company historically has not experienced material problems related to the pricing or functionality of carbon fibers inventory 
our panex carbon fibers represent the majority of our inventory balance and are available in continuous tow  fabric  prepreg  chopped and milled forms 
generally  technical obsolescence and spoilage have not historically been a concern because nonqualifying produced items can be reclaimed for processing for sale in secondary markets 
available unused capacity costs for fiscal were comprised of fixed production costs allocated to manufacturing lines which were not allocated directly to inventory and primarily related to the mexico facility which is in the initial production stages of the lines which were producing below normal levels during the year 
the company reviews monthly production levels of all manufacturing facilities and unallocated costs were recognized as an expense in the period in which they were incurred 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
zoltek management is responsible for routinely assessing whether impairment indicators are present 
the company expects that the components of each operating segment will exhibit similar financial performance over the long term and  therefore  groups assets accordingly for analyzing whether impairment exists 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group  a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company long lived assets may materially differ from the company determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 
earnings per share in accordance with asc  earnings per share  the company has evaluated its diluted income per share calculation 
the company had outstanding warrants at september  and september  and convertible debt at september  which are not included in the determination of diluted loss per share for the fiscal years ended september   and because the shares are anti dilutive 
had these securities been dilutive  an additional million  million and million shares  respectively  would have been included in the company s diluted loss per share calculation 
the following is the diluted impact of the convertible debt and warrants on net loss per share for the fiscal years ended september   and respectively in thousands  except per share amounts fiscal year ended september  numerators net loss denominators average shares outstanding basic impact of convertible debt  warrants and stock options average shares outstanding diluted basic and diluted loss per share hungarian grant the hungarian government has pledged a grant of billion hungarian forint huf to zoltek s hungarian subsidiary  which translated at the september  exchange rate  is approximately million 
the grant is intended to provide a portion of the capital resources to modernize the subsidiary s facility  establish a research and development center  and support buildup of manufacturing capacity of carbon fibers 
zoltek s hungarian subsidiary has received approximately less than huf billion  huf billion and huf billion in grant funding during fiscal  and  respectively 
these funds have been recorded as a liability on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the liability is being amortized over the life of the assets procured by the grant funds  offsetting the depreciation expense from the assets into which the proceeds of the grant are invested 
the company has presented bank guarantees amounting to of the amount of the grant as received 
the hungarian subsidiary may be required to pay back all or a portion of the grant if  among other things  the hungarian subsidiary fails to obtain revenue targets  fails to employ an average annual staff of at least  employees  fails to utilize regional suppliers for at least of its purchases  fails to obtain consent from the hungarian government prior to selling assets created with grant funds  fails to use grant funds in accordance with the grant agreement  fails to provide appropriate security for the grant  makes or made an untrue statement or supplies or supplied false data in the grant agreement  grant application or during the time of the grant  defaults on its obligations by more than days  withdraws any consents it gave in the grant agreement  or causes a partial or complete failure or hindrance of the project that is the subject of the grant 
these targets must be achieved during a five year measurement period from october to october although there can be no assurance  the company anticipates it will comply with the requirements of the grant agreement when the measurement period begins 
united states grant on september   the united states department of energy awarded the company a grant related to its development of a novel low cost carbon fiber using a lignin pan hybrid precursor 
if successful  combining this precursor with improvements in operating and energy efficiencies for carbon conversion will provide lower cost carbon fiber for automotive and other applications  such as turbine blades 
zoltek is collaborating with weyerhauser on this project and together are allowed a reimbursement of million of costs incurred for the project 
these funds  once received  will be recorded as a reduction to property  plant  and equipment on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this contra asset will be amortized over the life of the assets procured by the grant funds  offsetting the depreciation expense from the assets into which the proceeds of the grant are invested 
financing activity revolving credit facility us operations the company s us subsidiary has a credit facility with a us bank  the term of which expires january  there were million in borrowings as of september   with million of availability 
there are no financial covenants associated with this facility 
hungarian operations the company s hungarian subsidiary has a credit facility with a hungarian bank  which expires december  the overdraft facility has a total commitment of the lesser of billion huf million as of september  or a borrowing base million as of september  
there were no borrowings under this credit facility at september  there are no financial covenants associated with this facility 
the company intends to extend its existing lines of credit before expiration 
based on the history of relationships with its banks and its current financial position  the company expects it will be able to successfully extend its lines of credit 
convertible debt in september  zoltek entered into an agreement for new financing  a convertible debenture package of up to million in a private placement with a group of institutional investors 
in april  the company repaid all remaining convertible debt with cash on hand 
there was no conversion of convertible debt during fiscal and amortization of financing fees and debt discount convertible debt issued in may  july and october was considered to have beneficial conversion features because the adjusted conversion price after allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrants issued in connection with the convertible debt was less than the market price of the company s common stock at date of issue 
the beneficial conversion was recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the convertible debt security and accreted to its face value over the life of the convertible security and expensed into the company s income statement 
at the time of issuance of convertible debt securities with warrants  the company recorded the fair value associated with the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
this fair value discount was recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the convertible debt security that was accreted to its face value over the life of the convertible security and expensed into the company s income statement 
the table below shows the impact of amortization of financing fees and debt discount on the financial results for the fiscal years ended september   and in thousands fiscal year ended september  warrants conversion features deferred financing costs total total future contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of september  some of the amounts included in this table amounts in thousands are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their durations  anticipated actions by third parties and other factors 
the enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company s debt agreements 
payments due by period total less than year years years over years operating lease obligations a capital leases obligations total debt and leases purchase obligations c total contractual obligations a includes a one year and ten year contract for nitrogen gas facility and equipment of approximately million and million  respectively  per year 
b amounts represent the expected cash payment of interest on our debt 
c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty 
supply contracts we are party to a long term supply contract with our wind energy customer vestas wind systems 
in fiscal year  and  we reported net sales of million  million and million to vestas wind systems  which represented  and  respectively  of our net sales 
this was the only customer with whom we have a long term supply agreement that represented greater than of consolidated net sales during any of these three years 
in fiscal  we reported net sales of million  which represented of our total consolidated net sales to saertex gmbh company 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with this customer 
our current supply agreement with vestas wind systems was executed in may and obligates us to supply carbon fibers under a five year delivery schedule  and a rolling three year schedule as long as the supply agreement is in place 
under the agreement  vestas provides us with annual forecasts of its supply requirements  and we receive binding orders for shipments on approximately a monthly basis 
we are not guaranteed specific levels of sales under the agreement  and we are subject to liquidated damages if we are unable to perform our obligations under the agreement 
in general  the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties  by either party with at least months written notice  by either party as a result of a material breach of the agreement that is not remedied within days of receipt of notice of such breach  and by either party in the event of the bankruptcy  insolvency  or change of control of the other party 
in our supply agreement with vestas  we do not have post shipment obligations other than that we warrant that our products are free from defects in design  materials  and workmanship at the time of delivery and that the products are produced in accordance with standard production and sales specifications stated in the agreements 
the agreement states that the warranty shall continue for a period of five years from the date of delivery of the products 
legal contingencies legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty 
when losses from contingencies can be reasonably estimated and become probable  reserves are established 
the reserves reflect management s estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matters and are revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when matters are brought to closure 
if any litigation matter is resolved unfavorably  the company could incur obligations in excess of management s estimate of the outcome  and such resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
all of the company accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates  assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements  and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
accounts receivable collectibility the company evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable for each of our segments based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing or substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
for all other customers  we estimate reserves for bad debts based on the length of time receivables have been past due and our experience with collection 
our bad debt expense on accounts receivable was less than million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations  and other claims related to employment  environmental  service providers  supply agreements  taxing authorities  and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
stock based compensation on october   the company adopted the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective method 
the company uses historical volatility for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option 
however  the company only calculates the volatility of the company stock back to november  the date the company received its first large order for carbon fiber  as that is when the company considers its business to have changed from a research and development company to an operational company 
management believes this is a better measurement of the company stock volatility 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities

commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of certain raw materials  such as acn and utilities 
due to competition and market conditions  volatile price increases cannot always be passed on to our customers 
management assesses commodity price trends on a regular basis and adjusts purchasing accordingly 
the company does not currently utilize derivative instruments to hedge purchases of commodities 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities under its credit facility and other variable rate debt 
as of september   the company had borrowings of million 
at variable rates and a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated our interest expense for the twelve months ended september  would have changed by approximately million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we would seek to take actions to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
further  no consideration has been given to the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the nature and amount of the company debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
the company does not believe such risk is material because of the company s relatively low debt levels 
at september   the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding
