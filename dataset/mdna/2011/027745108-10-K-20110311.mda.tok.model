item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company during the past three years 
the discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
reclassification in certain circumstances  reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the presentation 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies followed by the company conform with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and they conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s critical accounting policies  which are summarized below  relate to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill impairment 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial information contained within the company s financial statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i the requirement that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii and the requirement that losses on impaired loans be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows  or values observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various qualitative factors  including levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in underwriting standards  experience of lending staff and local  regional and national economic conditions  and portfolio concentrations 
in the formula allowance  the historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors  resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk grade category of loans 
allowance calculations for consumer loans are calculated on a product basis rather than by risk grade 
the adjusted loss factor is multiplied by the period end balances for each risk grade category 
the formula allowance is calculated for a range of outcomes 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
goodwill impairment the company tests goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may have been impairment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the company would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
the goodwill impairment test requires management to make judgments in determining the assumptions used in the calculations 
the goodwill impairment testing conducted by the company in indicated that goodwill is not impaired and is properly recorded in the financial statements 
non gaap presentations the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets  such as certain state and municipal securities 
a tax rate of was used in adjusting interest on tax exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin 
the net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased  or in from  following a  or increase in from the increase in net interest income in was primarily due to a reduction in interest rates paid on deposits which was partially offset by decrease in the yield on loans and a higher volume of securities 
the increase in net interest income in was primarily due to a reduction in interest rates paid on deposits 
the net interest margin was for  for  and for during  the federal open market committee of the frb reduced the intended federal funds rate seven times from to  where it has remained for and this historically low rate environment has had a significant effect on the company s net interest margin 
the following presentation is an analysis of net interest income and related yields and rates  on a taxable equivalent basis  for the last three years 
nonaccrual loans are included in average balances 
interest income on nonaccrual loans  if recognized  is recorded on a cash basis or when the loan returns to accrual status

noninterest income also includes net gains or losses on sales  calls  or impairment of investment securities and net gains or losses related to foreclosed real estate 
compared to noninterest income was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
fees from the management of trusts  estates  and asset management accounts were  in compared to  in  a  or increase 
a substantial portion of trust fees are earned based on account market values  so changes in the equity markets may have a large and potentially volatile impact on revenue 
service charges on deposit accounts were  in compared to  in  an  or decrease 
the reduction was primarily the result of lower non sufficient funds and overdraft fee volume 

table of contents other fees and commissions were  in compared to  in  a  or increase  due primarily to increases in visa check card income 
however  management expects this income category will decline substantially after implementation of certain provisions of the recent dodd frank act banking reform legislation  which is expected to have a negative impact on electronic banking fee income for the industry 
mortgage banking income was  in compared to  in  a  or decline 
while revenue was impacted with the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit in september and the overall continuing slowdown in the real estate market during the year  historically low mortgage rates have fueled continuing demand for refinanced mortgages from credit qualified borrowers 
securities gains were  in compared to  in this increase was related to the sale of sixteen mortgage backed pass through securities totaling  and seven new jersey municipal bonds totaling  the mortgage pass through sale was an effort to remove relatively low balance bonds with uncertain  multi year cash flow characteristics 
the new jersey bond sale was a result of management s action to concern about the ability of local voters in that state to restrict tax levies and the possible impact on bond holders of such restrictions 
net losses on foreclosed real estate were  in compared to  in  an  or improvement 
approximately  of the amount was associated with real estate write downs on one commercial real estate acquisition and development loan in north carolina 
other noninterest income was  in compared to  in  a  or increase 
this increase was primarily due to the sale of bank owned property that had been held for future expansion 
the transaction generated a net gain on sale of  compared to noninterest income was  in compared to  in  an  or decrease 
fees from the management of trusts  estates  and asset management accounts were  in compared to  in  a  or decrease 
the decrease was primarily a result of a decline in the equity markets  which had a negative impact on revenue

other fees and commissions were  in compared to  in  a  or increase  due primarily to increases in visa check card income 
mortgage banking income was  in compared to  in  an  or increase 
this revenue was fueled by a combination of low mortgage interest rates and the federal homebuyer s tax credit 
securities gains were  in compared to  in losses in the losses were mostly related to losses associated with preferred stock from the federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
net losses on foreclosed real estate were  in compared to  in  a  unfavorable change 
approximately  of the amount was associated with real estate write downs on one commercial real estate acquisition and development loan in north carolina 
other noninterest income was  in compared to  in  a  or decrease 
most of this change related to one time income recorded in and insurance revenue declines in 
table of contents noninterest expense compared to noninterest expense was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
salaries were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
decreases in salaries and commission expense basically offset increases in incentive compensation 
employee benefits were  in compared to  a decrease of  or 
this was due primarily to the change in the company s defined benefit plan to a cash balance plan  which was effective december   which reduced pension costs by  occupancy and equipment expense were  for  compared to  for  virtually unchanged 
fdic insurance assessment was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is directly related to a second quarter special fdic insurance assessment of  there was no special assessment levied in other noninterest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily due to  in expenses related to the pending merger with midcarolina financial corporation  discussed more fully on page compared to noninterest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
fdic insurance expense accounted for  or of this increase 
salary expense was  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from normal salary increases  increased incentive payments  and increased commission payments related to the higher volume of secondary market mortgage loans sold 
it was mitigated by a mid year reduction in force that impacted less than five percent of the company s employees 
benefits expense was  for  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase in costs associated with the company s defined benefit program 
at year end  the company converted its existing defined benefit program to a cash balance program 
occupancy and equipment expense was  for  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase in depreciation and premises expense related to the mid year opening of a newly constructed branch in martinsville 
fdic insurance was  for  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
the increase resulted from the aggregate impact of premium increases driven by overall market conditions  the expiration of premium credits in  and the imposition of a special assessment in the second quarter of of approximately  in december  the company paid  at the mandate of the fdic  an estimated three year deposit premium of  million which will be amortized to expense over the upcoming three fiscal years 
income taxes income taxes on earnings amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of  compared to in and in the company was subject to a statutory  blended  federal tax rate of in  in  and in the major difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate results from income that is not taxable for federal income tax purposes 
the primary non taxable income is that of state and municipal securities and industrial revenue bonds or loans 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
the most significant effect of inflation is on noninterest expenses that tend to rise during periods of inflation 
changes in interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services 
through its balance sheet management practices  the company has the ability to react to those changes and measure and monitor its interest rate and liquidity risk 
market risk management effectively managing market risk is essential to achieving the company s financial objectives 
market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  however  market risk also includes liquidity risk 
both are discussed below 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is a primary market risk exposure 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by its asset liability investment committee alco and board of directors  both of which receive and review periodic reports of the company s interest rate risk position 
the company uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates 
simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates and maturities of assets and liabilities 
it incorporates numerous assumptions including growth  changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  prepayments  and average rates earned and paid 
based on this information  management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios 
a balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its earning assets loans and securities reprice faster or to a greater extent than its liabilities deposits and borrowings 
an asset sensitive balance sheet will produce more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline 
based on the company s simulation analysis  management believes the company s interest sensitivity position at december  is asset sensitive 

table of contents the interest rate sensitivity position at december  is illustrated in the following table 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are presented in the periods they are expected to reprice or mature 
table interest rate sensitivity gap analysis december  dollars in thousands within year year year to years to years years total interest sensitive assets interest bearing deposits with other banks securities loans total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities checking and savings deposits money market deposits time deposits customer repurchase agreements federal home loan bank advances trust preferred capital notes total interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets loans include loans held for sale and are net of unearned income 

table of contents table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of december   assuming gradual and parallel changes in interest rates  and consistent levels of assets and liabilities 
net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to increase when interest rates are higher than current rates 
due to the current low interest rate environment  no measurement was considered necessary for a further decline in interest rates 
table estimated changes in net interest income dollars in thousands december  change in changes in interest net interest income rates amount percent up up up up no change represents the difference between estimated net interest income for the next months in the new interest rate environment and the current interest rate environment 
management cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income 
computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain limitations are inherent in such computations 
assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates 
interest rate shifts may not be parallel 
changes in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  which may in turn affect the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
additionally  credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt 
liquidity risk management liquidity is the ability of the company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of its customers  whether they are borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs or depositors desiring to withdraw funds 
additionally  the parent company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  stock repurchases  the servicing of debt  and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by the alco and board of directors  both of which receive periodic reports of the company s interest rate risk position 
the company uses a simulation and budget model to assist in the management of the future liquidity needs of the company 
liquidity sources include cash and amounts due from banks  deposits in other banks  loan repayments  increases in deposits  lines of credit from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  federal funds lines of credit from two correspondent banks  access to the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window  and maturities and sales of securities 
management believes that these sources provide sufficient and timely liquidity 
the company has a line of credit with the fhlb  equal to of the company s assets  subject to the amount of collateral pledged 
under the terms of its collateral agreement with the fhlb  the company provides a blanket lien covering all of its residential first mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit 
in addition  the company pledges as collateral its capital stock in and deposits with the fhlb 
borrowings under the line were  of which  was overnight borrowings at december  and  at december  in addition  the company had outstanding against this line  in fhlb letters of credit used to provide collateral for public deposits in virginia 
the company had fixed rate term borrowing contracts with the fhlb as of december   with the following final maturities amount expiration date 
table of contents the company has federal funds lines of credit established with two other banks in the amounts of  and  and has access to the federal reserve bank s discount window 
there were no balances outstanding under these facilities at december  or balance sheet analysis securities the securities portfolio generates income  plays a strategic role in the management of interest rate sensitivity  provides a source of liquidity  and is used to meet collateral requirements 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of high quality investments 
federal agency  mortgage backed  and state and municipal securities comprise the majority of the portfolio 
during  the company sold all its remaining preferred shares in fnma and fhlmc

the company is cognizant of the historically low interest rate environment and has elected to maintain a defensive asset liability strategy of purchasing high quality taxable securities of relatively short duration and longer term tax exempt securities  whose market values are not as volatile in rising rate environments as similar termed taxable investments 

table of contents loans the loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and residential real estate loans  commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses  construction and land development loans  and home equity loans 
average loans decreased  or from to average loans increased  or  from to at december   total loans were  a decrease of  or from the prior year 
the decrease resulted mostly from economic conditions and business and consumer deleveraging 
however  this decrease in loans was much less than the decrease of  or during loans held for sale totaled  at december   and  at december  management of the loan portfolio is organized around portfolio segments 
each segment is comprised of a various loan types that are reflective of operational and regulatory reporting requirements

of the loans due after one year   have predetermined interest rates and  have floating or adjustable interest rates 
allowance for loan losses the purpose of the allowance for loan losses is to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged off loans 
loan charge offs decrease the allowance 
the company uses certain practices to manage its credit risk 
these practices include a appropriate lending limits for loan officers  b a loan approval process  c careful underwriting of loan requests  including analysis of borrowers  collateral  and market risks  d regular monitoring of the portfolio  including diversification by type and geography  e review of loans by the loan review department  which operates independently of loan production  f regular meetings of the credit committee to discuss portfolio and policy changes and make decisions on large or unusual loan requests  and g regular meetings of the asset quality committee which reviews the status of individual loans 
risk grades are assigned as part of the origination process 
from time to time risk grades may be modified as warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding the credit 
calculations of the allowance for loan losses are prepared quarterly by the loan review department 
the company s credit committee  audit committee  and board of directors review the allowance for adequacy 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  factors which are considered include  but are not limited to  historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  loan risk ratings  nonperforming loans  impaired loans  other problem credits  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and national  regional and local economic conditions and trends 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates 
the formula allowance uses historical loss experience as an indicator of future losses  along with various qualitative factors  including levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in underwriting standards  experience of lending staff  economic conditions  and portfolio concentrations 
in the formula allowance  the migrated historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors  resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk grade category of loans 
allowance calculations for consumer loans are calculated based on historical losses for each product category without regard to risk grade 
this loss rate is combined with qualitative factors resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each product category 
the period end balances for each loan risk grade category are multiplied by the adjusted loss factor 
the formula allowance is calculated for a range of outcomes 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans 
the use of these computed values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
no single statistic  formula  or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance 
management makes subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for analytical purposes  management allocates a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories and specific loans 
however  the entire allowance is used to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  including identified and unidentified losses 
the relationships and ratios used in calculating the allowance  including the qualitative factors  may change from period to period 
furthermore  management cannot provide assurance that in any particular period the company will not have sizeable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved 
management may find it necessary to significantly adjust the allowance  considering current factors at the time  including economic conditions  industry trends  and ongoing internal and external examination processes 
the allowance is also subject to regular regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks 
for the years ended december    and  the allowance for loan losses was   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans at each of those dates was   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses increased during by and during the same period the loan portfolio contracted by 
even though these indicators are directionally inconsistent  management believes that the growth of the allowance is appropriate in light of expectations regarding levels of foreclosure in residential and commercial real estate  continuing levels of high unemployment  a growing number of bankruptcies  continued economic uncertainty and weak real estate prices 
the provision for loan losses for the same years was   and  respectively

nonperforming assets represented of total assets at december   down from at december  there were no troubled debt restructurings at the end of or it is the policy of the company that any loan that becomes days past due will automatically be placed on nonaccrual loan status  accrued interest reversed out of income  and further interest accrual ceased 
any payments received on such loans will be credited to principal 
loans will only be restored to full accrual status after six consecutive months of payments that were each less than days delinquent 
the  in nonaccrual loans shown on the following table includes  in impaired loans 
the remainder represent loans which were not deemed impaired 
based on the performance of these loans and existing circumstances  management did not believe loss was probable at that time and did not classify these loans as impaired

table of contents foreclosed assets foreclosed assets were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at  and  as of december  and foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value  less estimated costs to sell  at the date of foreclosure 
loan losses resulting from foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses at that time 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value  less estimated costs to sell

borrowed funds consist of customer repurchase agreements  overnight borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and longer term fhlb advances  and trust preferred capital notes 
customer repurchase agreements are borrowings collateralized by securities of the us government or its agencies and mature daily 
the company considers these accounts to be a stable and relatively low cost source of funds 
the securities underlying these agreements remain under the company s control 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of long term debt

this collateral can be provided in the form of certain types of government or agency bonds or letters of credit from the fhlb 
at year end  the company had  in letters of credit with the fhlb outstanding to supplement collateral for such deposits 
shareholders equity the company s goal with capital management is to be classified as well capitalized under regulatory capital ratios and to support growth  while generating acceptable returns on equity and paying a high rate of dividends 
shareholders equity was  at december  and  at december  this increase was largely the result of net income and partially offset by dividends and comprehensive income 
shareholders equity was  at december  and  at december  this increase was largely the result of net income and comprehensive income 
these increases were partially offset by dividends and stock repurchases 
the company declared and paid quarterly dividends totaling for each of the past three years 
cash dividends in totaled  and represented a payout of net income  compared to in and in one measure of a financial institution s capital level is the ratio of shareholders equity to assets 
shareholders equity was of assets at december  and at december  in addition  banking regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the company and its banking subsidiary are required to maintain 
these ratios take into account risk factors identified by those regulatory authorities associated with the assets and off balance sheet activities of financial institutions 
the guidelines require percentages  or risk weights  be applied to those assets and off balance sheet assets in relation to their perceived risk 
under the guidelines capital strength is measured in two tiers 
tier i capital consists primarily of shareholder s equity and trust preferred capital notes  while tier ii capital consists of qualifying allowance for loan losses 
total capital is the sum of tier i and tier ii capital 
another regulatory indicator of capital adequacy is the leverage ratio  which is computed by dividing tier i capital by average quarterly assets less intangible assets 
the regulatory guidelines require that minimum total capital tier i plus tier ii of be held against total risk adjusted assets  at least half of which must be tier i capital 
at december   the company s tier i ratio was and its total capital ratio was 
at december   these ratios were and  respectively
