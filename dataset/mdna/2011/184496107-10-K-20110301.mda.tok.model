overview during the year ended december   our revenues increased to billion  compared with billion during the year ended december  this year over year revenue growth was primarily due to a full year of operations of eveready inc eveready  which we acquired in july  our oil spill response efforts in both the gulf of mexico and michigan  and improved performance in our legacy clean harbors business 
our revenues were also favorably impacted by million due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
our energy and industrial services business  which is primarily made up of the legacy eveready business  benefited from increased activity in the oil sands region in northern alberta  refinery turnaround work and high utilization rates at our camps in our lodging business during the year 

table of contents our participation in oil spill response efforts in both the gulf of mexico and michigan generated third party revenues during of million  which accounted for approximately of total revenues 
our work in the gulf of mexico essentially came through several customers that ranged from private companies to the us coast guard 
the work fell into four primary areas skimming  decontamination  water treatment and onshore clean up 
we also supplied equipment that included boats  containment boom  skimmers  and vacuum trucks 
in addition  we had a number of recovery and water treatment systems in place 
over the course of the event  our work in the gulf of mexico evolved 
at the height of the event in the second quarter  we had more than  response related personnel working in the region  consisting of our own employees and a temporary workforce that our subcontractors recruited from the affected areas 
by the end of the year  the number of response related personnel was closer to our oil spill work in michigan began in late july and consisted primarily of our supplying a broad array of equipment and experienced personnel 
during the third quarter our spill related headcount went as high as the containment and clean up work was completed by the end of the year 
our field services revenues accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december   due primarily to our oil spill response efforts in the gulf of mexico and michigan discussed above 
margins in this segment improved due in part to this emergency response work 
excluding the effect of the oil spill response work  revenues for field services increased from  driven primarily by the growth of routine maintenance and remedial work that had been deferred by our customers during the economic recession 
our technical services revenues accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  in our technical services segment  we achieved year over year revenue growth of 
incinerator utilization increased to for the year ended december   compared to in on a geographic basis  this increase in utilization was driven by our canadian incineration facilities  which achieved utilization during and our us locations  which achieved during landfill volumes increased year over year 
our industrial services revenues accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  the year over year increase in revenue of was primarily due to full months of revenues  compared to five months of revenues in the prior year  as the eveready acquisition was consummated on july  additionally  revenues in this segment increased due to increased activity in transport and our downhole business  continued elevation of oil extraction investment in the oil sands region  refinery turnaround work and high utilization rates at our camps in our lodging business 
the margins for this segment benefited from our continued eveready integration efforts 
our exploration services revenues accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  the year over year increase of was primarily due to full months of revenues  compared to five months of revenues in the prior year  as the eveready acquisition was consummated on july  traditionally  the winter months are more active for exploration services in canada  which leads to a seasonal revenue stream 
this seasonality was offset partially in by expansion into the us market  which is less seasonal 
the depressed price of natural gas  which led to less exploration and drilling by our customers  limited the performance of this segment during our costs of revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  this increase in expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of eveready  expenses associated with the oil spill response efforts in the gulf of mexico and michigan and directly related to the increased revenues in the legacy clean harbors business 
the costs were also impacted by our continued initiative to actively manage our costs  our successful achievement of eveready synergies  and specific cost cutting measures initiated as a response to the current economic environment leading to an improved gross margin 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents the year over year slight increase in gross margin resulted from the seasonal strength of our environmental business and our emergency response efforts in the gulf and michigan  offset partially by the significant top line contribution of our industrial services business  which generates a lower gross margin than our legacy clean harbors business 
during  our net income was also affected by the following divesting the pembina area landfill and our mobile industrial health business which produced pre tax gains of million recorded in income from discontinued operations 
recording a pre tax gain on sales of marketable securities of million 
a favorable change in estimate of environmental liabilities resulting in a pre tax benefit of million recorded in sales  general and administrative expenses 
the benefit was primarily due to i new site information  ii the successful introduction of new technology for remedial activities  iii the installation of more efficient processing equipment and iv the discounting effect of delays in certain remedial projects 
an effective tax rate for the year of  compared with for last year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of million 
approximately million of the million decrease was due to expiring statute of limitation periods related to a historical canadian business combination  and the remaining million was related to the conclusion of examinations with state taxing authorities and expiration of various state statutes of limitation periods 
recording a million loss on the extinguishment of debt for the repayment of million of the company million then outstanding senior secured notes
