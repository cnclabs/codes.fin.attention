item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under forward looking statements and in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  mine  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals  primarily consisting of montmorillonite and attapulgite and  to a lesser extent  other clay like sorbent materials  such as antelope shale 
our principal products include cat litter  industrial and automotive floor absorbents  fluids purification and filtration bleaching clays  agricultural and horticultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end customer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
we have two reportable operating segments based on the different characteristics of our two primary customer groups retail and wholesale products group and business to business products group 
each operating segment is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business above 
beginning in fiscal  our sports field products were moved to the retail and wholesale products group to reflect a change in management organization intended to better serve our customers 
prior year segment information has been restated to reflect this change 
consolidated net income was  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   a decrease from net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  during fiscal  our commitment to provide valuable products to our customers was rewarded with higher sales 
our efforts to add value to our products focused on new product development and promotion and on existing product improvements 
in the retail and wholesale products group  sales of our established branded cat litters increased during fiscal in addition  we developed and introduced our new cat pride fresh light product in the fourth quarter 
in the business to business products group  sales of our fluid purification and traditional agricultural products increased during the year 
verge  our engineered granule product that we introduced late in fiscal  provided incremental sales in the professional pesticides and agricultural markets 
further opportunities opened for our animal health and nutrition products as registration was approved in new markets 
both groups were challenged by higher costs related to commodities  depreciation and labor which  combined with increased spending for product market research and promotion development  resulted in lower operating margins and overall results 
we issued new debt  continued to invest in our capital assets and maintained a strong consolidated balance sheet during fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal net sales increased for our business to business products group and our retail and wholesale products group as discussed below 
net income for fiscal was  a decrease from net income of  in fiscal net income was negatively impacted by a decrease in tons sold for both of our operating segments  higher costs for freight  packaging and materials and increased spending for product market research and promotion development 
these negative factors outweighed the favorable affects of increased net selling prices  an increased proportion of sales from products with a higher net selling price and a lower cost for fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
segment operating income declined for both the retail 
table of contents and wholesale and the business to business products groups as discussed below 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal a higher average net selling price in fiscal more than offset a decrease in tons sold for the group compared to fiscal net sales of agricultural and horticultural products  fluid purification products and animal health products all increased  while net sales of co packaged cat litter decreased 
net sales of agricultural and horticultural products increased with approximately more tons sold 
our traditional agricultural chemical carrier products tons sold increased in fiscal after the downturn in the agricultural chemical carriers market during fiscal our new engineered granule product  that was introduced late in fiscal  also provided incremental sales in the professional pesticides and agricultural markets for fiscal net sales of fluid purification products increased from fiscal with a increase in tons sold 
sales in some export and domestic markets improved for fluid purification products used in edible oil and recycled oil processing  however  sales of our products used for biodiesel processing declined 
net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose in fiscal as a higher average net selling price outweighed a decrease in tons sold 
product registration in new countries  including china  opened additional markets during fiscal  however  sales in certain existing foreign markets were temporarily disrupted during the year due to implementation of new distribution processes 
in addition  our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales decreased as the coarse cat litter market continued to decline as a whole 
the business to business products group s operating income was  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this decrease was driven by an increase of approximately for combined freight  packaging and material costs 
freight costs increased approximately due primarily to higher diesel fuel prices 
packaging costs increased due to fluctuations in the price of paper and resin 
material costs increased approximately as higher non fuel manufacturing costs more than offset the lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
the group s selling and administrative expenses in fiscal were even with fiscal retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the group net sales benefited from higher average net selling prices and a greater proportion of sales from higher priced products  which more than offset a decrease in tons sold 
sales increased for both cat litter and industrial absorbent products 
these increases outweighed a decrease in sales by our foreign subsidiaries  which is described under foreign operations below 
cat litter net sales increased approximately due to a higher average net selling price and a greater proportion of sales from higher priced products 
net sales of branded cat litter increased approximately due to more tons sold and lower trade spending 
sales to walmart increased during fiscal as our branded scoopable litter was reinstated following the reduction in the number of cat litter brands carried  including ours  in the first quarter of fiscal we also introduced our new cat pride fresh light product in the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales of private label cat litter decreased approximately compared to fiscal as the coarse cat litter market continued to decline as a whole 
sales of cat litter box liners increased due primarily to increased distribution to existing customers 
net sales of industrial absorbents increased approximately compared to fiscal the increase in sales was due primarily to selling price increases that outweighed a decline in tons sold 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this decrease was driven by higher costs  which more than offset the increased net sales described above 
the group s combined freight  packaging and material costs increased approximately compared to fiscal freight costs increased approximately due primarily to higher diesel fuel prices 
packaging costs increased due to fluctuations in the price of paper and resin 
material costs increased approximately as higher non fuel manufacturing costs more than offset the lower cost of fuel used in manufacturing 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
the group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased compared to fiscal due primarily to significant spending for new product market research and promotion development 
during fiscal  we made substantial outlays for capital investment and for market research and promotion development related to our new cat pride fresh light product launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal we will continue to invest heavily in promotion activities throughout fiscal we anticipate such spending thereafter will be higher than historic levels  but lower than in fiscal we do not anticipate the new product to positively impact earnings until fiscal 
table of contents consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal gross profit was negatively impacted by increased costs for freight  packaging and materials 
the increase in packaging and freight costs are described in the operating segment discussions above 
material costs were negatively impacted by a increase in non fuel manufacturing cost per ton produced  which included depreciation and amortization 
this cost increase was driven primarily by increased manufacturing of products that required purchased additives  fragrances and other materials 
labor and employee benefit costs also increased compared to the prior year 
these cost increases exceeded the benefit from a lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
we use natural gas  recycled oil and coal in the manufacturing process to operate kilns that dry our clay 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the discussions of the groups operating income above describes the increased selling and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal included a lower estimated annual incentive plan bonus accrual 
the incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each fiscal year 
the lower bonus expense was partially offset by higher depreciation expense for computer software and equipment  additional compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and increased spending for research and development 
interest expense in fiscal increased  from fiscal interest expense increased due primarily to the discontinued capitalization of interest for a capital project and additional interest on new debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for more information on the new debt 
interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to less interest earned on a lease receivable  which exceeded the additional interest received on higher average investment balances at a slightly higher average interest rate 
net other income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in lease income related to a lease arrangement with a co packaging partner and regulatory expense accruals 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower in fiscal due to the net impact of foreign tax attributes 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from fiscal year end balances due primarily to increased investment in short term securities  inventories  prepaid expenses and accounts receivable 
these increases were partially offset by lower deferred income taxes  cash and cash equivalents and prepaid repairs expense 
the changes in current assets are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  due to additions to fixed assets in excess of the increase in accumulated depreciation 
fixed asset additions included new product related projects at our manufacturing facilities  replacement of machinery and land purchases 
other noncurrent assets decreased  due to amortization of intangible assets and lower deferred taxes  which were partially offset by capitalization of costs related to the issuance of new debt and increased cash surrender value of life insurance on key employees 
total liabilities increased  or  during fiscal current liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal the changes in current liabilities are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
noncurrent liabilities increased  or  due primarily to new debt  increased accruals for pension and postretirement health benefits and higher deferred compensation balances 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on pension and postretirement health benefit plans 
deferred compensation accruals increased due to new deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess of payouts 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a decrease from net sales of  in fiscal the decline in net sales was driven by our retail and wholesale products group as discussed below 
net income for fiscal was  a decrease from net income of  in fiscal fiscal net income was negatively affected by fewer tons sold  however  increased sales of higher margin products and lower costs for natural gas used to dry our clay positively impacted this year s results 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income declined as a reduction in tons sold prevailed over the benefit of lower costs 
the business to business products group s segment operating 
table of contents income improved as increased sales of higher margin products outweighed the impact of fewer tons sold 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal increased sales of higher margin products in fiscal more than offset a decrease in tons sold for the group compared to fiscal net sales of fluid purification and animal health and nutrition products increased  while net sales of co packaged cat litter and agricultural chemical carrier products decreased 
net sales of fluid purification products increased from fiscal  with a increase in tons sold 
sales to new customers and a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products contributed to the higher fluid purification products net sales 
sales in some export markets improved in part due to a weaker us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies  which made our products more competitive in the global marketplace 
a decline in the quality of oil from this year s soybean crop also resulted in increased demand for our fluid purification products 
in addition  sales of our fluid purification products used in the biodiesel industry and in palm oil processing increased compared to fiscal net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose in fiscal higher sales of our enterosorbent animal health products  which were introduced during fiscal  overcame a decline in sales of our traditional animal health and nutrition products 
increased net sales of these products were partially offset by a decline in net sales of our agricultural chemical carriers in fiscal compared to fiscal the agricultural chemical carriers market continued to experience economic challenges  which resulted in fewer tons sold 
economic conditions and price competition impacted net sales of our flowability aid product used in animal feed  which declined in fiscal in addition  our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales decreased  with fewer tons sold 
net sales were adversely affected by a lower net selling price during most of fiscal  however  the net selling price increased in april under our agreement with clorox 
both the loss of a small co packaging customer during the latter part of fiscal and a decline in the coarse cat litter market also contributed to the decreased net sales and tons sold 
the business to business products group s operating income was  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this increase was driven primarily by a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products 
the group s combined packaging  freight and material costs in fiscal were comparable with fiscal  as lower packaging and freight costs were offset by higher material costs 
packaging costs declined approximately due primarily to price fluctuations for resin and paper commodities used in packaging materials 
freight costs decreased approximately due primarily to changes in the price of diesel fuel and the cost of ocean freight 
material costs increased as the negative cost impact of fewer tons produced at some of our manufacturing facilities prevailed over the benefit of lower energy related costs in our mining and manufacturing processes 
the group s selling and administrative expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal  including higher sales bonuses and commissions based on the improved operating results 
fiscal selling and administrative expenses also included additional costs for personnel  market research  product promotion and technical services related to our new agricultural engineered granule product  which more than offset the decrease in similar costs related to our animal health enterosorbent products 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the decline in net sales was driven by lower tons sold  a lower average net selling price and a lower proportion of sales from higher margin products 
the group s total tons sold decreased compared fiscal cat litter net sales were down approximately compared to fiscal due primarily to lower tons sold 
the average net selling price for cat litter declined in part due to increased trade spending for product promotions  which were deducted from net sales  and a lower proportion of sales from higher margin products 
net sales of branded cat litter decreased due primarily to fewer tons sold 
walmart began to carry a reduced number of cat litter brands in august during the third quarter of fiscal  walmart reinstated our branded scoopable litter in a limited number of stores  however  the new store count remained materially reduced from the store count at the end of fiscal incremental net sales at customers other than walmart and increased marketing to promote brand awareness partially offset the overall sales decline 
net sales of private label cat litter decreased compared to fiscal due to fewer tons sold 
the reduction in tons sold was due primarily to a continued overall decline in the coarse cat litter category 
in contrast  sales of cat litter box liners increased due primarily to increased distribution to an existing customer 
net sales of industrial absorbents decreased compared to fiscal tons sold decreased due primarily to continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing and automotive industries 
see foreign operations below for further information regarding our foreign subsidiaries results 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal the decrease is attributed to the lower net sales described above that prevailed over a decrease of approximately for the group s combined freight  materials and packaging costs 
packaging costs decreased approximately due to price fluctuations for resin and paper commodities 
freight costs decreased 
table of contents approximately due primarily to changes in the price of diesel fuel 
the decline in packaging and freight costs was partially offset by a increase in material costs 
material costs increased as the negative cost impact of lower tons produced at some of our manufacturing facilities prevailed over the benefit of lower energy related costs in our mining and manufacturing processes 
the group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased compared to fiscal due primarily to increased advertising costs and broker commissions  which were partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal gross profit was positively impacted by increased sales of higher margin products and lower costs for packaging  freight and fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
the cost of fuel was lower in fiscal compared to fiscal we use natural gas  recycled oil and coal in the manufacturing process to operate kilns that dry our clay 
gross profit for fiscal  however  was negatively impacted by an increase in non fuel manufacturing costs per ton produced  which included depreciation and amortization 
this cost increase per ton was driven primarily by fewer tons produced and increased expenditures for employee benefits and repairs 
many of the other non fuel manufacturing costs  such as salaries and certain labor costs  and depreciation  were relatively consistent with fiscal levels  despite the reduced number of tons produced  due to their generally fixed nature 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the discussion of the groups operating income above describes the increased selling and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal included a higher estimated annual incentive plan bonus accrual and higher employee postretirement benefit costs 
the higher incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each fiscal year 
the postretirement benefit costs are based on actuarial calculations as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these higher costs were partially offset by lower costs for outside legal services  reduced spending for research and development and lower stock option compensation expense 
research and development costs were lower compared to fiscal as fewer new products were in the development stage 
stock option compensation was lower as more stock options became fully vested and no new options were issued 
interest expense in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in debt outstanding and the capitalized interest expense for a new product related capital project 
interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to lower average interest rates 
other income in fiscal increased  from fiscal due to higher royalty income  miscellaneous investment income and insurance proceeds 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower in fiscal due to utilization of prior period alternative minimum tax credits 
total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from fiscal year end balances due primarily to higher cash and cash equivalents and deferred income taxes 
these increases were partially offset by lower investment in short term securities  accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses 
the changes in current assets are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  due primarily to purchases of land and machinery and equipment and increased construction in progress 
these increases were partially offset by additional accumulated depreciation 
other noncurrent assets decreased  due to a reduction in a lease receivable and amortization of intangible assets  which were partially offset by an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on key employees 
total liabilities increased  or  during fiscal current liabilities increased  or  during fiscal the changes in current liabilities are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
noncurrent liabilities decreased  or  due primarily to schedule payments that reduced long term debt 
this decrease was partially offset by higher accruals for pension and postretirement health benefits  deferred compensation and reclamation costs for mining properties 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on pension and postretirement health benefit plans 
deferred compensation accruals increased due to new deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess of payouts 
the higher reclamation liability is the result of ongoing mining activities and acquisition of mining property during fiscal 
table of contents foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal year net sales declined for our united kingdom subsidiary and for our canadian subsidiary 
bleaching earth and industrial absorbents sales by our united kingdom subsidiary declined in a strong competitive and price sensitive marketplace 
industrial product sales for our canadian subsidiary were relatively flat and cat litter sales were lower due to the loss of a customer and lower sales to existing customers 
the impact of these sales declines was lessened by the relative strength of the canadian dollar and british pound compared to the us dollar 
the canadian dollar was about stronger on average and the british pound was about stronger on average against the us dollar during fiscal compared to fiscal  which resulted in higher sales values after translation to us dollars 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the decrease in the net income was due primarily to lower sales and increased costs for freight and purchased materials  which were partially offset by the foreign currency exchange gain described above 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  the increase is primarily due to higher accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents  which were partially offset by lower inventories and prepaid taxes 
net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal year tons sold increased in our canadian subsidiary  but decreased in our united kingdom subsidiary 
net sales of our canadian subsidiary increased due to higher sales of industrial products and a favorable exchange rate for the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar was about stronger on average against the us dollar during fiscal compared to fiscal  which resulted in higher sales values after translation to us dollars 
partially offsetting the higher canadian net sales was a decline in net sales of industrial absorbents by our united kingdom subsidiary due primarily to the loss of a key distributor 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the decrease in the net loss was due in part to the higher sales for our canadian subsidiary  which more than offset the sales decline of our united kingdom subsidiary 
in addition  the currency translation loss reported by our foreign operations in fiscal was significantly less than the loss reported in fiscal the british pound declined significantly in value compared to the us dollar during fiscal  which resulted in a substantial currency translation loss 
during fiscal  the british pound did not fluctuate considerably in value compared to the us dollar 
negatively impacting the foreign subsidiaries operating results were higher packaging and freight costs in our canadian subsidiary 
packaging costs increased due to fluctuations in the cost of polystyrene and freight costs included a multi year withholding tax charge on our leased railcars 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  the decrease is primarily due to lower fixed assets that resulted from the sale of a building in our united kingdom subsidiary and lower accounts receivable and inventories 
these decreases were partially offset by higher cash and cash equivalents balances 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing and upgrading real estate  equipment and facilities  and investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we have principally used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash and cash equivalents totaled   and  at july   and  respectively 
as of july   there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with harris na 
table of contents the following table sets forth certain elements of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands fiscal year ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the change was due primarily to working capital fluctuations and changes in other accounts 
the changes in the primary components of working capital and other accounts that impacted operating cash flows for these years are as follows deferred income taxes were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to lower accrued expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expense 
deferred income taxes were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to higher accrued expenses and increased postretirement benefits liabilities 
depreciation and amortization expense has increased in both years due to replacement of machinery and new capital projects at our manufacturing facilities 
the change in accrued expenses for both years is discussed below 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee benefit plans 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was due primarily to higher fiscal fourth quarter sales compared to fiscal fourth quarter sales 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the decrease was due primarily to lower fiscal fourth quarter sales compared to fiscal fourth quarter sales 
inventories were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end finished goods and packaging inventories were up due primarily to higher costs 
purchased materials inventories were also up due to cost increases and the mix of products produced 
inventories were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end finished goods and packaging inventories were down due to lower sales requirements 
lower packaging costs also contributed to lower packaging inventories 
prepaid expenses increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to an increase in prepaid income taxes and higher prepaid advertising costs at july  prepaid expenses decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end primarily due to lower prepaid repair expense  which was impacted by the timing of repairs and the ongoing efforts to improve spare parts inventory management 
other assets increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to capitalization of costs related to the issuance of new debt and increased cash surrender value of life insurance on key employees 
these increases were partially offset by amortization of intangible assets 
other assets decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the decrease included the reclassification of the current portion of a lease receivable and amortization of intangible assets  which were partially offset by an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance on key employees 
accounts payable increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to an increase in trade accounts payable which was partially offset by lower income taxes payable 
income taxes payable decreased due to a combination of lower income in the current year  the utilization of certain deferred tax assets and additional depreciation deductions due to recent legislative changes 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
accounts payable increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to higher income taxes payable 
income taxes payable increased due to current year tax accruals 
changes in trade accounts payable in all periods are also subject to normal fluctuations in the timing of payments 

table of contents accrued expenses decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued expenses included a lower discretionary bonus accrual for fiscal this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued freight and other accrued operating expenses due to higher freight costs and timing of payments 
accrued expenses increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued expenses included a higher discretionary bonus accrual for fiscal accrued freight and other accrued operating expenses increased due to timing of payments 
accrued trade promotions and advertising increased due to more marketing programs 
deferred compensation increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end as employee deferrals and interest on accumulated deferred compensation balances exceeded payouts  including the first payout of an executive deferred bonus award under our annual incentive plan 
deferred compensation increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal as employee deferrals and interest on accumulated deferred compensation balances exceeded payouts

the postretirement benefits are based on actuarially calculated benefit obligations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee benefit plans 
other liabilities increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to higher accruals for postretirement benefits and projected future reclamation obligations for mining properties

we have a  unsecured revolving credit agreement with harris na harris which will expire december  the credit agreement provides that we may select a variable rate based on either harris prime rate or a libor based rate  plus a margin which varies depending on our debt to earnings ratio  or a fixed rate as agreed between us and harris 
at july   the variable rates would have been for the harris prime based rate or for the libor based rate 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions  limit our ability to incur additional 
table of contents indebtedness or to dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with its covenants 
while there can be no assurance regarding the terms  timing or consummation of any successor agreement  on or before the expiration of this agreement on december   we expect to enter into a successor credit arrangement with harris na or another financing source under terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to us  however  future developments in the financial and credit markets could limit our ability to draw on or to enter into any such credit arrangement 
on november   we sold at aggregate face value  in senior promissory notes to the prudential insurance company of america  prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  forethought life insurance company  physicians mutual insurance company and bcbsm  inc dba blue cross and blue shield of minnesota pursuant to a note agreement dated november  the note agreement 
the notes bear interest at per annum and mature on august  the proceeds of the sale may be used to fund future principal payments of our debt  acquisitions  stock repurchases  capital expenditures and for working capital purposes 
the note agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things  i incur liens  ii incur indebtedness  iii merge or consolidate  iv sell assets  v sell stock of those certain subsidiaries  vi engage in business that would change the general nature of the business we are engaged in  and vii enter into transactions other than on arm s length terms with affiliates 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our current revolving credit facility  and any successor agreements  and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
we expect cash requirements for capital expenditures in fiscal to be lower than in fiscal due to completion of projects at our manufacturing facilities related to new products  however  we intend to spend significantly for product promotion activities throughout the new product introduction in fiscal and we anticipate such spending thereafter will be higher than historic levels 
our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including  but not limited to  the current credit agreement and any successor agreements  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the unconditional purchase obligations represent forward purchase contracts we have entered into for a portion of our natural gas fuel needs for fiscal as of july   the remaining purchase obligation was  for  mmbtu for fiscal these contracts were entered into in the normal course of business and no contracts were entered into for speculative purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we made a contribution of approximately  to our defined benefit pension plan 
we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for certain information regarding the potential impact of financial market fluctuations on pension plan assets and future funding contributions 

table of contents amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years other commercial commitments the obligations above are open purchase orders primarily for packaging and other ingredients used in our products 
the expected timing of payments of these obligations is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies annually to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include promotional programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  pension accounting and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
trade receivables 
we recognize trade receivables when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer 
we record for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
a customer account is determined to be uncollectible when we have completed our internal collection procedures  including termination of shipments  direct customer contact and formal demand of payment 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  however  the unanticipated default by a customer with a material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the obsolescence reserve not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
reclamation 
during the normal course of our mining process we remove overburden and perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill older sites 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability of the reclamation process 
on an annual basis we evaluate our potential reclamation liability in accordance with asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
as of july  and  we have recorded an estimated net reclamation asset of  and  respectively  and a corresponding estimated reclamation liability of  and  respectively 
these values represent the discounted present value of the estimated future mining reclamation costs at the production plants 
the reclamation 
table of contents assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the various mines 
the reclamation liabilities are increased based on a yearly accretion charge  once again over the estimated useful lives of the mines 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires that we make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in the future could significantly differ from estimated amounts 
future changes to environmental laws could increase the extent of reclamation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amount incurred for reclamation costs 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
we review carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets periodically for possible impairment in accordance asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the first quarter of the fiscal year and when indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts indicate that an asset may become impaired 
we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
trade promotions 
we routinely commit to one time or ongoing trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
promotional reserves are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
to estimate trade promotion reserves  we rely on our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while we believe our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
we have accrued liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated trade spending programs 
we recorded liabilities of  and  for trade promotions at july  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock options and restricted stock issued under our long term incentive plans in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date and the recognition in the financial statements of the related compensation expense over the appropriate vesting period 
the fair value of stock based compensation was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method 
this method requires management to make certain estimates  including estimating the expected term of stock options  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  net of related tax effect 
these amounts include expense related to stock option grants and restricted stock 
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we calculate our pension and postretirement health benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations using actuarial models 
to measure the expense and obligations  we must make a variety of estimates including critical assumptions for the discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
as these assumptions change from period to period  recorded pension and postretirement health benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate is the rate assumed to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due 
the discount rate is subject to change each year 
we refer to an applicable index and the expected duration of the benefit payments to select a discount rate at which we believe the benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate was the single equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as the plan s expected cashflows discounted with spot rates on a yield curve of investment grade corporate bonds 
the yield curve is the citigroup pension liability index 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of plan assets  which is the fair market value 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to 
table of contents develop a composite rate of return assumption 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the tax effect of the expected reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could affect the realization of deferred tax assets 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance at july  has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax benefit related to our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards since we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit of these credits will not be realized 
in addition to valuation allowances  we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet certain recognition thresholds or measurement standards 
amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on tax positions related to the current and prior fiscal years were  at july  and  at july  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued guidance under asc  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements  that requires new disclosures related to level fair value measurements 
adoption of this guidance may result in enhanced disclosures beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending october  and will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance under asc  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
these amendments clarify fasb intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending april  in june  the fasb issued guidance under asc  comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  that requires presentation of the components of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate consecutive statements 
the requirements eliminate the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
the components recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance will not change 
the presentation requirements will be adopted beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending october  and will be applied retrospectively 
in september  the fasb issued guidance under asc  testing goodwill for impairment  that provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if the annual two step test of goodwill for impairment must be performed 
if  based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then the two step impairment test must be performed to identify potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our annual goodwill impairment testing for our fiscal year beginning august  
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and employ policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk  primarily us dollar british pound  us dollar euro and us dollar canadian dollar  as it relates to certain accounts receivables and our foreign operations 
foreign currency denominated accounts receivable is a small fraction of our consolidated accounts receivable 
we are also subject to translation exposure of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
in recent years  our foreign subsidiaries have not generated a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales or net income 
we do not enter into any hedge contracts in an attempt to offset any adverse effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
we believe that the foreign currency fluctuation risk is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to market risk at it relates to the investments of plan assets under our defined benefit pension plan 
the fair value of these assets is subject to change due to fluctuations in the financial markets 
a lower asset value may increase our pension expense and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of future funding contributions 
we are exposed to regulatory risk in the fluids purification  agricultural and animal health markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain throughout the world  but particularly in the united states and europe 
we actively monitor developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which we are a member 
we are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to fuel 
we monitor fuel market trends and we may contract for a portion of our anticipated fuel needs using forward purchase contracts to mitigate the volatility of our kiln fuel prices 
natural gas prices have remained reasonably stable  therefore  as of july   we have purchased a limited number of natural gas contracts for our planned kiln fuel needs for fiscal all contracts are related to the normal course of business and no contracts are entered into for speculative purposes 
we continue to purchase natural gas at spot rates on a month to month basis to meet our needs 
the following table provides information about our natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts  the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ended july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of our natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed us to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued  and in some cases expanded  use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on our fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market 
please also see item a risk factors above for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face in our business
