overview introduction orbital sciences corporation develops and manufactures small and medium class rockets and space systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products and services include the following launch vehicles rockets that are used as small and medium class space launch vehicles that place satellites into earth orbit and escape trajectories  interceptor and target vehicles for missile defense systems and suborbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of high altitude trajectories 
satellites and space systems small and medium class satellites that are used to enable global and regional communications and broadcasting  conduct space related scientific research  collect imagery and other remotely sensed data about the earth  carry out interplanetary and other deep space exploration missions and demonstrate new space technologies 
advanced space programs human rated space systems for earth orbit and deep space exploration  and small and medium class satellites primarily used for national security space programs and to demonstrate new space technologies 
our general strategy is to develop and expand a core integrated business of space and launch system technologies and products  focusing on the design and manufacture of affordable rockets  satellites and other space systems in order to establish and expand positions in niche markets that have not typically been emphasized by our larger competitors 
another part of our strategy is to seek customer contracts that will fund new product development and enhancements to our existing launch vehicle and space systems product lines 
as a result of our capabilities and experience in designing  developing  manufacturing and operating a broad range of small and medium class rockets and space systems  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the demand for more affordable space technology systems in commercial sa tellite communications  space based military and intelligence operations and military defense programs  and to take 
table of contents advantage of government sponsored initiatives for human space exploration  space based scientific research and interplanetary exploration 
in april  we acquired the spacecraft development and manufacturing business of general dynamics advanced information systems  a subsidiary of general dynamics corporation  for million  as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
we expect the acquisition to further strengthen our competitive position in defense and intelligence  civil government and commercial satellite markets 
business and industry considerations us government business during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with other us government contractors 
most of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
as a result  our financial results in any period could be impacted substantially by trends in us government spending  shifting priorities in dod  nasa and other agency budgets  the types of contracts and payment terms mandated by the us government and changes in the executive branch and congress 
these factors  which are largely beyond our control  could have a significant impact on our business 
a major focus of the obama administration s civil space strategy is to provide funding intended to stimulate the development of advanced technologies  including human spaceflight and exploration programs  as well as to promote earth and space science investigations 
the administration also appears to remain committed to supporting the development of commercial systems that will provide transportation services to the iss  with a preliminary focus on cargo transportation but also investment in developing commercial human transport services 
our crs contract with nasa to perform cargo transportation missions to the iss was our largest contract in  accounting for approximately of our revenues  and we expect it to continue to account for a material percentage of our revenues in prior to the crs contract  our largest us government contract had been a major subcontract on mda s gmd program to manufacture interceptor boosters designed to defend against ballistic missile attacks 
the contract is winding down  and while we are well positioned for the follow on contract that we expect will be awarded in  the anticipated contract value will be substantially less than the current program 
while the current proposed federal defense budget continues to provide substantial funding for mda and other agencies within dod  the proposed defense budget demonstrates a continuing priority shift away from long range threats toward missile systems with short and medium range capability 
dod is in the process of defining mission requirements and program budgets to reflect this chan ge 
we believe the capabilities of our target launch vehicle product lines could meet the requirements of a variety of national missile defense systems 
the requirements  magnitude and timing of new procurements and funding for existing programs  however  remain uncertain  particularly after the change in control of the house of representatives following the mid term congressional elections in the federal budget for 
table of contents fiscal year has not yet been enacted and the current congressional continuing resolution provides funding for existing federal programs at current or reduced levels 
while some programs have not been affected by the lack of agreement on a budget  a number of proposed missile and civil and national security satellite programs have had funding delayed until the fiscal year budget is completed 
despite our generally favorable outlook with respect to our us government business  future us government funding for space exploration  science and defense may be negatively affected by federal budgetary constraints beyond our control and the redeployment of federal funds for various economic and other initiatives 
conversely  the reduced levels of available funding may also prompt the us government to pursue missions that can be performed by the types of small and medium class  less expensive space systems that orbital has developed 
commercial satellites business our largest commercial business is the design and manufacture of small class geo communications satellites 
communications satellites accounted for  and of our consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
the commercial communications satellite market is driven by economic conditions that may affect satellite operators directly as well as their satellite replacement requirements 
the majority of geo communications satellites are medium class and large class satellites 
in  the total number of commercial satellite orders decreased from the total number of orders in  which had reflected a record high since we believe that the number of annual geo satellite orders will remain constant or decline as commercial operators make progress in replacing aging fleets of communications satellites and as the worldwide demand for satellite based communications services expands at slower rates 
taurus ii and cots research and development programs since  we have been engaged in major product development efforts 
we are developing the taurus ii medium capacity rocket that will substantially increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles 
in  we entered into an agreement with nasa to design  build and demonstrate a new space transportation system under the cots research and development program that has the capability to deliver cargo and other supplies to the iss 
our research and development expenses in totaled million  of which million related to the taurus ii and cots programs 
we believe that while we will continue to incur significant research and development expenses on the taurus i i and cots programs in  the amounts are expected to be less than we incurred in we plan to use the taurus ii launch vehicle and the cygnus advanced maneuvering spacecraft that we are developing for the cots demonstration mission in the performance of our crs contract with nasa 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and 
table of contents assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences may be material 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
 frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and operating profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
many of our contracts include provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on performance in relation to established targets or customer evaluations 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based upon historical experience and other objective criteria 
if performance under such contracts were to differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues and profits would be adjusted and could fluctuate significantly 
as of december  and  unbilled receivables included approximately million and million  respectively  of incentive fees on certain completed satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
certain satellite contracts require the company to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied 
as of december   we could be required to refund up to approximately million to customers if certain completed satellites were to fail to satisfy performance criteria 
we generally procure insurance policies that we believe would indemnify us for satellite incentive fees that are not earned and for potential performance refund obligations 

table of contents research and development expenditures for company sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred 
research and development projects performed under contracts for customers are recorded as contract costs 
in  we entered into the cots agreement with nasa to design  build and demonstrate a new space transportation system for delivering cargo and supplies to the iss 
the cots agreement is being accounted for as a best efforts research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to our cots program research and development expenses  including associated general and administrative expenses 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount consi dered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues our consolidated revenues were  million in  an increase of million  or  compared to due to higher revenues in our satellites and space systems and advanced space programs segments  offset by slightly lower revenues in our launch vehicles segment 
satellites and space systems segment revenues increased million  or  in due to increased activity on communications satellite contracts  science and remote sensing satellite contracts  including contracts acquired in our april spacecraft business acquisition acquisition  and technical services contracts

table of contents the cots program is being accounted for as a best efforts research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to the company s cots program research and development expenses  including associated general and administrative expenses 
under the cots agreement  as amended  as of december   nasa has agreed to pay us million in cash milestone payments  partially funding our program costs which are currently estimated to be approximately million

research and development expenses attributable to our taurus ii launch vehicle development program were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that the majority of our research and development expenses are recoverable and billable under our contracts with the us government 
charging practices relating to research and development and other costs that may be charged directly or indirectly to government contracts are subject to audit by us government agencies to determine if such costs are reasonable and allowable under government contracting regulations and accounting practices 
we believe that the research and development costs incurred in connection with our taurus ii development program are allowable  although the us government has not yet made a final determination

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposure is primarily related to the market value of certain investments that we hold as of december   changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
investments as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k  we currently hold investments in certain auction rate and preferred stock securities that have experienced a decline in fair value resulting in our recording certain other than temporary impairment charges 
we may be required to record additional impairment charges if there are further reductions in the fair value of these investments in future periods 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we believe that the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates is not a substantial risk to us because the large majority of our business transactions are denominated in us dollars 
at december   we had million of receivables denominated in japanese yen 
from time to time  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on receivables or expected payments denominated in foreign currency 
at december   we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and financing activities  which include debt as well as cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible notes is affected by our stock price 
the total 
table of contents estimated fair value of our convertible debt at december  was million 
the fair value was determined based upon market prices quoted by a broker dealer 
we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations for cash and cash equivalents is not significant 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 
we assess our interest rate risks on a regular basis and do not currently use financial instruments to mitigate these risks 
deferred compensation plan we have an unfunded deferred compensation plan for senior managers and executive officers with a total liability balance of million at december  this liability is subject to fluctuation based upon the market value of the investment options selected by participants
