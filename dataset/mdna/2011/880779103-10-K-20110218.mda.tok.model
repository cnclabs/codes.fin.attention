our mp segment designs  manufactures and markets materials processing equipment  including crushers  washing systems  screens  apron feeders and related components and replacement parts 
construction  quarrying  mining and government customers use our mp products in construction and infrastructure projects and various quarrying and mining applications 
we also assist customers in their rental  leasing and acquisition of our products through tfs 
on february   we completed the disposition of our mining business to bucyrus 
the results of the mining business were consolidated within the former materials processing mining segment 
on december   we sold the assets of our construction trailer business 
the results of this business were formerly consolidated within the awp segment 
in march  we sold the assets of our powertrain pumps business and gears business 
the results of these businesses were formerly consolidated within the construction segment 
on march   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our atlas heavy construction equipment and knuckle boom crane businesses 
the results of these businesses were formerly consolidated within the construction and cranes segments  respectively 
on april   we completed the portion of this transaction related to the operations in germany and completed the portion of this transaction related to the operation in the united kingdom on august  due to the divestiture of these businesses  the reporting of these businesses has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
non gaap measures in this document  we refer to various gaap us generally accepted accounting principles and non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies 
we present non gaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with additional analytical tools which we believe are useful in evaluating our operating results and the ongoing performance of our underlying businesses 
we do not  nor do we suggest that investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
non gaap measures we use include the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on net sales  gross profit  selling  general administrative sg a costs and operating profit  as well as the net sales  gross profit  sg a costs and operating profit excluding the impact of acquisitions 
as changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on our financial results  we believe excluding the effect of these changes assists in the assessment of our business results between periods 
we calculate the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes by translating the current period results at the rates that the comparable prior periods were translated to isolate the foreign exchange component of the fluctuation from the operational component 
similarly  the impact of changes in our results from acquisitions that were not included in comparable prior periods is subtracted from the absolute change in results to allow for better comparability of results between periods 
non gaap measures we use also include net operating profit after tax nopat  which is used in the calculation of our after tax return on invested capital roic  which is discussed in detail below 
overview our results for reveal a mix of performances 
over the year  we saw our awp  construction and mp segments show significant improvement from the lowest levels experienced during however  our cranes segment weakened more than anticipated 
production schedules continued to increase in most of our businesses  resulting in higher manufacturing utilization and better absorption of fixed costs  which was a primary contributor to our year over year operating profit improvement 
in addition  the impact of restructuring activities continued to result in improved financial results  which we believe will continue going forward 
see note m restructuring and other charges in our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our restructuring activities  including the reasons  timing and costs associated with such actions 
for  our focus will continue to be on growth 
we continue to invest in developing markets 
we are building a new facility in brazil and have recently started production in our new chinese awp facility  as well as in our mp facility in india 
these are critical steps in our goal to manufacture in markets that are growing  and are expected to continue to grow  their non residential construction spending substantially 
in  our cranes and mp businesses also entered into new joint ventures in china 
in addition  we also invested approximately million in net additional financing receivables as part of our initiatives to provide solutions to our customers and help accelerate the growth of our businesses 
we expect to continue this trend into  with an anticipated million of net additional funding being used to expand tfs in key markets like china  in addition to continuing to support our base business activities 
we continue to have significant liquidity  which was  million at december  in october  we repaid the entire million principal amount of our term loans 
additionally  in january  we repaid the entire million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due notes 
we continue to research and analyze potential acquisition targets  however  it remains difficult to predict when appropriate transactions might present themselves 
our performance for was generally in line with our expectations  except for weaker than anticipated sales in the cranes business 
net sales increased approximately on a year over year basis and we incurred an operating loss of approximately million compared to an operating loss of approximately million in we continue to see an improving business environment  with backlog growing in three of our four segments when compared to levels  except for cranes  where all terrain and crawler cranes showed weakness 
for our awp business  stable demand and increasing fleet age are leading rental and utility customers to address equipment requirements as evidenced by recent orders 
furthermore  we have successfully captured additional market share in some developing markets and recent customer meetings have reinforced our confidence in an improving environment for awp in we sharply reduced operating losses in our construction segment compared to the prior year 
this segment undertook a significant restructuring and  while there are still a few challenges ahead  looks to be a turning point 
our construction segment is seeing positive demand from certain markets  such as central europe and brazil 
additionally  we expect that new product offerings  such as our skid steer loaders  will begin to favorably impact our results as we move through in contrast  our cranes segment experienced a challenging year 
we experienced a significant drop in net sales for our all terrain and crawler crane products with a recovery in rough terrain cranes 
and while we expect cranes results to improve as we move through the year  many of our large crane orders  both in mobile cranes and port equipment  will not ship until the latter part of we believe we are at the bottom of the business cycle for our cranes segment in north america  growing in developing markets  but uncertain about in europe 
our mp segment continued to gain momentum with new product launch successes and planned increases in production in our indian facility 
north american and european markets are recovering in line with expectations and the mining application for rock crushing equipment continued to provide demand in australia  primarily for coal 
we expect to reflect continued strengthening trends in awp  construction and mp 
in addition  we have seen a recent sequential upturn in order rates in our cranes business as we secured several large contracts in the fourth quarter of for longer term delivery schedules 
consequently  we expect net sales in of billion to billion  an increase of approximately from  and expect to generate income from operations in of million to million 
as a result  we expect earnings per share to be approximately to per share for based on an average share count of approximately million shares  excluding the impact of restructuring and unusual items 
we expect to incur a loss of approximately to per share  excluding the impact of restructuring and unusual items  in the first quarter of  with a return to profitability in the second quarter 
the estimated average share count includes shares that are contingently issuable upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes and assumes an estimated volume weighted average stock price of per share 
the mid and longer term expectations for terex remain unchanged 
we are building the business in each product category  both in developed and developing markets 
awp  construction and mp customers are optimistic for  and we expect the cranes business to reach its low point in although our port equipment business is showing increasing quotation activity  we still expect this business to report an operating loss in we continue to restructure this business and expect it to return to profitability in roic continues to be the unifying metric that we use to measure our operating performance 
roic measures how effectively we utilize the capital invested in our operations 
after tax roic is determined by dividing the sum of nopat as defined below for each of the previous four quarters by the average of the sum of total stockholders equity plus debt as defined below less cash and cash equivalents for the previous five quarters 
nopat  which is a non gaap measure  for each quarter is calculated by multiplying income loss from continuing and discontinued operations by a figure equal to one minus the effective tax rate of the company 
we believe that earnings from discontinued operations  as well as the net assets that comprise those operations invested capital  should be included in this calculation because it captures the financial returns on our capital allocation decisions for the measured periods 
furthermore  we believe that return on capital deployed in tfs does not represent management of our primary operations and  therefore  tfs assets and results from operations have been excluded from the calculation below 
additionally  we do not believe that the deferred gain on shares of bucyrus stock held from the sale of our mining business reflects our operations and  therefore  such deferred gain has been excluded from the calculation below 
the effective tax rate is equal to the provision for benefit from income taxes divided by income loss before income taxes for the respective quarter 
debt is calculated using the amounts for notes payable and current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  less current portion 
we calculate roic using the last four quarters nopat as this represents the most recent month period at any given point of determination 
in order for the denominator of the roic ratio to properly match the operational period reflected in the numerator  we include the average of five quarters ending balance sheet amounts so that the denominator includes the average of the opening through ending balances on a quarterly basis over the same time period as the numerator four quarters of average invested capital 
terex management and the board of directors use roic as one of the primary measures to assess operational performance  including in connection with certain compensation programs 
we use roic as a unifying metric because we believe that it measures how effectively we invest our capital and provides a better measure to compare ourselves to peer companies to assist in assessing how we drive operational improvement 
we believe that roic measures return on the amount of capital invested in our primary businesses excluding tfs  as opposed to another metric such as return on stockholders equity that only incorporates book equity  and is thus a more accurate and descriptive measure of our performance 
we also believe that adding debt less cash and cash equivalents to total stockholders equity provides a better comparison across similar businesses regarding total capitalization  and roic highlights the level of value creation as a percentage of capital invested 
consistent with this belief  we use roic in evaluating executive performance and compensation  as we have disclosed in the compensation discussion and analysis in our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders 
in  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge for goodwill of million  which represented all of the goodwill recorded in the construction segment and all of the goodwill originally in the utilities reporting unit  which is now part of the awp segment 
however  we do not believe that non cash impairment charges are indicative of returns on our invested capital 
therefore  we have excluded the effect of these impairment charges from the metrics used in our calculation of roic 
as the tables below show  our roic at december  was negative  up from negative at december   mainly due to improved operating earnings and cash flow from operations in recent periods 
the amounts described below are reported in millions of us dollars  except for the effective tax rates

gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in higher manufacturing utilization and the effect of prior cost reduction efforts contributed approximately million to the year over year improvement 
lower restructuring charges  when compared with the prior year period  favorably impacted results by approximately million 
additionally  lower inventory charges in the current year period of approximately million contributed to the increase in gross profit 
sg a costs decreased by million when compared to the same period in sg a costs in awp and construction decreased 
sg a costs in mp were essentially flat and increased in cranes 
prior cost reduction activities lowered general and administrative costs by approximately million 
the decrease was also due to lower restructuring charges of approximately million when compared with the prior year period  as well as million recorded in the prior year period for the settlement of certain sec matters 
the lower sg a costs were partially offset by approximately million from the impact of acquisitions in loss from operations decreased by million for the year ended december  versus the comparable period in the decrease was due to the items noted above  particularly improved net sales volume  improved manufacturing utilization  the effect of prior cost reductions and lower sg a costs 
aerial work platforms of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales for the awp segment for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in while rental customers in the north american and european markets continued to age their aerial fleets and generally deferred the purchase of new products  selective buying patterns began to emerge 
additionally  it appears that the reduction of inventory at rental locations slowed 
developing markets remained a strong growth component for the awp segment as demand for large booms  light towers and telehandlers continued to steadily improve in markets such as south america and australia 
we also sold a portion of the segment s utility rental fleet 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in the favorable impact of higher manufacturing utilization and prior manufacturing cost reduction actions improved results by approximately million 
lower restructuring costs and inventory write downs favorably affected gross profit by approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million due to the negative impact from the mix of products sold 
net transactional foreign currency losses negatively impacted results by approximately million compared to the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in cost control efforts  including prior period restructuring actions  lowered sg a spending by approximately million as compared to the prior year period 
additionally  the allocation of corporate expenses was lower by approximately million in the current year compared to the prior year 
income loss from operations for the year ended december  improved million when compared to the same period in the improvement was due to the items noted above  particularly higher net sales  higher manufacturing utilization  prior manufacturing cost reductions and lower sg a costs 
construction of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit loss sg a loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales in the construction segment increased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the improvement in net sales was driven by a broad based recovery from trough levels in in most product categories and across most regions 
material handlers sales increased significantly and the off highway truck business experienced an increase in order and quotation activities  aided by strong demand from latin american markets 
the compact construction equipment business experienced good order demand  including increased demand for the compact track loader product in north america and undercarriage components supplied to another major manufacturer 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in the favorable impact of increased sales activities  lower material costs and prior cost reduction actions improved operating results by approximately million 
manufacturing utilization improved gross profit when compared to the prior year period by approximately million 
additionally  approximately million of lower restructuring and inventory charges in the current period contributed to the increase in gross profit 
other cost of sales including warranty  transactional foreign currency and product liability expenses were lower by approximately million in the current period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in cost control efforts  including prior period restructuring actions  lowered sg a spending by approximately million as compared to the prior year period 
additionally  the allocation of corporate expenses was lower by approximately million in the current year period 
lower restructuring charges of approximately million when compared to the prior year period also contributed to the decrease in sg a costs 
loss from operations for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the decrease was due to the items noted above  particularly improved net sales  better manufacturing utilization and lower sg a costs 
cranes of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the cranes segment for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in demand for lower capacity crane products  including the lower end of the all terrain product category  continued to weaken in as compared to the prior year period  as commercial construction demand remained soft 
the cranes segment also experienced weakening demand for our crawler crane products in tower crane and rough terrain crane demand remained stable  albeit at low levels 
this lower demand more than offset the increased net sales due to acquisitions 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in lower net sales  partially offset by the mix of larger cranes in the production schedule and the impact of reduced materials cost  negatively impacted profitability by approximately million  excluding acquisitions 
manufacturing utilization improved gross profit when compared to the prior year period by approximately million 
the full year impact of acquisitions in also contributed approximately million to gross profit 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million versus the same period in the increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions  offset in part by a decrease in the allocation of corporate costs from the prior year period and improvement from prior cost reduction activities 
income from operations for the year ended december  decreased million versus the same period in  resulting primarily from lower net sales volume and approximately million from the impact of acquisitions  partially offset by improved manufacturing utilization 
as of october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for the cranes segment  which resulted in the fair market value of the cranes reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by 
while no evidence of impairment was indicated  due to uncertainty and short term volatility in the cranes market  we reviewed the cranes reporting unit at december  to determine if the results of the october test would be significantly different 
we did not find evidence of impairment at december   but we will continue to monitor the performance of the cranes reporting unit and update the test as circumstances warrant 
if the cranes reporting unit is unable to achieve its projected cash flows  the outcome of any prospective tests may result in recording goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
the amount of goodwill in the cranes segment was million as of december  materials processing of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales in the mp segment increased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in demand for materials processing equipment has increased as dealers have generally stopped reducing their inventory and are generally now ordering in concert with end market demand 
additionally  markets such as australia and south america are showing favorable signs of growth driven by both mining and infrastructure activities 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million when compared to the same period in the increase in net sales  combined with the impact of lower material costs and pricing actions  positively affected profitability by approximately million when compared with the prior year period 
other favorable variances in the period included volume driven improved manufacturing utilization of approximately million compared with the prior year period 
lower foreign currency losses positively impacted results by approximately million compared to the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million over the same period in  primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs associated with trade shows  partially offset by reduced restructuring charges and a decrease in the allocation of corporate costs from the prior year period 
income loss from operations for the year ended december  improved million when compared to  primarily due to the items noted above  particularly higher net sales volume and improved manufacturing utilization 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales loss from operations net sales amounts include the elimination of intercompany sales activity among segments 
loss from operations increased primarily from the impact of a lower allocation to the business segments of corporate expenses and higher costs associated with stock based compensation and other benefits  partially offset by lower costs as a result of previous restructuring activities and expense related to the sec settlement in interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million higher than the prior year 
higher debt levels resulting from our capital markets activity executed in june combined with acquisition related debt incurred in july increased interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million when compared to the prior year period 
additionally  accelerated amortization related to the redemption of the notes increased interest expense by approximately million 
interest income increased by approximately million compared to the prior year period  reflecting cash balances in jurisdictions with higher return rates 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recorded a pre tax charge for early extinguishment of debt of million in the year ended december  for expense associated with the accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs in connection with the repayment of all of our outstanding term debt on october  other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was expense of million  an increase of million when compared to income of million in the prior year 
this was primarily due to a loss of approximately million associated with marking to market the derivative contracts intended to partially mitigate the risks associated with shares of common stock of bucyrus acquired in connection with the mining business divestiture 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to an income tax benefit of million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the lower effective tax rate recorded in was principally attributable to the recognition of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets  the decision to carry back the us tax net operating loss and changes in the jurisdictional mix of income 
the decrease in loss from continuing operations before income tax for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  causes items of income tax expense and benefit in to have a more significant impact on the effective tax rate than in when a loss from continuing operations before income tax instead of income from continuing operations before income tax is reported  tax expense items decrease the effective tax rate and tax benefit items increase the effective tax rate 
loss income from discontinued operations we had losses from discontinued operations for the year ended december  primarily due to the results of the atlas business prior to divestiture 
in the year ended december   we had income from discontinued operations primarily from the mining business offset  in part  by losses in the atlas business 
gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations for the year ended december   we recognized a gain  net of tax on the sale of the mining business  partially offset by a loss  net of tax on the sale of the atlas and powertrain businesses 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss  net of tax on the sale of the construction trailer business 
in addition  we incurred a loss  net of tax related to transaction costs incurred with the disposition of the mining business 
compared with terex consolidated of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment loss income from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales for the year ended december  decreased  million when compared to the same period in the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes contributed approximately million to the net sales decrease 
excluding the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  net sales in all segments declined by approximately  million from the prior year period  primarily as uncertainty about the global economy caused customers to defer purchasing equipment 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased  million when compared to the same period in the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased gross profit by approximately million from the prior year period 
excluding the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  the impact of lower net sales volume decreased gross profit by approximately  million 
charges  primarily related to production level and headcount reductions  decreased gross profit by approximately million 
sg a costs decreased by million when compared to the same period in approximately million of the decrease was due to the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
sg a costs in all of the segments decreased by approximately million due mainly to curtailment of spending and cost reductions 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of charges related to headcount reductions 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of our annual goodwill impairment test  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for goodwill of million 
there were no indicators of goodwill impairment in the test performed as of october  income loss from operations decreased by million for the year ended december  versus the comparable period in the decrease was due to the items noted above  particularly lower net sales volume  and higher costs due to lower production levels and headcount reductions  partially offset by lower sg a costs 
aerial work platforms of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment loss income from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales for the awp segment for the year ended december  decreased  million when compared to the same period in lower net sales volume of approximately  million in the north american  asia pacific and european markets primarily drove the decrease in net sales 
the lower net sales volume was primarily due to rental customers aging their fleets and deferring purchases of new products  particularly for mid size booms  scissor lifts and telehandlers 
the core markets for aerials in north america and europe remained at very depressed levels 
the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately million of the net sales decrease 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the impact of lower net sales volume decreased gross profit by approximately million 
charges  primarily associated with reductions in production levels and restructuring  reduced gross profit by approximately million 
the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased gross profit by approximately million from the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in cost reduction activities accounted for the majority of the decrease 
the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes also decreased sg a costs by approximately million over the prior year period 
income loss from operations for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in  resulting primarily from lower net sales volume and higher costs due to lower production levels  partially offset by lower sg a costs and the goodwill impairment charge in the goodwill impairment charge in  related to the utility products business that is now within this segment 
construction of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross loss profit sg a goodwill impairment loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales in the construction segment decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in lower machine sales volumes of approximately million were largely responsible for the decrease in net sales 
demand for both compact and heavy construction products remained weak during  as construction activity continued to slow globally and commercial financing availability for projects and equipment remained tight 
additionally  lower parts  used equipment and other sales volumes decreased net sales by approximately million 
the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the impact of lower net sales volume decreased gross profit by approximately million 
the impact of reductions in production levels and restructuring charges decreased gross profit by approximately million 
this decrease was mostly offset by cost reduction activities initiated early in  which lowered manufacturing and other direct costs compared to the same period in sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased sg a costs by approximately million over the prior year period 
reductions in spending and cost savings associated with headcount reductions lowered sg a costs by approximately million 
these reductions were partially offset by increased restructuring costs of approximately million 
excluding impairment charges of million incurred in  the loss from operations for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in  resulting primarily from lower net sales volume and higher costs due to lower production levels  partially offset by lower sg a costs 
including goodwill impairment  the loss from operations decreased million in compared to cranes of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the cranes segment for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on sales more than offset the additional net sales relating to the port equipment business and led to a net decrease in net sales of approximately million 
lower net sales volume  particularly for tower cranes and rough terrain cranes  decreased net sales by approximately  million  as global commercial construction projects continued to slow and oil related energy demand for rough terrain cranes remained soft 
this decrease was partially offset by approximately million of increased sales volume of higher priced crawler and all terrain cranes 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in lower net sales volume decreased gross profit by approximately million 
this was partially offset by approximately million from improved sales of higher margin crawler and all terrain cranes 
the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased gross profit by approximately million from the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million versus the same period in the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased sg a costs by approximately million over the prior year period 
additionally  selling  marketing  engineering and other general administrative costs decreased by approximately million 
these were partially offset by increased costs for terex port equipment and restructuring costs of approximately million 
income from operations for the year ended december  decreased million versus the same period in  resulting primarily from lower net sales volume 
materials processing of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a loss income from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales in the mp segment decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to lower net sales volume across substantially all product lines in all markets of approximately million was primarily responsible for the decrease in net sales 
the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes also decreased net sales by approximately million 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in lower net sales volume decreased gross profit by approximately million 
the impact of reductions in production levels and restructuring charges decreased gross profit by approximately million 
additionally  due to lower production levels  net manufacturing unabsorbed overhead increased  resulting in a reduction to gross profit of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximate million increase in gross profit from improvement in other costs  primarily due to reduced material input costs 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million over the same period in the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased sg a costs by approximately million over the prior year period 
reductions in spending and cost savings associated with prior headcount reductions lowered sg a costs by approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of costs associated with restructuring activities 
income loss from operations for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to  resulting primarily from lower net sales volume and higher costs due to lower production levels  partially offset by lower sg a costs 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales loss from operations our consolidated results include the elimination of intercompany sales activity among segments 
loss from operations decreased approximately million due to the favorable impact of cost reduction activities  including salary and benefit cuts and reduced external fees 
these decreases were partially offset by the reduction in the allocation of corporate costs to the business segments of approximately million and the sec settlement charge of million 
additionally  increased spending in developing markets administrative infrastructure and restructuring charges increased costs by approximately million 
interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million higher than the prior year 
this increase was primarily related to higher interest expense due to increased debt balances resulting from the capital markets activity in and acquisition related debt incurred in connection with the port equipment business purchase  as well as lower interest income due to lower interest rates 
other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was income of million  an increase of million when compared to expense of million in the prior year 
this was primarily due to currency translation gains in the current year period compared with losses in the prior year period 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million on loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the lower tax rate for the year ended december  was primarily due to the changes in the provision for uncertain tax positions  the port equipment business acquisition and related acquisition expenses for which no tax benefit was recognized  the tax treatment of the sec settlement charges and the impact in of non tax deductible goodwill impairment 
as earnings decrease in profitable periods  the items that affect income tax expense have a more significant impact on the effective tax rate 
when the results are losses instead of profits  the effect of items on the tax rate have an opposite impact 
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in  resulting primarily from lower net sales volume and higher costs due to lower production levels  partially offset by lower sg a costs 
loss on disposition of discontinued operations for the year ended december   we incurred a loss  net of tax on the sale of the construction trailer business of million 
in addition  we incurred a loss  net of tax related to transaction costs incurred with the disposition of the mining business of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on our financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are among our most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a basis of presentation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out fifo method and the average cost method approximately and  respectively 
in valuing inventory  we are required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions require us to analyze the aging of and forecasted demand for our inventory  forecast future products sales prices  pricing trends and margins  and to make judgments and estimates regarding obsolete or excess inventory 
future product sales prices  pricing trends and margins are based on the best available information at that time including actual orders received  negotiations with our customers for future orders  including their plans for expenditures  and market trends for similar products 
our judgments and estimates for excess or obsolete inventory are based on analysis of actual and forecasted usage 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires us to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where our products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  actions of our competitors  including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes we introduce 
we make adjustments to our inventory reserve based on the identification of specific situations and increase our inventory reserves accordingly 
as further changes in future economic or industry conditions occur  we will revise the estimates that were used to calculate its inventory reserves 
at december   reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
if actual conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  we will increase our reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory accordingly 
any increase in our reserves will adversely impact our results of operations 
the establishment of a reserve for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory establishes a new cost basis in the inventory 
such reserves are not reduced until the product is sold 
accounts receivable we are required to judge our ability to collect accounts receivable from our customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical accounts receivable collection experience will be indicative of future results 
guarantees we have issued guarantees to financial institutions of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  we must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks  and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
our customers  from time to time  may fund acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh  part of the cranes segment  and genie holdings  inc and its affiliates genie  part of the awp segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
there can be no assurance that our historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note r litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are generally able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by genie of million 
we are generally able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we record a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  guarantees asc 
we recognize a loss under a guarantee when our obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if our payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value we could expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  there can be no assurances that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
revenue recognition revenue and related costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers  which occurs upon shipment when terms are fob shipping point which is customary and upon delivery when terms are fob destination 
we also have a policy requiring that certain criteria be met in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d we have no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  we have the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  we retain title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that we can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where we only retain title to secure our recovery in the event of customer default  we also have a policy  which requires meeting certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e we have no significant obligations for future performance  and f we are not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and have no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or we have otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  we analyze factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
we routinely sell equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if we do not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if we do retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 
we  from time to time  issue buyback guarantees in conjunction with certain sales agreements 
these primarily relate to trade value agreements tvas in which a customer may trade in equipment in the future at a stated price credit if the customer meets certain conditions 
the trade in price credit is determined at the time of the original sale of equipment 
in conjunction with the trade in  these conditions include a requirement to purchase new equipment at fair market value at the time of trade in  which fair value is required to be of equal or greater value than the original equipment cost 
other conditions also include the general functionality and state of repair of the machine 
we have concluded that any credit provided to customers under a tva buyback guarantee  which is expected to be equal to or less than the fair value of the equipment returned on the trade in date  is a guarantee to be accounted for in accordance with asc the original sale of equipment  accompanied by a buyback guarantee  is a multiple element transaction wherein we offer our customer the right  after some period of time  for a limited period of time  to exchange purchased equipment for a fixed price trade in credit toward another of our products 
the fixed price trade in credit is accounted for under the guidance provided by asc pursuant to this right  we have agreed to make a payment in the form of a trade in credit to the customer contingent upon the customer exercising its right to trade in the original purchased equipment 
under the guidance of asc  we record the fixed price trade in credit at its fair value 
accordingly  as noted above  we have accounted for the trade in credit as a separate deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
goodwill goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
we selected october as the date for our required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by our management 
our four operating segments comprise the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use an income approach derived from the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units is compared to our market capitalization on the valuation date to assess its reasonableness 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that we develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the discounted cash flow model also includes a determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by our equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
there were no indicators of goodwill impairment in the tests performed as of october  and as a result of our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  our construction and awp segments recorded non cash charges of million and million  respectively  to reflect impairment of goodwill in these reporting units  which represented all of the goodwill recorded in the construction segment and all of the goodwill originally in the utilities reporting unit  which is now part of the awp segment  see note j goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would still result in excess fair value over carrying value for the reporting units as of october  impairment of long lived assets our policy is to assess the realizability of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
we use data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
we did not have any impairment for the year ended december  however  we recognized fixed asset impairments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was recognized as part of restructuring costs 
see note m restructuring and other charges 
accrued warranties we record accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on our claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability we record accruals for product liability claims when deemed probable and estimable based on facts and circumstances and our prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon our prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of our product safety team 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
defined benefit plans pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   we maintained one qualified defined benefit pension plan and one nonqualified plan covering certain us employees 
the benefits covering salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation during the final years of employment 
the benefits covering bargaining unit employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
participation in the qualified plan is frozen and participants are only credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility 
it is our policy  generally  to fund the qualified us plan based on the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the nonqualified plan provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company and is unfunded 
generally  the nonqualified plan provides a benefit based on average total compensation earned over a participant s final five years of employment and years of service reduced by benefits earned under any company retirement program  excluding salary deferrals and matching contributions 
in addition  benefits are reduced by social security primary insurance amounts attributable to company contributions 
participation in the nonqualified plan was frozen effective december   however  eligible participants are credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and the amount of benefits 
we maintain defined benefit plans in germany  france  china  india and the united kingdom for some of our subsidiaries 
the plans in germany  france  india and china are unfunded plans 
during  the plan in the united kingdom was frozen 
for our operations in italy  there are mandatory termination indemnity plans providing a benefit that is payable upon termination of employment in substantially all cases of termination 
we record this obligation based on the mandated requirements 
the measure of the current obligation is not dependent on the employees future service and therefore is measured at current value 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the uk funded plan  approximately of the assets are in equity securities  are in fixed income securities and are in real estate investment securities 
these allocations are reviewed periodically and updated to meet the long term goals of the plans 
determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
we use the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions  including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
the assumptions used in the actuarial models are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
we believe the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for the us plan and for the united kingdom plan at december  our strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plans is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and to with a weighted average of for non us plans at december  the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
typically  a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for our non us pension plans were to with a weighted average of at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
we have recorded the underfunded status on our balance sheet as a liability and the unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains losses as a reduction in stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
the change in assumptions from the previous year  primarily decreases in the discount rate offset by the effect of the plan freeze in the united kingdom  resulted in a net increase in the projected benefit obligation of million 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of plan benefit obligations is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plans estimated benefit obligations could increase  causing an increase in liabilities and a reduction in stockholders equity 
we expect that any future obligations under our plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if our contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  or if the performance of the assets in our plans does not meet expectations  or if our assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected  which would reduce the cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could require the recording of additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
the assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u 
s 
plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation non us plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes we estimate income taxes based on enacted tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent future tax benefits or obligations of our legal entities 
these deferred income tax balances arise from temporary differences due to divergent treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the use of our deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type capital gain vs 
ordinary income as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income we generate 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated 
timing is important because net operating losses nols in certain jurisdictions expire if not used within an established statutory time frame 
based on these evaluations  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future earnings will be sufficient to use most of our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings or losses of our non us subsidiaries where such earnings are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
if earnings of foreign subsidiaries are not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us income taxes  foreign income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes may have to be provided 
we do not record deferred income taxes on the temporary difference between the book and tax basis in domestic subsidiaries where permissible 
at this time  determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the investment in subsidiaries is not practical 
judgments and estimates are required to determine tax expense and deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions we take 
our practice is to file income tax returns that conform to the requirements of each jurisdiction and to record provisions for tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  in accordance with asc  income taxes 
as our business has grown in geographic scope  size and complexity  so has our potential exposure to uncertain tax positions 
given the subjective nature of applicable tax laws  the results of an audit of any tax return could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance related to the transfers of financial assets  which has been codified under asc  transfers and servicing 
this guidance requires entities to provide more information about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  with transferred financial assets 
it requires additional disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
it also eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and will change the requirements for de recognition of financial assets 
this guidance is effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning on and after january  adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued guidance amending the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities  which has been codified under asc  consolidations 
it replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative and requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
it also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
this guidance is effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning on and after january  adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amended asc  revenue recognition 
this guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how to allocate the consideration to each unit of accounting 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items have value on a stand alone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a stand alone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
arrangement consideration shall be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price  except under certain circumstances such as items recorded at fair value and items not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists for a deliverable  then the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
this guidance eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining allocation of arrangement consideration and it allows for the use of an entity s best estimate to determine the selling price if vsoe and third party evidence cannot be determined 
it also requires additional disclosures such as the nature of the arrangement  certain provisions within the arrangement  significant factors used to determine selling prices and the timing of revenue recognition related to the arrangement 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect that adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary a scope clarification  which amends asc  consolidations 
this amendment requires new disclosures  including a description of valuation techniques and inputs used to measure the fair value of any retained investment in a former subsidiary  the nature of any continuing involvement in the subsidiary or acquirer after deconsolidation and information regarding related party involvement before and after the transaction 
this guidance was effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment requires new disclosures  including the reasons for and amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of activity for level fair value measurements 
it also clarified guidance related to determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities and the information to be provided for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this guidance with respect to significant transfers in and out of levels and was effective for the company in its interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this portion of the guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
this guidance with respect to level fair value measurements is effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect that adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendments in this update clarify the acquisition date that should be used for reporting the pro forma financial information disclosures in topic when comparative financial statements are presented 
the amendments also improve the usefulness of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures by requiring a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination s 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not expect that adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
liquidity and capital resources our main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from our bank credit facilities and funds raised in capital markets 
we have significant liquidity because of the divestiture of our mining business  our capital raising activities and the working capital reductions accomplished in we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in addition  our bank credit facilities provide us with a revolving line of credit of up to million that is available through july  the revolving line of credit consists of million of available domestic revolving loans and million of available multicurrency revolving loans 
we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities at december  on october   we repaid term loan debt of million and on january   we repaid the entire million principal amount of our outstanding notes  which was consistent with our previously stated intent to use a portion of the mining business proceeds for retirement of debt 
the credit facilities also provide for incremental loan commitments of up to million  which may be extended at the option of the lenders  in the form of revolving credit loans  term loans or a combination of both 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with access to our bank credit facilities and cash on hand  provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements 
we expect our liquidity to provide us with flexibility to put our cash to work to yield higher returns and accelerate growth as well as to be opportunistic on acquisitions 
in addition  we plan to monetize the million shares of bucyrus stock we currently hold 
we may monetize these shares either through open market sales  tendering to caterpillar in connection with caterpillar s offer to acquire all shares of bucyrus stock for consideration of per share in cash  or a combination of both 
the market value of these shares at december  was approximately million 
we continue to evaluate acquisition targets  but it remains difficult to predict the timing of potential transactions 
in october  we amended our bank credit facilities  which among other things  removed the previous million annual limitation on acquisitions 
during  many of our businesses operated at production levels below then current demand as we focused on reducing inventory 
in  our production schedules generally increased and we are now building many of our products in quantities generally consistent with end user demand 
we expect increasing demand during will be matched by higher production rates 
our focus is on growth and many of our manufacturing locations have increased production as demand has increased 
we are redeploying our cash in areas where we see a potential for high return or accelerated growth and market presence  such as developing markets and internal improvement initiatives 
we are building a new facility in brazil and recently started production in our new awp factory in china and our mp facility in india 
in  our cranes and mp businesses entered into joint ventures in china 
we have also increased end customer financing through tfs and look to continue this trend in with an anticipated million of additional funding being used to expand tfs in key markets like china  in addition to continuing to support our base business activities 
we have made and will continue to make selective investments in inventory for businesses that are showing improved order and inquiry activity 
the cash impact of these investments were largely reflected in increased inventory as we purchased additional materials from suppliers as we position our businesses for the anticipated market recovery 
we are continuing our long standing program to increase inventory turns by sharing  throughout our company  many of the best practices and lean manufacturing processes that several of our business units have implemented successfully 
we expect these initiatives to reduce the level of inventory needed to support our business and allow us to reduce our manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to numerous factors  including the following many of our customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies that extend credit based on the credit worthiness of the customers and the expected residual value of our equipment 
changes either in the customers credit profile or used equipment values may affect the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
there can be no assurance that third party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers as they have in the past 
we have become more active in providing end customer financing through tfs  which will result in an increasing use of cash as our financing portfolio grows 
as our sales levels change  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support our business may change 
our suppliers extend payment terms to us based on our overall credit rating 
declines in our credit rating may influence suppliers willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business 
sales of our products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition and the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and other factors that in many cases are outside our direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  our customers have delayed purchasing decisions  which has had a negative impact on cash generated from operations 
we negotiate  when possible  advance payments from our customers for products with long lead times to help fund the substantial working capital investment in these products 
to help fund our cash expenditures  we have maintained cash balances and a revolving line of credit from our bank group as described above 
although we believe that the banks participating in our credit facilities have adequate capital and resources  we can provide no assurance that each of these banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future 
if any banks in our lending group were to fail  it is possible that the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities would be reduced 
if our cash balances and the availability under our credit facilities were reduced significantly  we might need to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to finance our capital needs  but there can be no assurance that such financing would be available at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
typically  we have invested our cash in a combination of highly rated  liquid money market funds and in short term bank deposits with large  highly rated banks 
our investment objective is to preserve capital and liquidity while earning a market rate of interest 
in  we used a portion of our cash balance to take advantage of early payment discounts offered by our suppliers where the returns were greater than the amount that would have been earned on such cash if invested in money market funds and short term bank deposits 
we expect this practice to continue in  although we may discontinue this practice at any time 
the interest rates charged under our bank credit facilities are subject to adjustment based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and no outstanding term loan debt at december  we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt  including the use of interest rate derivatives when appropriate 
over the long term  we believe this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix while reducing interest rate risk 
the revolving line of credit under our bank facilities expires in july our convertible senior subordinated notes mature in june  our senior notes notes mature in june and our senior subordinated notes notes mature in november see note l long term obligations  in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
upon the closing of the sale of the mining business  we received from bucyrus cash proceeds of approximately billion and  shares of bucyrus common stock 
the sale of our mining business constitutes an asset sale under various agreements governing our debt and the use of the net cash proceeds from the sale was subject to certain restrictions 
in june  we obtained a waiver from the holders of our notes with respect to the use of the proceeds from the mining divestiture 
the holders waived their rights to an offer at par for the notes with the net cash proceeds from the mining divestiture even if such proceeds have not been reinvested within days following the mining divestiture 
we offered to purchase at par the notes and the notes with a portion of proceeds from the mining business divestiture 
pursuant to these offers  in november  we repaid approximately thousand and million  respectively  of these notes 
the remaining cash from the mining divestiture is currently available for general corporate purposes 
the shares of bucyrus common stock we received are not considered net cash proceeds and will not be subject to reinvestment or debt repayment obligations unless and until such time as we sell those shares 
when the shares of bucyrus common stock are sold we either must reinvest the net cash proceeds we receive from the sale of the stock into our business within days of the consummation of the sale of the stock pursuant to our bank credit agreement or within days after the sale of the stock pursuant to the indentures for our outstanding notes or use the proceeds to repay indebtedness 
the priority of debt repayments is prescribed by the terms of our various debt agreements 
any remaining net cash proceeds would be used to make offers at par for our outstanding notes in the order provided in the note indentures 
the holders of our notes have waived their rights to an offer to purchase at par for up to million in cash proceeds received upon disposition of the bucyrus common stock after paying taxes and fees  even if such proceeds have not been reinvested during the day periods following the date or dates of the company s sales of shares of bucyrus common stock 
our ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to us  and others related to general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
our ability to access the capital markets is also subject to our timely filing of periodic reports with the sec 
in addition  the terms of our bank credit facilities  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on our ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of our assets 
as a result of our settlement with the sec and final court decree in august  for a period of three years  or such earlier time as we are able to obtain a waiver from the sec  i we are no longer qualified as a wksi as defined in rule of the securities act of  and cannot take advantage of the benefits available to a wksi  which include expedited registration and access to the capital markets  ii we cannot rely on the safe harbor provisions regarding forward looking statements provided by the regulations issued under the securities exchange act of  and iii we cannot utilize regulation a or d 
however  in november  we filed a billion multi security shelf registration statement with the sec to allow for easier access to the capital markets 
cash flows vs 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  the change in cash used in operations was primarily driven by the operating loss  additional cash used for working capital throughout and increased funding of financial services activity 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  the increase in cash from investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of the mining business in february cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  of million 
the change was primarily due to proceeds from the capital market issuances of debt and common stock in june and the repayment of term debt in contractual obligations the following table sets out our specified contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include non cancellable and cancellable commitments 
in many cases  cancellable commitments contain penalty provisions for cancellation 
long term debt obligations include expected interest expense 
interest expense is calculated using fixed interest rates for indebtedness that has fixed rates and the implied forward rates as of december  for indebtedness that has floating interest rates 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
with respect to our tax audits worldwide  it is reasonably possible that we will make payments in of up to million 
payments may be made in part to mitigate the accrual of interest in connection with income tax audit assessments that may be issued and that we would contest  or may in part be made to settle the matter with the tax authorities 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the remaining liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in credit guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment  million in residual value guarantees and million in buyback guarantees 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the retirement plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  we made cash contributions and payments to the retirement plans of million  and we estimate that our retirement plan contributions will be approximately million in changes in market conditions  changes in our funding levels or actions by governmental agencies may result in accelerated funding requirements in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our customers  from time to time  may fund the acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of a customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total credit guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh  part of our cranes segment  and genie  part of our awp segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
there can be no assurance that historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue  from time to time  residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note r litigation and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are generally able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are generally able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  there can be no assurance that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
contingencies and uncertainties foreign currencies  interest rate and bucyrus stock risk our products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  our revenues are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which we do business are the euro and british pound 
we may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows or forecasted cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million 
we manage exposure to interest rates by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintaining an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
we have market risk with respect to the shares of bucyrus common stock we received in connection with the sale of our mining business to bucyrus 
bucyrus stock is traded on nasdaq and since the announcement of caterpillar s proposed acquisition in november  the stock of bucyrus has not been subject to significant price volatility 
if caterpillar s acquisition of bucyrus does not occur in as anticipated  the shares of bucyrus stock would likely become subject to substantial price fluctuation and volatility 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may have on our financial performance 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over the london interbank offered rate 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and amortized it through january   when we repaid the outstanding portion of the notes 
other we are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  intellectual property claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations  guarantees  class action lawsuits and the matters described above in item legal proceedings 
we are insured for product liability  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability  property damage  intellectual property and other insurable risk required by law or contract with retained liability to us or deductibles 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any of our costs 
however  we do not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
we generate hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
all of our employees are required to obey all applicable national  local or other health  safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations would also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances  should any of such events occur 
we are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment  machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards 
each of our facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every three years to monitor compliance and no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations 
we are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices  training and procedures 
three years ago  we made it a goal to reduce lost time injuries in the workplace by annually 
we have been able to successfully reach and exceed this three year target 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
see note k derivative financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus functional currencies of our major markets  which include the euro and british pound 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows  identify naturally offsetting positions and purchase hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately million 
the fair market value of these arrangements  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  was a net loss of million at december  at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on the effect that aggregate changes in the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes would have on our operating income 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies outside the us by to amounts already incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended december  would not have significantly affected the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes already included in our reported operating income in interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposure includes movements in the us prime rate and libor 
we manage interest rate risk by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintain an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness through the use of interest rate swaps when necessary 
at december   approximately of our debt was floating rate debt and the weighted average interest rate for all debt was 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and amortized it through january   which was the effective date that the hedged debt was extinguished 
at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis for our derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
we calculated the pre tax earnings effect on our interest sensitive instruments 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase of in our average floating interest rates at december  would have increased interest expense by approximately million in commodities risk principal materials and components that we use in our various manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulics  cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
extreme movements in the cost and availability of these materials and components may affect our financial performance 
there is a strong potential for increases in prices in tires and certain components  as well as steel and other commodities in general during we have been working effectively with our suppliers to provide additional visibility into our production plans and we have had only limited shortages that we generally have been able to work around 
our supply chain has generally stayed aligned with our requirements  which we expect will continue in in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials and components are normally available from multiple suppliers 
however  certain of our businesses receive materials and components from a single source supplier  although alternative suppliers of such materials may be generally available 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
we actively manage our material supply sourcing  and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
the inability of suppliers  especially any single source suppliers for a particular business  to deliver materials and components promptly could result in production delays and increased costs to manufacture our products 
we have designed and implemented plans to mitigate the impact of these risks by using alternate suppliers  expanding our supply base to include asian suppliers  leveraging our overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable quantities and developing a closer working relationship with key suppliers 
we continue to search for acceptable alternative supply sources and less expensive supply options on a regular basis  including improving the globalization of our supply base and using suppliers in china and india 
one key terex initiative has been developing and implementing world class capability in supply chain management  logistics and global purchasing 
we are focusing on gaining efficiencies with suppliers based on our global purchasing power and resources
