item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition for a discussion of the restructuring charges related to fiscal   and the company s impairment testing is performed on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company recorded a  goodwill impairment charge in accordance with asc topic during the fourth quarter of fiscal refer to item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 
during  the company recorded non cash charge of  included within its provision for income taxes 
the majority of this charge relates to the company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the u 
s is necessary 
accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment 
if a cumulative loss threshold is met  the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations  except in the section entitled discontinued operations 
executive overview we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer and marketer of material handling products  systems and services which efficiently and safely move  lift  position or secure material 
key products include hoists  actuators  cranes and lifting and rigging tools 
the company is focused on commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality provided by its superior design and engineering know how 
founded in  we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions 
we developed our leading market position over our year history by emphasizing technological innovation  manufacturing excellence and superior after sale service 
in addition  acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
ongoing initiatives include improving our productivity and increasing penetration of the asian  latin american and european marketplaces 
in accordance with our strategy  we have been investing in our directed sales and marketing activities  new product development and lean efforts across the company 
shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on improvement of the fundamentals including market expansion  a high degree of customer satisfaction  new product development  manufacturing efficiency  cost containment  and efficient capital investment 
over the course of our history  we have managed through many business cycles and our strong cash flow profile has helped us grow and expand globally 
we stand with a strong capital structure which includes sufficient cash reserves  significant revolver availability with an expiration of may  fixed rate long term debt which expires in and a strong cash flow business profile 
we believe our liquidity strength and operational cost management actions have enabled us to withstand the recent global economic downturn 
during fiscal we initiated projects to strategically reorganize our north american hoist and rigging operations  which were essentially completed during the first quarter of fiscal the projects included the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility 
the closures and downsizing resulted in a reduction of approximately  square feet of manufacturing space or approximately of total manufacturing space and we expect to generate annual savings estimated at approximately  additionally our revenue base is now more geographically diverse than at any time in our company s history  with approximately derived from customers outside the us in fiscal we believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in different global economies at different times 
as in the past  we monitor both us and eurozone industrial capacity utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our product 
since their june trough  these statistics have consistently improved through april in addition  we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and us trends including industrial production  energy costs  steel price fluctuations  interest rates  currency exchange and activity of end user markets around the globe 
from a strategic perspective  we are investing in global markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth 
we maintain a strong north american market share with significant leading market positions in hoists  lifting and sling chain  forged attachments and actuators 
we seek to maintain and enhance our market share by continuing and focusing our sales and marketing activities directed toward select north american and global market sectors including energy  construction  entertainment  mining and food processing 
our fiscal acquisition of pfaff is enhancing our european market penetration as well as strengthening our global actuator offering 
further  we continue to invest in emerging market penetration  including the geographic regions of asia  latin america  and eastern europe 
we complement these activities with continued investments in new product development  particularly products with global reach 
regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle  we constantly explore ways to manage our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness 
we have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction  reduction of defects  shortened lead times  improved inventory turns and on time deliveries  reduction of warranty costs  and improved working capital utilization 
the initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our lean efforts which are fundamentally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on time delivery and productivity 
in addition to lean  we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification  the creation of centers of excellence  and improved supply chain management 
we continuously monitor market prices of steel 
we purchase approximately  to  of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
generally  as we experience fluctuations in our costs  we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral 
some of our steel costs have increased during this quarter primarily with regards to forged bar as the result of higher scrap and alloy surcharges 
we are also looking for opportunities for growth via strategic acquisitions or joint ventures 
the focus of our acquisition strategy centers on opportunities for international market penetration and product line expansion in alignment with our existing core product offering 
we operate in a highly competitive and global business environment  and we are effectively managing through a global economic cycle 
we face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies  including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in asia and other emerging markets 
while we continue to execute our long term growth strategy  we have weathered the current economic cycle with our strong capital structure  including a solid cash position and flexible cost base  aggressively addressing costs and restructuring to enhance future margin opportunities 
results of operations fiscal sales were  up  or  compared with fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to an increase of  in volume resulting from the economic recovery and market share gains 
further  price increases resulted in a  increase in sales 
these increases were offset by a reduction of sales of  from the october divestiture of our american lifts business as well as a negative foreign currency impact of  in fiscal sales were  down  or  compared with fiscal our pfaff acquisition contributed  to our sales for fiscal with the remaining business being down  or  excluding pfaff 
the decline in sales was primarily due to volume decline resulting from the global economic slow down 
the divestiture of our american lift business as well as fewer shipping days also contributed to lower sales in fy by approximately  but was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact of approximately our gross profit was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in gross profit of  is the result of a  increase in volume  a  increase in restructuring benefits   increase in savings on us health and pension expenses  offset by a decrease of  from inefficiencies in our forgings operation  a decrease of  for increases in our product liability and asbestos related reserves  a decrease of  for increases in costs of materials  and freight and a decrease of  for currency translation  and other 
the fiscal decline in gross profit of  or compared with fiscal was mostly due to under absorption of costs due to lower volume in all markets 
restructuring charges related to factory consolidation of approximately  as well as a reserve related to an atypical product liability claim of  also contributed to lower margin in fiscal selling expenses were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
decreases in fiscal selling expense of  or are due to reorganization efforts specifically in the company s north american sales operations  partially offset by investments in non u 
s markets and commissions on higher sales 
decreases in fiscal selling expense of  or reflect aggressive efforts to reduce or eliminate costs as well as lower salaries  benefits and commissions by  on lower volume  offset by  in increased variable compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by  or primarily due to the company s investments in its management team in asia and new product development 
fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by  or primarily due to lower pension group health benefit costs  lower bad debt expense and other miscellaneous items  partially offset by increased variable compensation expense 
restructuring charges of   and  or  and of net sales were recorded in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal restructuring charges resulted from the consolidation of our north american sales force  early retirement benefits offered and costs associated with the closure and downsizing of manufacturing facilities 
restructuring charges for fiscal were less than restructuring charges in fiscal as the activities initiated in fiscal were essentially complete by the end of the first quarter in fiscal in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  per diluted share associated with goodwill 
based on impairment testing performed in february  we determined that impairment existed for goodwill related to our rest of products reporting unit 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 
there were no goodwill impairments in fiscal or fiscal amortization of intangibles was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively and primarily relate to amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our fiscal acquisition of pfaff 
interest and debt expense was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  interest and debt expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
we incurred costs of  in fiscal with none in fiscal and income of  in fiscal  related to the repurchase of outstanding debt 
further discussion on this topic is included below in the liquidity and capital resources section and note of our consolidated financial statements 
investment income loss of   and  in fiscal and  respectively  related to marketable securities held in the company s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
the fiscal  gain primarily is the result of the market recovery and sale of securities previously impaired in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded a  charge related to unrealized losses on securities that were determined to be other than temporary in nature 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on marketable securities and were included in other income expense 
foreign currency exchange loss gain was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  as a result of foreign currency volatility related to purchases and intercompany debt 
other income  net was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
other income in fiscal includes a gain from the sale of the american lifts business and a gain from the sale of an equity investment in europe 
income tax benefit expense as a percentage of loss income from continuing operations before income tax benefit expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the unusual percentage experienced during the year ended march  is related to the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of  the effective rate for fiscal was positively impacted by foreign tax benefits and from us state net operating loss benefits 
fiscal income from continuing operations was adjusted for the  impairment charge 
after excluding the impact of the  impairment charge  none of which is deductible for tax purposes  the effective tax rate for fiscal was liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totalled   and  at march   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the  decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to increase in cash used for working capital needed to fund the growing sales as well as completion of restructuring activities 
favorable changes in the net working capital effects on cash flows from operating activities included  in trade accounts payable  and  in accrued and other non current liabilities  partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable of  inventory of  and prepaid expenses and other assets of  net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal  a decrease of  compared to fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to lower operating performance on lower sales as a result of the continued weakness in the global economy as well as cash payments related to restructuring activities  partially offset by improved working capital management 
favorable changes  as compared to fiscal  in the net working capital effects on cash flows from operating activities included  in inventory   in trade accounts payable  and  in accrued and other non current liabilities  partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable of  and prepaid expenses and other assets of  net cash used by investing activities was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in cash used of  compared to fiscal was primarily the result of a  increase for capital expenditures which included  as the initial investment in our global enterprise resource planning system and a  decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets offset by a  increase in cash generated from the net sales of marketable securities in fiscal the fiscal decrease in cash used of  compared to fiscal was primarily the result of  of cash used in fiscal for the pfaff acquisition as well as lower capital expenditures in fiscal the fiscal  and amounts included   and  for capital expenditures 
the fiscal  and amounts benefited from   and  respectively  of proceeds from business  property and asset divestitures 
net cash generated by financing activities was  in fiscal compared with net cash used by financing activities of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in cash generated by financing activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the refinancing of the  outstanding notes with a new issuance of  notes 
offsetting the proceeds from the offering was  paid for tender and call redemption premiums on the notes and  paid for direct financing costs which have been deferred 
additional increases in cash from financing activities relate to  from the change in esop debt guarantee offset by  in net repayments under revolving lines of credit in fiscal the decrease in cash used by financing activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to less net debt repayment of  and  of payments by the company related to its divested business  univeyor in fiscal fiscal  and include   and  respectively  of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon successful execution of our current business plan which includes cost management  finalizing the facility consolidations and effective working capital utilization 
no material restrictions exist in accessing cash held by our non us subsidiaries 
additionally we expect to meet our us funding needs without repatriating non us cash and incurring the incremental non us taxes 
we entered into an amended  restated and expanded revolving credit facility dated december  the new revolving credit facility provides availability up to a maximum of  and expires december  provided there is no default  we may  on a one time basis  request an increase in the availability of the revolving credit facility by an amount not exceeding  subject to lender approval 
the unused portion of the revolving credit facility totalled  net of outstanding borrowings of and outstanding letters of credit of  as of march  the outstanding letters of credit at march  consisted of  in documentary letters of credit including a significant letter of credit related to a large customer order  amounting to  which will mature in april and  of standby letters of credit 
interest on the revolver is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor or prime plus a spread determined by our total leverage ratio amounting to or basis points  respectively  at march  the revolving credit facility is secured by all us inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to of non us subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the corresponding credit agreement associated with the revolving credit facility places certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including certain financial requirements and restrictions on dividend payments  with which we were in compliance as of march  key financial covenants include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x  a maximum total leverage ratio  net of cash  of x for the quarter ending march  and x thereafter  and maximum annual capital expenditures of  excluding capital expenditures for a global erp system 
our actual fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio  as calculated per the terms of our revolving credit facility  were x and x  respectively  at march  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company refinanced its notes with newly issued notes notes in the amount of  expiring february  the proceeds of the notes were used to repurchase or redeem all of the outstanding notes amounting to  and to fund working capital and other corporate activities 
the offering price of the notes was after adjustment for the original issue discount 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restrictive payments 
until february   the company may redeem up to of the outstanding notes at a redemption price of with the proceeds of equity offerings  subject to certain restrictions 
on or after february   the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at a redemption price of  reducing to on february  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future us subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
our capital lease obligations related to property and equipment leases amounted to  at march  capital lease obligations are included in senior debt in the consolidated balance sheets 
unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit are available to meet short term working capital needs for certain of our subsidiaries operating outside of the us the lines of credit are available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction 
as of march   significant unsecured credit lines totalled approximately  of which  was drawn 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of march   by period of estimated payments due total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal more than five years long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c interest obligations d letter of credit obligations bank guarantees uncertain tax positions projected pension and other postretirement obligation benefit payouts other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap e total a as described in note to consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to consolidated financial statements 
c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million 
d estimated for our senior subordinated notes due e as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no additional off balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to support new product development  improve productivity and customer responsiveness  reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of  to inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in non us economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia pacific 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  us employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included an subordinated note in the principal amount of  payable over years 
due to the uncertainty of its collection  the note was recorded at its estimated net realizable value of at the time of the divestiture 
principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly   and  of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal  and respectively  net of tax 
all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables 
the credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other factors 
accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted 
at march  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in note to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of   and  as of march    and  respectively  are primarily based on long term aa rated corporate bond rates 
the decrease in the discount rate for fiscal resulted in a  increase in the projected benefit obligation 
the decrease in the discount rates for fiscal resulted in an  increase in the projected benefit obligation as of march  the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of for each of the years ended march   and is based on the targeted plan asset allocation approximately equities and fixed income and their long term historical returns 
investment gains of  in fiscal and  in fiscal with the fiscal decrease a result of less volatility in us capital markets in fiscal our under funded status for all pension plans as of march  and was  and  or and of the projected benefit obligation  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively 
the under funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate  which is up from the fiscal amount of  the increase is primarily related to an amendment and curtailment charge in fiscal as described in note pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year is expected to increase by approximately  compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march    and is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns 
the healthcare costs inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal   and  respectively  are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
these actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors  including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims  trends or changes in claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations 
as a result  actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging 
impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment amounts in millions balance as of march  property  plant and equipment  net acquired intangibles with estimable useful lives other assets impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques 
goodwill impairment testing 
our goodwill balance   as of march  is subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  as of the end of february  and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment 
these events or circumstances could include a significant long term adverse change in the business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units for example  similar products and or services  similar long term financial results  product processes  classes of customers  etc we have four reporting units  only two of which have goodwill 
our duff norton reporting unit and rest of products reporting unit have goodwill totaling  and  respectively  at march  as a result of our annual impairment test as of february   the fair market value of our reporting units exceeded net book values and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded 
fair market value of the duff norton and rest of the products reporting units exceeded net book value by approximately and  respectively 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors 
the key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections was approximately 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years for the duff norton reporting unit and after five years for the rest of products reporting unit 
these rates reflect our estimate of long term growth into perpetuity and approximate the long term gross domestic product growth expected on a global basis 
operating profit margins were projected to return to historical norms during fiscal and fiscal in the individual reporting units 
the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix  their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization 
we also consider any additional risk of each individual reporting unit achieving its forecasts  and adjust the weighted average cost of capital applied when determining each reporting unit s estimated fair value 
future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests 
for example  a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than basis points would decrease fair market value by  and  for the duff norton reporting unit and rest of the products reporting unit  respectively  or an increase in the weighted average cost of capital by basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by  and  for the duff norton reporting unit and rest of the products reporting units  respectively 
even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values as of february   necessitating no step calculations 
we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units with goodwill are at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test  however if our actual operating results fall significantly below our projections  if the projected long term revenue growth rates  profit margins  or terminal rates decline as a result of deteriorating market conditions  and or the estimated weighted average cost of capital increases significantly  future testing may indicate impairment of one or more of the company s reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill may likely be impaired 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
we also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
during the third quarter ended december   the company recorded a non cash charge of  included within its provision for income taxes 
this charge relates to the company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the us was necessary 
the deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities related to employee benefit plans and insurance reserves and us net operating loss carryforwards 
the us net operating loss carryforwards have been generated primarily as a result of restructuring costs in fiscal years and accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment 
during the third quarter ended december   the company determined that it would be in a three year cumulative pretax loss position in the us at march  primarily due to restructuring related charges incurred in the us to date in fiscal  despite our expectations of future profitability 
if a cumulative loss threshold is met  the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary 
we recorded additional adjustments to the valuation allowance totaling  within our provision for income taxes during fiscal as a result of changes in the amounts of net deferred tax assets during the period and changes in judgment related to the expected realization of deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the company continues to believe that the strategic reorganization of its north american hoist and rigging operations that commenced in fiscal and which the company substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal will result in an estimated  in annual cost savings and such savings are ramping up during fiscal and into fiscal the recording of this non cash charge does not impact the company s ability to realize the economic benefit of its deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards on future tax returns 
in future periods  the allowance could be reduced or reversed based on sufficient objectively verifiable evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
the internal revenue code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
if we were to experience an ownership change  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed nol carryforward period 
the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five year period after the change 
effects of new accounting pronouncements on april   the company adopted the provisions of accounting standards update no 
improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu amends asc topic to require additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
specifically asu requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers  the reasons for any transfers in or out of level and information in the reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards update no 
revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition asu  which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
a vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

 when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts topic intangibles goodwill and other asu 
asu amends the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the company will adopt asu in fiscal and any impairment to be recorded upon adoption  if any  will be recognized as an adjustment to the company s beginning retained earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of asu on its condensed consolidated financial statements
