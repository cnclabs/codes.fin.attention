item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and securities  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings 
other significant sources of pre tax income are service charges on deposit accounts and other loan fees 
we also recognize income or losses from the sale of investments in years that we have such sales 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and value of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations  and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
the allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off  and allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans 
expenses 
the noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy and equipment expenses  advertising and public relations expenses  regulatory fees and deposit insurance premiums and various other miscellaneous expenses 
salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes and expenses for health insurance and other employee benefits  and stock based compensation 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to years 
advertising and public relations expenses include expenses for print  radio and television advertisements  promotions  third party marketing services and premium items 
regulatory fees and deposit insurance premiums are primarily payments we make to the fdic for insurance of our deposit accounts 
other expenses include expenses for supplies  telephone and postage  data processing  expenses related to other real estate owned by the bank  director and committee fees  professional fees  insurance and surety bond premiums and other fees and expenses 
noninterest expenses have also increased as a result of our strategy to expand our branch network 
these additional expenses consist of salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses 
over time  we anticipate that we will generate sufficient income to offset the expenses related to our new facilities and new employees  but we cannot assure you that our branch expansion will increase our earnings or that it will increase our earnings within a reasonable period of time 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date 
the 
table of contents allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  and value of collateral 
inherent loss factors are then applied to the remaining loan portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance on a quarterly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the occ  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
such agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
for additional discussion  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed in accounting standards codification asc under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period  which would negatively affect earnings 
the company adopted the provisions of asc to account for uncertainty in income taxes effective july  implementation resulted in no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption 
the company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of june  and the company recognized no interest and penalties on the underpayment of income taxes during fiscal years june  and  and had no accrued interest and penalties on the balance sheet as of june  and the company has no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase with the next twelve months 
the company is no longer subject to us federal  state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before fair value measurements 
asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities  whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for which it is practicable to estimate the value 
for financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available  fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation methods 
the following methods and assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments cash and cash equivalents 
the carrying values presented in the consolidated statements of position approximate fair value 
investments and mortgage backed securities 
for investment securities debt instruments and mortgage backed securities  fair values are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair value is estimated using quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
loans receivable 
the fair value of the loan portfolio is estimated by evaluating homogeneous categories of loans with similar financial characteristics 
loans are segregated by types  such as residential mortgage  nonresidential real estate  and consumer 
each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest  terms  and by performing and non performing categories 
the fair value of performing loans  except 
table of contents residential mortgage loans  is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows using estimated market discount rates which reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan 
for performing residential mortgage loans  fair value is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment estimates using discount rates based on secondary market sources 
the fair value for significant non performing loans is based on recent internal or external appraisals 
assumptions regarding credit risk  cash flow  and discount rates are judgmentally determined by using available market information 
federal home loan bank stock 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system and is required to maintain an investment based upon a pre determined formula 
the carrying values presented in the consolidated statements of position approximate fair value 
deposits 
the fair values of passbook accounts  now accounts  and money market savings and demand deposits approximate their carrying values 
the fair values of fixed maturity certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar maturities 
advance from federal home loan bank 
the fair value is calculated using rates available to the company on advances with similar terms and remaining maturities 
off balance sheet items 
carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value 
these instruments are generally variable rate or short term in nature  with minimal fees charged 
operating strategy our mission is to operate and grow a profitable  independent community oriented financial institution serving primarily retail customers and small businesses in our market areas 
the following are key elements of our business strategy continuing our community oriented focus as a community oriented financial institution  we emphasize providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service and respond with flexibility to customer needs 
we believe that our community orientation is attractive to our customers and distinguishes us from the large banks that operate in our market area 
our ability to succeed in our communities is enhanced by the stability of our senior management 
senior management has an average tenure with united community bank of over years 
our community focus is further supported by the community service activities of our employees and the charitable activities of the united community bank charitable foundation 
established in  the foundation provides funds to eligible nonprofit organizations with the goal of enhancing the quality of life in the communities served by united community bank 
we intend to continue to leverage these strengths in our markets for the purpose of originating new deposits and loans  particularly through our new ripley county branch offices  while continuing to focus on profitability 
implementing a controlled growth strategy to prudently increase profitability and enhance stockholder value our primary lending activity is the origination of one to four family mortgage loans secured by homes in our local market area  particularly in dearborn  ripley  franklin  ohio and switzerland counties  indiana 
between and  we expanded and diversified our lending activities by originating multi family and nonresidential real estate secured by properties in the metropolitan cincinnati market area and  to a lesser extent  in northern kentucky and the indiana counties outside of our local market area 
these multi family and nonresidential real estate loans comprise the substantial majority of our nonperforming assets 
from june  until june   our multi family real estate loans grew to million  or of our total loans outstanding from million  or of the total loan portfolio 
in the cincinnati and northern kentucky markets  our multi family loans grew from million to million  and increased as a percentage of total nonperforming loans from at june  to at june  
table of contents during the same period  our non residential real estate loans grew to million  representing  of total loans outstanding from million  or  of total loans outstanding 
in the cincinnati and northern kentucky markets  our non residential real estate loans increased to million from million  and increased as a percentage of total nonperforming loans from at june  to at june  as a result of the issues arising in our multi family and nonresidential real estate loan portfolios  in june   we implemented a strategy to control the growth of our nonresidential real estate and multi family real estate loan portfolios  particularly outside of dearborn  ripley  franklin  ohio and switzerland counties  indiana 
as part of this strategy  we also amended our loan policy to reduce our concentration limits for nonresidential real estate  multi family real estate  construction and land loans to   and  respectively  of the sum of core capital plus our allowance for loan losses 
as of june   these loans represented   and  respectively  of the sum of core capital plus our allowance for loan losses 
we intend to continue this controlled growth strategy for the foreseeable future until the local economy materially improves and the level of our nonperforming loans in these loan portfolios materially declines 
as a result  we will likely experience growth in our one to four family residential mortgage loan portfolio and in our investment securities portfolio 
accordingly  we expect that our weighted average yield on interest earning assets will decrease in future periods because one to four family mortgage loans and investment securities generally yield less than nonresidential and multi family real estate loans 
we believe our existing infrastructure and our recent expansion into ripley county  will enable us to originate new loans  subject to the foregoing strategy  both to replace existing loans as they are repaid and prudently grow our loan portfolio 
improving our asset quality we recognize that high asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
we have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio  while maintaining a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk  using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative 
we also believe that we have implemented and diligent monitoring and collection efforts 
historically  we had not incurred significant losses in our lending operations 
beginning in the year ended june   we began to experience the adverse effects of the significant national decline in real estate values and some of our borrowers ability to pay loans 
our nonperforming assets increased from million  or of total assets at june  to million  or of total assets as of june   to million  or of total assets at june  the consequences of this decline were generally evident in all portfolio types  but were more pronounced in the multi family and nonresidential real estate loans 
our initial approach to resolving nonperforming loans focused on foreclosure and liquidations in the year ended june  and the greater part of the year ended june  this manner of troubled asset resolution proved costly as a result of legal and other operating costs in the process 
as a result  beginning in the latter part of the year ended june   we placed more attention and resources on loan workouts and initiated a troubled debt restructuring process initiative with respect to nonperforming loans that provided for either restructuring the loan to the existing borrower in recognition of the lower available cash flows from the collateral properties or identification of stronger borrowers to purchase the property and refinance the loan 
under troubled debt restructurings  borrowers are granted limited rate concessions generally ranging from to basis below the then current market rate  for periods of up to three years 
if the loan performs in accordance with its restructured terms  then  at the end of the concession period  the loan is refinanced to the then current market interest rate 
under either resolution alternative  we believe we have provided the necessary valuation allowances or charge offs to reflect the loans carrying amounts at fair value at the time of restructuring 
management works closely with the internal asset review committee of the board of directors to resolve nonperforming assets in a manner most advantageous to the company 
loan workouts and modifications are handled by the president and chief executive officer  the executive vice president and chief operating officer  and the senior vice president  lending  and are subject to approval by the board of directors 
delinquent or otherwise nonperforming mortgage loan and home equity loan customers are asked to provide updated financial information and the reasons for their inability to pay or comply with the contractual terms of the loans 
management ascertains the value of the underlying collateral  depending on the type of property  through an independent appraisal or an in house cash flow analysis of the property 
if the company determines that the ultimate repayment of the loan will be derived from the sale of the property it is determined to be collateral dependent 
if the repayment will come from cash flows of the property the company will determine the 
table of contents value of the loan using the present value of expected cash flows 
once the value of collateral is established  management will treat as impaired the amount of any shortfall between the collateral value and the outstanding principal loan balance 
management will then develop and pursue a workout plan with the borrower 
once a workout plan is established and implemented  management monitors monthly performance of the loan at least until it is removed from nonaccrual status 
on an annual basis  management will conduct property inspections and review financial information of the borrowers and any guarantors 
in situations where a collateral value shortfall ie  the value of the underlying collateral of the loan is less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan is discovered on a previously existing loan  typically through an updated appraisal or collateral inspection  management will seek to obtain additional collateral and or a personal guaranty at that time 
if no additional collateral or personal guaranty is available  management will work with the borrower on a suitable workout arrangement that may include a troubled debt restructuring  or foreclose on the collateral property 
in determining the best suited workout arrangement  management reviews the financial condition of the borrower  the cash flow of the collateral property and the value of the loan s collateral 
if we obtain a personal guaranty or a co borrower  we assess the strength and value of the guaranty or co borrower at the time the loan is closed and the guaranty granted and re evaluate it at least annually 
the strength of each guaranty is determined by evaluating the guarantor s net worth  liquid net worth  debt to income ratio and credit score 
in certain circumstances  we may deem it appropriate not to enforce a guaranty  such as when it determines enforcing a guaranty could be detrimental to a larger banking relationship 
at june   approximately million  or  of our nonperforming loans were troubled debt restructurings 
during the third quarter of the year ended june   we began restructuring loans into a note a note b format 
upon performing a global analysis of the total lending relationship with the involved borrower  the terms of note a are calculated using current financial information to determine the amount of the payment at which the borrower would have a debt service coverage ratio of x or better  which is more stringent than our current underwriting standards  which typically require a debt service coverage ratio of x 
that payment is calculated based upon a year amortization period  then fixed for two years  with the loan maturing at the end of the two year period 
the amount for note b is the difference between the amount of note a and the original payoff amount to be refinanced  plus all other expenses necessary to restructure the loans 
note b is given the same interest rate and balloon term as note a  but no principal or interest payments are due until maturity 
while no amount of the original indebtedness of the borrower is forgiven through this process  the full amount of note b is charged off at the time of issuance of note b 
note a is treated as any other tdr and  generally  may return to accrual status after a history of performance in accordance with the restructured terms of at least six consecutive months is established 
the intended positive effect of employing the note a note b strategy is twofold 
first  this restructuring and subsequent charge offs to an as is fair value determination enables the company to expeditiously liquidate delinquent loan balances if the restructured loans experience further delinquency 
second  the company believes that  because of its implementation of this strategy and because the loans which needed to be restructured in this manner represented a distinct identifiable pool of loans  the to day delinquent migration of nonresidential and multi family loans has slowed significantly 
specifically  as of june   these loan delinquencies declined to  from million at december  while we note the higher charge offs encountered in one to four family and consumer loans in fiscal  we do not view any further significant adverse trends continuing with respect to these loan types that would require a material adjustment to our allowance for loan losses 
for additional information regarding our troubled debt restructurings  see risk management analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we have implemented more stringent underwriting standards for our residential lending programs 
we have enhanced our document requirements and document review process 
residential real estate mortgage applicants are required to have a higher credit score than previously required 
we have reduced the maximum loan to value ratio for consumer loans from to 
commercial and nonresidential real estate loan customers are required to provide us with rent rolls  and financial statements for evaluation on a more frequent basis  and members of our loan department are in more regular contact with these customers 
annually  every loan with an outstanding balance of at least million is reviewed by an independent third party loan reviewer 
we have hired a credit analyst to perform an annual review of all commercial loans having an outstanding balance of at least million 
as discussed above  we have also implemented a strategy to control the growth of our nonresidential real estate and 
table of contents multi family real estate loan portfolios 
for additional information on this strategy  see implementing a controlled growth strategy to prudently increase profitability and enhance stockholder value 
improving our funding mix by attracting lower cost core deposits core deposits include all deposit account types except certificates of deposit and municipal deposits 
core deposits represent our best opportunity to develop customer relationships that enable us to cross sell our full complement of products and services 
core deposits are our least costly source of funds which improves our interest rate spread and also contributes non interest income from account related services  and are generally less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate 
at june   core deposits represented of our total deposits compared to at june  municipal deposits represent tax and other revenues from the local gaming industry 
since may   we have been required to pledge collateral to the indiana board of depositories equal to of the municipal deposits maintained at united community bank 
the percentage that we are required to pledge as collateral will periodically vary based on a number of financial factors 
in recent years  we have steadily decreased our reliance on municipal deposits as a percentage of total deposits 
at june   municipal deposits represented of total deposits  compared to of total deposits at june  while we expect municipal deposits to continue to remain an important source of funding  we expect to continue to improve our funding mix by marketing lower cost core deposits 
we aggressively market core deposits through concentrated advertising and public relations 
in recent years  we have significantly expanded and improved the products and services we offer our retail and business deposit customers who maintain core deposit accounts and have improved our infrastructure for critical electronic banking services  including online banking  bill pay  estatements  merchant capture  and business online cash management tools that include ach origination  direct deposit  payroll  federal tax payment  wire transfer capabilities 
the deposit infrastructure we have established can accommodate significant increases in retail and business deposit accounts without additional capital expenditure 
continuing to increase noninterest income our earnings rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
in order to decrease our reliance on interest rate spread income  we have pursued initiatives to increase noninterest income 
our primary recurring source of non interest income has been service charges on deposit products and other services 
however  recent regulatory changes have restricted our ability to charge for other services and will increase the difficulty of expanding our service fee income 
we have also implemented  and realize fee income from  an overdraft protection program and from customer use of debit cards 
we also have a significant secondary mortgage operation  including loan servicing  and we continue to invest in personnel and systems to increase our ability to sell one to four family mortgages in the secondary market to increase fee income and reduce interest rate risk through the sale of conforming long term fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
to date  all loans are sold without recourse but with servicing retained 
the volume of loans sold totaled million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
for the years ended june  and  we earned  and  respectively  on the sale of loans 
we intend to continue to originate loans for sale in the secondary market to grow our servicing portfolio and generate additional non interest income 
we continue to review programs to further enhance our service fee structure within the new regulatory environment 
we have also enhanced our ability to increase our non interest income from the sale of non deposit investment and insurance products through lincoln financial advisors  a third party registered broker dealer  by adding two new investment advisors to serve our branch offices 
upgrading our existing branches  particularly the branch offices we acquired in june  in an effort to retain customers and attract new customers  we have  in recent years  significantly remodeled four of our offices to improve the d cor and traffic flow of the public spaces 
of these four  our stateline road branch office was almost doubled in size and significant office space was added to our aurora branch office  in each case to accommodate the growth we have experienced at those offices 
we have also remodeled those offices to improve the presentation of the products and services we are offering to our customers 
we intend to continue to upgrade our branch facilities  particularly the branch offices we recently acquired in ripley county  indiana 
total remodeling expenses for fiscal approximated  all of which has been capitalized 

table of contents expanding our geographic footprint we consider our primary deposit and lending market area to be dearborn  ripley  franklin  ohio and switzerland counties  indiana 
in recent years  we have expanded our lending efforts in the greater cincinnati metropolitan area and northern kentucky 
since  we have grown our community banking franchise organically through the addition of de novo branches in st 
leon and aurora  indiana  and through the strategic acquisition of three branch offices in ripley county  indiana 
as a result  we have increased our branch network from four to nine offices 
we plan to continue to seek opportunities to grow our business through a combination of de novo branching and complementary acquisitions in our existing market and contiguous markets 
we will consider acquisition opportunities that expand our geographic reach in banking  insurance or other complementary financial service businesses  although we do not currently have any agreements or understandings regarding any specific acquisition 
balance sheet analysis total assets were million at june   compared to million at june  total liabilities were million at june   compared to million at june  total stockholders equity was million at june   compared to million at june  the decrease in assets was primarily due to a million decrease in loans  reflecting the combined effect of the refinancing of million of residential mortgage loans into lower fixed rate loans which were sold to freddie mac  and the prepayment of several large commercial loans aggregating million in the current fiscal year 
the decrease in liabilities was primarily due to a million decrease in municipal deposits and a million decrease in other deposits resulting from the bank s decision to reduce its reliance on municipal deposits and other higher cost deposits 
at june   the bank s regulatory capital exceeded the levels required to be categorized as well capitalized under applicable regulatory capital guidelines 
loans 
our primary lending activity is the origination of loans secured by real estate 
we originate one to four family residential loans  multi family and nonresidential real estate loans and construction loans 
to a lesser extent  we originate commercial and consumer loans 
from time to time  as part of our loss mitigation process  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when we determine that greater economic value will ultimately be recovered under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
we may consider the borrower s payment status and history  the borrower s ability to pay upon a rate reset on an adjustable rate mortgage  size of the payment increase upon a rate reset  period of time remaining prior to the rate reset  and other relevant factors in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty 
we do not offer  and have not previously offered  subprime  alt a  low doc  no doc loans or loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest only loans 
the largest segment of our loan portfolio is one to four family residential loans 
at june   these loans totaled million  or of total gross loans  compared to million  or of total gross loans  at june  during the past two years  decreases in one to four family mortgages due to customers refinancing into fixed rate loans that are being sold to freddie mac have generally been offset by the loans we acquired with the three integra branch offices in june and by increased loan production in the two de novo branches we have opened since multi family and nonresidential real estate and land loans totaled million and represented of total loans at june   compared to million  or of total loans  at june  while charge offs have recently reduced these portfolios  they remain a substantial segment of our loan portfolio 
however  we have recently implemented a controlled growth strategy that is expected to reduce these portfolios as a percentage of total loans

table of contents mortgage backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of one to four family or multi family real estate mortgages 
the mortgage originators use intermediaries generally us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises to pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities  with investors receiving the principal and interest payments on the mortgages 
such us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors 
mortgage backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts  and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a range and have varying maturities 
the underlying pools of mortgages  ie  fixed rate or adjustable rate  as well as prepayment risk  are passed on to the certificate holder 
the life of a mortgage backed pass through security approximates the life of the underlying mortgages 
our mortgage backed securities consist of ginnie mae securities  freddie mac securities and fannie mae securities 
ginnie mae is a government agency within the department of housing and urban development which is intended to help finance government assisted housing programs 
ginnie mae securities are backed by loans insured by the federal housing administration  or guaranteed by the veterans administration 
the timely payment of principal and interest on ginnie mae securities is guaranteed by ginnie mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
freddie mac is a private corporation chartered by the us government 
freddie mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans 
freddie mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates 
fannie mae is a private corporation chartered by the us congress with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans 
fannie mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on fannie mae securities 
freddie mac and fannie mae securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
in september  the federal housing finance agency was appointed as conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac 
the us department of the treasury agreed to provide capital as needed to ensure that fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets 
mortgage backed securities generally yield less than the loans which underlie such securities because of their payment guarantees or credit enhancements which offer nominal credit risk 
in addition  mortgage backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize our borrowings or other obligations 
mortgage backed securities generally increase the quality of united community bancorp s assets by virtue of the insurance or guarantees that back them  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of united community bancorp 
at june   approximately million of our mortgage backed and investment securities were pledged to secure various obligations of united community bancorp 
united community bancorp has not knowingly invested in subprime mortgage backed securities 
the actual maturity of a mortgage backed security is typically less than its stated maturity due to prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and increase or decrease its yield to maturity if the security was purchased at a discount or premium  respectively 
the yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the mortgage backed security 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans  which decrease and increase interest income  respectively 
the prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage backed security  when premiums or discounts are involved  and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  including the type of mortgages  the coupon rate  the age of mortgages  the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of falling mortgage interest rates  if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans  refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security 
under such circumstances  united community bancorp may be subject to reinvestment risk because to the extent that the mortgage backed securities amortize or prepay faster than anticipated  united community bancorp may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and 
table of contents prepayments at a comparable rate 
during periods of rising interest rates  prepayment rates of the underlying mortgages generally slow down when the coupon rate of such mortgages is less than the prevailing market rate 
we may be subject to extension risk when this occurs 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
the evaluation is based upon factors such as the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  the underlying collateral  if applicable  and the continuing performance of the securities 
management also evaluates other facts and circumstances that may be indicative of an other than temporary impairment condition 
this includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of the type of security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and near term prospects of the issuers 
marketable equity securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairments based on the severity and duration of the impairment and  if deemed to be other than temporary  the declines in fair value are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
for debt securities  other than temporary impairment is required to be recognized if we intend to sell the security  if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis

the increase in net interest income was the result of an increase in the average balances in interest earning assets from million in the prior year to million in the current year combined with a decrease in the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities from for the prior year to for the current year  partially offset by a decrease in the average rate earned on interest earning assets from for the prior year to for the current year and an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities from million in the prior year to million in the current year 
the decrease in rates and yields was driven by continued low market interest rates in the current year 
the increase in average balances was due to the aforementioned branch acquisition

interest expense 
interest expense decreased  for the year ended june  as compared to the same period in  resulting from decreases in the rates paid on deposits and borrowings and a million decrease in the average balance of federal home loan bank advances  offset by an increase in average interest bearing deposits of million 
rates paid on average deposits decreased basis points from to 
the rates paid on federal home loan bank advances remained unchanged 
contributing to higher average deposits were increases in now and money market deposit accounts  passbook accounts and certificates of deposit of million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to the previously discussed acquisition of three branch offices in june provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended june   compared to million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of the charge off of million in loans  of which million related to the restructuring of loans having an aggregate outstanding principal balance prior to their restructurings of million 
the restructured loans  which include our five largest nonaccrual loans  relate to six loan relationships 
each of these loan relationships represents long time borrowers of the company and each of the loans was being carefully monitored by management due to the borrowers prior disclosure to management that they were experiencing short term cash flow deficiencies 
all of the borrowers loans had been tested for impairment prior to the issuance of the company s june  audited consolidated financial statements and  as deemed necessary by management  prior to the issuance of the company s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended september  and december  in measuring impairment  management considered the results of internal and independent property appraisals  together with estimated selling expenses  and or detailed cash flow analyses 
based on such reviews  management concluded at june   september   and december   that such loans were appropriately carried at the lower of the cost of the loan or the fair value of the loan after considering the allowance for loan losses at such dates 
a detailed discussion of these loan relationships and our most significant nonaccrual loans is set forth in the section below entitled analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
during the quarter ended march   management became aware of material deterioration in the financial condition of these major loan relationships that were struggling despite having been recently restructured 
specific cash flow issues identified included borrowers missing real estate tax payments  homeowners association dues not being paid  the required monthly loan payment not being paid or being paid late  decreases in rental revenue from rental properties  and further declines in the value of the underlying collateral 
these cash flow shortfalls called into question the long term collectability of the loans 
accordingly  management began to review these loan relationships during the quarter ended march  to determine if the borrowers could continue to afford their monthly principal and interest payments beyond the expiration of their lower restructured payment period 
as a result of this review  management undertook a split note strategy  referred to as the note a b strategy  primarily to achieve debt coverage ratios for the restructured loans that supported the borrowers as is cash flow status during the quarter ended march   without forgiving any of the borrowers original indebtedness 
the as is approach is the one most commonly used by the company where the property is valued using current information about rental revenue  occupancy rates and expenses 

table of contents under the note a note b strategy  note a was underwritten based on the company s normal underwriting standards with the exception that a debt service coverage ratio of x or higher was required 
this is more stringent than the company s normal underwriting guidelines which generally require a debt service coverage of x or better 
the note a payment is based on a thirty year amortization schedule and matures at the end of two years 
the amount of note b is the difference between the amount of note a and the principal amount to be refinanced 
the interest rate and two year maturity of the note b loan are identical to the note a loan  but the note b loan requires no payments of interest or principal until maturity 
while no amount of the original indebtedness was forgiven through this process  the full amount of the borrowers note b indebtedness  totaling million  was charged off in march   reflecting management s conclusion that  based on specific events negatively impacting each of the borrowers financial condition  collection of this portion of the indebtedness was doubtful and should be charged off 
finally  the utilization of this strategy also enables management to concentrate its collection efforts on the remaining greater than day delinquent credits which had declined to million at june  noninterest income 
the following table shows the components of other income for the years ended june  and change dollars in thousands service charges gain on sale loans gain loss on sale of investments gain on sale of other real estate owned income from bank owned life insurance other total the increase in noninterest income is attributable to the increase in service charges of million  an increase in gain on sale of investments of million  and an increase in gain on sale of loans of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in other noninterest income 
the increase in service charges is due to an increased customer base primarily resulting from the previously mentioned branch acquisition in june the increase in gain on sale of investments resulted from increased profit from the sale of certain investments that were in an unrealized gain position at the time of the sale 
the increase in sale of loans to freddie mac is the result of continued favorable rates offered by freddie mac for the purchase of fixed rate loans 
the decrease in other income is attributable to the settlement of a claim in the prior year

the decrease in provision for loss on sale of other real estate owned was the result of no such provision needed for the current year 
the remaining increases and decreases are primarily attributable to the previously mentioned branch acquisition in june income taxes 
income tax expense decreased to a benefit of million for the year ended june   compared to expenses of million the year ended june  the million decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease of million in income before taxes 
the effective tax rates for and were affected by tax exempt municipal bond income and income on bank owned life insurance in addition to an unanticipated state tax refund of million received in the current year which related to prior years 
risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities  that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
we have also implemented a controlled growth strategy 
this strategy also emphasizes the origination of one to four family mortgage loans  which typically have lower default rates than other types of loans and are secured by collateral that generally tends to appreciate in value 
in june  we amended our loan policies to reduce our concentration limits for multi family and nonresidential real estate loans to and  respectively  and for construction and land loans to  of the sum of core capital plus our allowance for loan losses 
as of june   these loans 
table of contents represented   and  respectively  of the sum of core capital plus our allowance for loan losses 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to attempt to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
when the loan becomes days past due  a late charge notice is generated and sent to the borrower and phone calls are made 
if payment is not then received by the th day of delinquency  a further notification is sent to the borrower 
if no successful workout can be achieved  after a loan becomes days delinquent  we may commence foreclosure or other legal proceedings 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure 
we may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances in the form of a troubled debt restructuring 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure 
management reports to the board of directors monthly regarding the amount of loans delinquent more than days and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider foreclosed real estate  repossessed assets  nonaccrual loans  and troubled debt restructurings that are delinquent or have not been performing to terms for a reasonable amount of time to be nonperforming assets 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest is in doubt  or at the latest when a loan becomes days delinquent 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
all commercial loans that are placed on nonaccrual status are evaluated for impairment at the time the loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as a nonperforming asset until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is initially recorded at the lower of its cost  or market  less estimate selling expenses 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
historically  we had not incurred significant losses in our lending operations 
beginning in the year ended june   we began to experience the adverse effects of a significant national decline in real estate values 
the consequences of this decline were generally evident in all portfolio types  but were more pronounced in multi family and nonresidential real estate loans  particularly in markets outside of dearborn and ripley counties 
our approach to resolving nonperforming loans focused on foreclosure and liquidations in the year ended june  and the greater part of the year ended june  this manner of troubled asset resolution proved costly as a result of legal and other operating costs in the process 
as a result  beginning in the latter part of the year ended june   management initiated a restructuring process with respect to nonperforming loans that provided for either restructuring the loan to the borrower in recognition of the lower available cash flows from the collateral properties or identification of stronger borrowers to refinance the loan 
in evaluating whether to restructure a loan  we consider the borrower s payment status and history  the borrower s ability to pay upon a rate reset on an adjustable rate mortgage  size of the payment increase upon a rate reset  period of time remaining before the rate reset  and other relevant factors in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty 
through these troubled debt restructurings  management believes they have provided the necessary valuation allowances or charge offs to reflect the loans carrying amounts at fair value 
the general concept underlying fair value would indicate that the collateral properties could be sold to other third parties without material loss if the restructuring efforts fail 
loan workouts and modifications are handled by the president and chief executive officer  the executive vice president and chief operating officer  and the senior vice president  lending  and are subject to approval by the board of directors 
delinquent or otherwise nonperforming mortgage loan and home equity loan customers are required to provide updated financial information and the reasons for their inability to pay or comply with the 
table of contents contractual terms of their loans 
management ascertains the value of the underlying collateral  depending on whether the loan is collateral dependent or cash flow dependent 
if a loan is determined to be collateral dependent  the value of the underlying collateral is determined through an independent appraisal 
if the loan is determined to be cash flow dependent  the value of the underlying collateral is determined through an in house cash flow analysis of the property 
once the value of collateral is established  management will take a specific reserve for the charge off equal to the amount of any shortfall from the collateral value to the outstanding principal loan balance 
management will then develop and pursue a workout plan 
once a workout plan is established and implemented  management will  at a minimum  monitor the monthly performance of the loan until it is removed from nonaccrual status 
on an annual basis  management will conduct property inspections and review financial information of the borrowers and any guarantors 
in situations where a collateral shortfall ie the value of the underlying collateral of the loan is less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan is discovered on a previously existing loan  typically through an updated independent appraisal or collateral inspection  management will seek to obtain additional collateral and or a personal guaranty at that time 
if no additional collateral is available  management will work with the borrower on a suitable workout arrangement that may include a troubled debt restructuring  or management may determine to foreclose on the property 
to determine the best outcome for the bank  management reviews the financial condition of the borrower  the cash flow of the property and the value of the loan s collateral 
if the bank obtains a guaranty  the strength and value of the guaranty is measured by the bank at the time the loan is closed and is re evaluated at least annually 
the strength of each guaranty is determined by evaluating the guarantor s net worth  liquid net worth  debt to income ratio and credit score 
in certain circumstances  the bank may deem it appropriate not to enforce a guaranty  such as when it determines enforcing a guaranty could be detrimental to a larger banking relationship 
since december   the bank has successfully collected  from five personal guarantors and has forbearance agreements to collect an additional million 
of the forbearance agreements two  totaling million  are in the form of liens on excess collateral on existing loans 
the remaining agreements are for smaller individual balances  and the bank is receiving regular payments on these amounts 
the entire balance of each forbearance is considered impaired and payments are treated as recoveries when received 
after the restructuring is completed  if the borrower continues to experience payment difficulties  or there is an additional decline in the collateral value identified in the annual property inspection or updated appraisal  management may impair the loan further  restructure the loan again  or foreclose on the collateral property 
at this point  management considers all of the same factors it did when the initial restructuring occurred  and attempts to resolve the situation so as to achieve the best outcome for the bank 
troubled debt restructurings are considered to be nonperforming  except for those that have established a sufficient performance history generally at a minimum of six consecutive months of performance under the restructured terms under the terms for the restructured loan 
at june   loans were considered to be troubled debt restructurings with aggregate balances of million of which loans with aggregate balances of million were included in nonperforming assets 
at june   loans were considered to be troubled debt restructurings with aggregate balances of million of which loans with aggregate balances of million were included in nonperforming assets

no interest related to nonaccrual loans was included in interest income for the years ended june  and during the year ended june   nonperforming loans increased from million to million 
the increase in nonperforming loans was primarily the result of the increase in troubled debt restructurings on nonaccrual status from million at june  to million at june  the company continued to experience performance issues in multifamily and nonresidential real estate loan portfolio secured by properties primarily outside of dearborn and ripley counties  as reflected in the level of classified assets at june  and as a result  in the third quarter of the year ended june   management reviewed all classified assets and ultimately restructured million of loans during the period 
all of these restructured assets had been included in nonperforming loans prior to the restructuring  and will remain in nonperforming loans until they establish a history of performance in accordance with their restructured terms for at least six consecutive months 
a discussion of the most significant nonaccrual loans  which includes the five largest nonaccrual loans at june   and the five largest charge offs recognized during the year ended june  follows 
these loans comprise million  or  of the million in total nonaccrual loans at june  management monitors the performance of these loans and reviews all options available to keep the loans current  including further restructuring of the loans 
if restructuring efforts ultimately are not successful  management will initiate foreclosure proceedings

this analysis supported the million carrying value of the loan 
according to our loan modification policy  performing an evaluation for the other two loans was not required at the time of the restructuring as these loans were performing in accordance with their original terms and therefore perceived to have less risk than the nonperforming loan 
however  in accordance with the loan modification policy  a property inspection report was completed for the other two loans

in march  one of these loans was again restructured through a troubled debt restructuring as a result of the borrower experiencing cash flow problems during the quarter ended march  the cash flow problems experienced were the combined effect of decreased rental income and the failure to pay real estate property taxes

this relationship was performing in accordance with its restructured terms at june  loan relationship f 
two loans with an aggregate carrying value of  at june  these loans  originally one loan  are secured by single family and multifamily residential real estate 
these loans are included in the above table as nonaccrual restructured loans  multi family real estate at june   and for the two loans in this relationship at june   one loan  totaling  was included in nonaccrual restructured loans  multi family real estate and one loan  totaling  was included in nonaccrual loans  multi family real estate 
in the credit risk profile by internally assigned grade table on pages and  these loans were classified as multi family real estate  substandard at june  and june   respectively 
the original loan was originally restructured in a note a note b format in june  based on an ltv derived from an april  appraisal 
at december   the loans were subject to a specific reserve of  this reserve is for the entire amount of original note b 
the amount of reserve for loss on this loan remained unchanged up to the time of the second restructuring  as noted below  because management determined the value of the underlying collateral was not impaired based upon regular property 
table of contents inspections as evidenced by the most recent appraisal in february   when management noted a  decrease in the value of the collateral 
at december   the loan was days delinquent 
the delinquency was a result of personal problems between the borrowers affecting their ability to manage the multi family residential real estate 
in the latter part of and into  one of the borrowers effectively took control of the multi family residential real estate and has brought the business current with respect to property taxes  refunds to former tenants  and made required monthly loan payments in january and february  other than the january and february loan payments  the borrowers have been unable to bring the loan current under their current cash flow 
based upon those developments  management completed a detailed analysis of the total lending relationship with the borrowers 
as a result of this analysis  these loans were again restructured  utilizing the note a note b format in march  the terms of the note a were calculated using current financial information to determine the amount of the payment at which the borrowers would have a debt service coverage ratio of approximately x  which is more stringent than our current underwriting standards 
a restructuring fee of  was charged and included in note b at march  one of the borrowers is a corporate entity  with two principals  who are also individually signed on the loan

management has no knowledge of any additional loans that will require restructuring 

table of contents the following table provides information with respect to all of our loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings 
troubled debt restructurings are considered to be impaired  except for those that have established a sufficient performance history under the terms for the restructured loan

many of these loans also have balloon payments due at the end of their lowered rate period  requiring the borrower to refinance at market rates at that time 
at june   there were loans with required payments of principal and interest  and nine loans with required interest only payments 
at june   there were seven loans with required principal and interest payments  eight loans with required interest only payments  and two loans with no payments due until at june   there were three loans with required interest only payments  and two loans with no payments due until although the economic trends during the year ended june  have been generally stable in our primary market area  ie  dearborn and ripley counties in indiana  the overall increases in troubled debt restructurings from june  to june

federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the occ has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as special mention  we account for those classifications when establishing a general allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as substandard  doubtful or loss  we establish a specific allowance for the asset at that time 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated

the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
the recommendations for increases or decreases to the allowance are presented by management to the board of directors 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance on identified impaired loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowance required for identified impaired loans 
we establish an allowance on certain identified impaired loans based on such factors as the strength of the customer s personal or business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  the estimated cost to sell the collateral  and the borrower s effort to cure the delinquency 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are not delinquent to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning historical loss percentages to each category 
the percentages are adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  
table of contents affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas and the national economy  staff lending experience  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  specific reserve and classified asset trends  delinquency trends and risk rating trends 
these loss factors are subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
as a result of our systematic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the loss factors we presently use to determine the reserve level are based on various risk factors such as trends in underperforming loans  trends and concentrations in loans and loan volume  economic trends in our market area  particularly the impact of the gaming and tourism industry on the economy of our market area  the effect of which has become significant in recent periods 
we also identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans  classified loans and other loans that management may have concerns about collectability 
on a monthly basis  management reviews all substandard commercial loans and all loans that are more than days delinquent 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews all classified assets and on an annual basis  management reviews all major lending relationships relationships greater than million 
the review of major loan relationships includes completing an updated property inspection report  and obtaining current tax returns and financial information about the borrower and the property 
when impaired loans are identified  management will reduce the loan to fair value and charge off the difference between the outstanding balance and fair value to the allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  management will review the allowance for loan losses based upon the criteria discussed above and make adjustments to the allowance accordingly 
any commercial loan that is included in delinquent loans  classified loans  or other loans about which management may have concerns is individually reviewed for impairment on a monthly basis 
for individually reviewed loans  the borrowers inability to make payments under the terms of these loans  or the existence of a shortfall in the collateral value relating to these loans  could result in our allocating a portion of the allowance to the loans that were impaired 
at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans and amounted to million at such date compared to million at june  at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
from june  to june  the loan portfolio experienced increases of million in nonperforming loans  million in nonperforming assets  million in classified assets  and million in troubled debt restructurings 
the increases in troubled assets were primarily the result of the addition of troubled debt restructurings totaling million during the year ended june  as a result of the deteriorating credit quality  the loan loss provision increased million for the year ended june  from june  to june   the loan portfolio experienced further increases of million in nonperforming loans  million in nonperforming assets  million in classified assets  and million in troubled debt restructurings 
this resulted in the determination to establish a loan loss provision of million for the year ended june  the increases in troubled assets were primarily the result of utilization of the note a note b strategy and related charge offs of million recorded during the third quarter of the year ended june  for more information on the note a note b strategy and the related charge offs  see results of operations for the years ended june  and provision for loan loss 
when a loan first becomes a troubled debt restructuring  it is included in nonaccrual loans until a history of at least six consecutive monthly payments can be established 
troubled debt restructurings are also classified as substandard assets for the life of the restructured terms 
because nonaccrual loans are included in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets and are also considered classified assets  the increase in troubled debt restructurings was the primary reason for the increase in nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets  and classified assets 
additionally  from june  to june  the loan portfolio experienced an aggregate increase of million in loans days delinquent 
from june  to june  the loan portfolio experienced an aggregate decrease of million in loans days delinquent 
this change is attributable to the utilization of the note a note b strategy and the related charge offs of million upon performing a detailed review of the company s significant troubled lending relationships during the third quarter of the year ended june  the restructuring of these loans has had a significantly positive impact on our past due loans receivable as the majority of our past due amounts centered around a specific segment of our loan portfolio 

table of contents the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  the amount of the provision in the year ended june  was the result of the increase in troubled debt restructurings 
as previously discussed  the increase in troubled debt restructurings adversely impacted nonaccrual loans  nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets  and classified assets 
the increased provision was necessary to replenish the allowance for loan loss following the recognition of charge offs related to several loans restructured 
as noted earlier  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans coverage ratio decreased from to from june  to this decrease was a result of the significant change in composition of nonperforming loans during this time 
at june  and  troubled debt restructurings were and of nonperforming loans  respectively 
troubled debt restructurings have generally been charged off or written down to their fair value at the time of the restructuring 
the fair value at the time of restructuring is determined by a recent independent appraisal or cash flow analysis of the underlying collateral 
as a result of the recent fair value determinations of a majority of the loans that are included in nonperforming loans  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased from june  to june  
table of contents the following table illustrates the changes to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended june  allowance for credit losses and recorded investment in loans receivable for the year ended june  one to four family mortgage owner occupied consumer one to four family mortgage nonowner occupied multi family mortgage nonowner occupied non residential real estate construction land commercial and agricultural total allowance for credit losses beginning balance charge offs recoveries provision ending balance balance  individually evaluated balance  collectively evaluated financing receivables ending balance ending balance individually evaluated for impairment ending balance collectively evaluated for impairment ending balance loans acquired at fair value 
table of contents the most significant increases in classified assets from june  to june  occurred in one to four family  multi family  and non residential real estate loans resulting in corresponding increases to provisions for loan losses relating to these portfolios 
overall increases in the allowance allocated to these portfolios was warranted as other risk factors stemming from increases in classified assets and delinquencies have increased as well

table of contents adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that the occ  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
analysis of loan loss experience 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
year ended june  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs one to four family residential real estate land nonresidential real estate multi family real estate consumer and other loans total charge offs recoveries one to four family residential real estate nonresidential real estate and land multi family real estate consumer and other loans total recoveries net charge offs loss on restructuring of loan allowance at end of period allowance to nonperforming loans allowance to total loans outstanding at the end of the period net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the period the charge offs in the year ended june  were primarily the result of the previously mentioned restructuring of loans having an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
charge offs in the year ended june  were primarily the result of one loan secured by a mobile home park 
the loan was charged off in september  and taken into other real estate owned at that time 
the property was sold in february  and we restructured the loan as a troubled debt restructuring 
the loan is included in nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings and was performing in accordance with its restructured terms at june  charge offs in the year ended june  were the result of four loans in two lending relationships 
three of the loans  included in one relationship for a landscape nursery  were charged off in august   the inventory and assets from the business were liquidated  and the real estate was taken into other real estate owned 
the real property was sold in june  and we financed the sale as a troubled debt restructuring 
due to its performance history  it is classified as an accruing troubled debt restructuring and was performing according to its restructured terms at june  the fourth loan was related to loan relationship d included in analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
this loan was classified as a nonaccrual troubled debt restructuring and was performing according to its restructured terms at june  the increase in charge offs in the year ended june  is the result of the two loans that were foreclosed and taken into other real estate owned in may  one property  a golf course  was sold in december  we provided the sales financing and restructured the loan as a troubled debt restructuring due to additional collateral that was provided by the borrower at the time of restructuring 
this loan was performing according to terms and was considered an accruing troubled debt restructuring at june  the other property is land held for future residential development that is adjacent to the aforementioned golf course 
this property is included in other real estate owned at june  interest rate risk management 
we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes adjusting the maturities of borrowings  adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration  and generally selling in the secondary market newly originated conforming fixed rate  and year one to four family residential real estate loans and available for sale securities 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 

table of contents we have an asset liability committee  which includes members of management and board members  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income 
net portfolio value analysis 
we use a net portfolio value analysis prepared by the occ to review our level of interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
these analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or and basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
because of the low level of market interest rates  these analyses are not performed for decreases of more than basis points 
the following table  which is based on information that we provided to the ots prior to the july  transition date  presents the change in our net portfolio value at june  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on occ assumptions  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change 
net portfolio value dollars in thousands net portfolio value as of portfolio value of assets basis point bp change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp   bp  bp  bp  bp   bp the occ uses various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance 
table of contents that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity 
liquidity management 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demands  expected deposit flows  in particular municipal deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june  securities classified as available for sale whose market value exceeds our cost  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at june  total securities classified as available for sale were million at june  in addition  at june   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately million from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
at june  the bank s total commitment to extend credit at variable rates was million 
the amount of fixed rate commitments was approximately  at june  the fixed rate loan commitments at june  have interest rates ranging from to 
in addition  the bank had  of letters of credit outstanding at june  certificates of deposit due within one year of june  totaled million 
this represented of certificates of deposit at june  we believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before june  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
the following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than years dollars in thousands at june  long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities 
our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits

united community bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the occ  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at june   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see regulation and supervision regulation of federal savings associations capital requirements  and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  letters of credit and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently have no plans to engage in hedging activities in the future 
for the year ended june   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
