overview we are a supplier of automotive replacement parts and fasteners and service line products primarily for the automotive aftermarket 
we market approximately  different automotive replacement parts including brake parts  fasteners and service line products manufactured to our specifications 
approximately of our parts and of our net sales consists of parts and fasteners that were original equipment dealer exclusive items at the time of their introduction 
original equipment dealer exclusive parts are those which were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or salvage yards and include  among other parts  intake manifolds  exhaust manifolds  oil cooler lines  window regulators  radiator fan assemblies  power steering pulleys and harmonic balancers 
fasteners include such items as oil drain plugs and wheel lug nuts 
approximately of our products are sold under our brand names and the remainder is sold for resale under customers private labels  other brands or in bulk 
our products are sold primarily in the united states through automotive aftermarket retailers such as autozone  advance auto and o reilly  national  regional and local warehouse distributors such as carquest and napa and specialty markets and salvage yards 
through our scan tech subsidiary  we are increasing our international distribution of automotive replacement parts  with sales into europe  the middle east and asia 
we are increasing distribution of automotive replacement parts in canada through our dorman canada business unit 
we generate over of our revenues from customers in the north american automotive aftermarket 
the aftermarket has benefited from some of the factors affecting the general economy including the recent recession  tighter credit and higher unemployment 
these conditions as well as others have resulted in a recent decline in new vehicle sales and the increase in the average age of vehicles on the road 
these trends will increase the number of automotive aftermarket parts that need replacing 
another important statistic impacting our market is total miles driven 
total us miles driven were up slightly in and after being down in each of the two prior years 
we believe that the combination of these factors accounted for a portion of our and sales growth 
while the overall automotive aftermarket in which we compete has benefited from the conditions mentioned above  our customer base has been consolidating over the past several years 
as a result  our customers regularly seek more favorable pricing  product returns and extended payment terms when negotiating with us 
while we attempt to avoid or minimize such concessions  in some cases pricing concessions have been made  customer payment terms have been extended and returns of product have exceeded historical levels 
the product returns and more favorable pricing primarily affect our profit levels while terms extensions generally reduce operating cash flow and require additional capital to finance the business 
we expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
gross profit margins declined in each of the three years prior to as a result of this pricing pressure 
during and we were able to offset the negative impact of the pricing pressures and mix shift by reducing product warranty and return costs and by lowering freight and material costs 
as a result  our and gross profit margins improved despite the negative factors impacting the automotive aftermarket mentioned above 
we expect our customers to continue to exert pressure on our margins 
we have increased our focus on efficiency improvements and product cost reduction initiatives to offset the impact of further price pressures 

table of contents in addition  we are relying on new product development as a way to offset some of these customer demands and as our primary vehicle for growth 
as such  new product development is a critical success factor for us 
we have invested heavily in resources necessary for us to increase our new product development efforts and to strengthen our relationships with our customers 
these investments are primarily in the form of increased product development resources and awareness programs and customer service improvements 
this has enabled us to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow our revenues 
we may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by our customers 
generally  the second and third quarters have the highest level of customer orders  but the introduction of new products and product lines to customers may cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
we operate on a fifty two  fifty three week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
the fiscal years ended december   december   and december  are all fifty two week periods 
asset write down during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain acquired intangible assets were impaired 
as such  we recorded an impairment charge of million in to fully write off these assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations percentage of net sales year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before taxes provision for taxes net income fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in our revenue growth was driven by overall strong demand for our products and higher new product sales 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in the same period last year 
the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in certain material costs along with lower defective return costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in the spending increase is the result of higher variable costs related to our sales increase  increased new product development spending and a million charge to write off certain intangible assets 
interest expense  net  decreased to million in from million in due to lower borrowing levels 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in the prior year 
the decrease was the result of lower provisions for state income taxes in 
table of contents fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in revenues before the impact of currency exchange and the sale of our canadian subsidiary were up over the prior year 
our revenue growth was driven by overall strong demand for our products and higher new product sales 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in the same period last year 
the increase was the result of lower warranty and product return costs along with a reduction in freight expenses and certain material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in the spending increase was the result of higher variable costs related to our sales increase as well as increased new product development spending and higher incentive compensation expense due to higher earnings levels 
interest expense  net  decreased to million in from million in due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
our effective tax rate increased to in from in the prior year 
the increase was the result of a non recurring million tax benefit realized upon the disposition of our canadian subsidiary in and higher provisions for state income taxes in liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through a combination of cash flow from operations  accounts receivable sales programs provided by certain customers and through the issuance of senior indebtedness through our bank credit facility and senior note agreements 
at december   working capital was million  and shareholders equity was million 
at december   we had no long term debt or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million 
over the past several years we have continued to extend payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers which allow us to sell our accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment terms extensions 
as of december  and december   we sold million and million in accounts receivable  respectively  under these programs and removed them from our balance sheets based upon standard payment terms 
we expect continued pressure to extend our payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable 
we have a million revolving credit facility which expires in june borrowings under the facility are on an unsecured basis with interest at rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points based upon the achievement of certain benchmarks related to the ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
the interest rate at december  was libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under the facility as of december  letters of credit outstanding under the facility as of december  amounted to million 
we had approximately million available under the facility at december  the loan agreement also contains covenants  the most restrictive of which pertain to net worth and the ratio of debt to ebitda 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the loan agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements our business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities  and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have future obligations for future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancellable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letters of credit 
these obligations as of december  are summarized in the tables below in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases construction contracts amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amount committed less than year years years after years letters of credit the company has excluded from the table above unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of the amount and period of payment 
as of december   the company has gross unrecognized tax benefits of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we reported a net source of cash from our operating activities of million in the year ended december  net income  depreciation and a million increase in accounts payable were the primary sources of operating cash flow 
accounts payable increased primarily as a result of higher inventory levels and the timing of payments to our suppliers 
accounts receivable and inventory were the primary uses of cash 
accounts receivable increased million due primarily to higher sales levels 
inventory increased million due to the sales growth and increases in safety stock levels 
investing activities used million of cash in primarily as a result of additions to property  plant and equipment 
capital spending in consisted of tooling associated with new products  upgrades to information systems and scheduled equipment replacements 
in the third quarter of  we began a project to replace our enterprise resource planning system 
this project is expected to cost approximately million in software and installation services over the next years of which million was spent in no disruption to our operations is anticipated 
in addition  we are expanding our distribution facility located in warsaw  kentucky 
the total cost of this expansion will be approximately million  of which million was spent in financing activities provided million of cash in the year ended december   primarily related to the net effect of stock option activity and the repurchase of common stock from our k plan during based on our current operating plan  we believe that our sources of available capital are adequate to meet our ongoing cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
foreign currency fluctuations in  approximately of our products were purchased from vendors in a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value relative to foreign currencies in the future  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase 
the largest portion of our overseas purchases is from china 
the value of the chinese yuan had been relatively constant relative to the us dollar for two years 
however  since june  it has increased approximately relative to the us dollar 
a continued increase in the value of the yuan relative to the us dollar will likely result in an increase in the cost of products that we purchase from china 

table of contents impact of inflation the overall impact of inflation has not resulted in a significant change in labor costs or the cost of general services utilized 
during we experienced significant increases in the cost of materials and transportation costs as a result of commodity price increases and weakness in the us dollar 
the upward pressure on materials and transportation costs eased in as the us economy weakened 
we were able to offset the cost increases with selling price increases and certain cost saving measures  however  we may not be able to do so in the future 
we will attempt to offset further cost increases by passing along selling price increases to customers  through the use of alternative suppliers and by resourcing purchases to other countries 
however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
related party transactions we have a noncancelable operating lease for our primary operating facility from a partnership in which steven l 
berman  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his family members are partners 
total rental payments each year to the partnership under the lease arrangement were million in  and our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions 
in the opinion of our audit committee  the terms and rates of this lease are no less favorable than those which could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  customer credits  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant percentage of our accounts receivable have been  and will continue to be  concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the united states 
our five largest customers accounted for and of net accounts receivable as of december  and december   respectively 
a bankruptcy or financial loss associated with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
revenue recognition and allowance for customer credits 
revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
we record estimates for cash discounts  product returns and warranties  discounts and promotional rebates in the period of the sale customer credits 
the provision for customer credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for customer credits are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold 
actual customer credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts for each period presented 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs 
we provide reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand  forecasted usage  estimated customer requirements and product line updates 
we maintain contact with our customer base in order to understand buying patterns  customer preferences and the life cycle of our products 
changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserves as needed 
goodwill 
we employ a market comparable approach in conducting our annual impairment tests 
earnings multiples of to times ebitda were used when conducting these tests in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

table of contents income taxes 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes takes into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset takes into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new guidance concerning the transfer of financial assets 
this guidance amends the criteria for a transfer of a financial asset to be accounted for as a sale  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets  eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept and provides for new disclosures 
we adopted the new guidance on december  and there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance concerning the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
this new guidance amends current us gaap by requiring ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  amending the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of the vie  modifying the guidance used to determine whether an entity is a vie  adding an additional reconsideration event eg troubled debt restructurings for determining whether an entity is a vie  and requiring enhanced disclosures regarding an entity s involvement with a vie 
we adopted the new guidance on december  and there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance concerning goodwill impairment testing 
this guidance modifies step of the goodwill impairment test under current guidance for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts to require an entity to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the guidance allows an entity to use either the equity or enterprise valuation premise to determine the carrying amount of a reporting unit 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
substantially all of our borrowings as well as our accounts receivable sale programs bear interest rates tied to libor 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility and customer sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable  a change in either the lender s base rate  libor or discount rates under our accounts receivable sale programs would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds thereunder 
a one percentage point increase in libor or the discount rates on our accounts receivable sale program would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt and our accounts receivable financing costs by approximately million annually 
this estimate assumes that our variable rate debt balance and the level of sales of accounts receivable remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period
