item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview our business is organized into three segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as dmc clad  oilfield products and amk welding 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for of our net sales and of our income from operations before consideration of stock based compensation expense  which is not allocated to our business segments 
our oilfield products and amk welding segments accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales  and and  respectively  of our income from operations before stock based compensation expense 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for and of our net sales  respectively  and and  respectively  of income from operation before stock based compensation expense 
our net sales decreased by  or  compared to net sales 
the year to year consolidated net sales decrease reflects a sales decrease of  for our explosive metalworking segment that was partially offset by sales increases of  for our oilfield products segment and  for amk welding 
excluding incremental sales of  from the acquisitions of lri and austin explosives on october  and june   respectively  and the step acquisition of two russian joint ventures that was completed on april   our oilfield products segment reported an increase of  or from its net sales 
income from operations decreased to  in from  in this  decrease reflects a decline in the operating income reported by our explosive metalworking segment of  and an increase in stock based compensation expense of which were partially offset by increases of  and in the operating income reported by our oilfield products and amk welding segments  respectively 
reported consolidated operating income for and for includes amortization expense of  and  respectively  relating to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisition of dynaenergetics  dynaenergetics canada  dynaenergetics us and the russian joint ventures 
our net income decreased by to  in from  in impact of current economic situation on the company 
we were only minimally impacted in by the global economic slowdown 
however  during and  we experienced a significant slowdown in explosive metalworking sales to some of the markets we serve 
the explosion welded clad plate market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a number of heavy industries  including oil and gas  alternative energy  chemicals and petrochemicals  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  and industrial refrigeration 
these industries tend to be cyclical in nature and the current worldwide economic downturn has affected many of these markets 
despite the slowdown we have already seen in certain sectors  including chemical  petrochemical and hydrometallurgy  quoting activity in other end markets remains healthy  and we continue to track an extensive list of projects 
while timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict  we believe that our explosive metalworking segment is well positioned to benefit as global economic conditions improve 
our explosive metalworking backlog  which totaled  at the end of before this business segment began to see a significant decline in booking activity  increased from  and  at december  and september   respectively  to  at december   reflecting a strong rebound in fourth quarter booking levels from previous quarters of based upon the improvement in our december  explosive metalworking backlog and expected year over year increases in sales for both our oilfield and amk welding business segments  we believe that our consolidated net sales could increase by to from the  in consolidated net sales that we reported in net sales explosive metalworking s revenues are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including oil and gas  petrochemicals  alternative energy  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration  and similar industries 
while a large portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects  maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing  oil refining  and aluminum smelting facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand 
oilfield products revenues are generated principally from sales of shaped charges  detonators and detonating cord  and bidirectional boosters and perforating guns to customers who perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and from sales of seismic products to customers involved in oil and gas exploration activities 
amk welding s revenues are generated from welding  heat treatment  and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking includes the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
cost of products sold for oilfield products includes the cost of metals  explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges  detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to in from in after adjusting for the non recurring gain on the step acquisition of two russian joint ventures  our effective tax rate on the remaining pretax income that we reported for was 
income tax provisions on the earnings of nobelclad  nitro metall  dynaplat  dynaenergetics  dynaenergetics canada  dynaenergetics rus  perfoline  and our german and luxembourg holding companies have been provided based upon the respective french  swedish  german  canadian  russian and luxembourg statutory tax rates for the applicable years 
going forward  based upon existing tax regulations and current federal  state and foreign statutory tax rates  we expect our blended effective tax rate on our projected consolidated pre tax income to range between and in before returning to normalized level of to in subsequent years 
backlog we use backlog as a primary means of measuring the immediate outlook for our explosive metalworking business 
we define backlog at any given point in time as consisting of all firm  unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time 
generally speaking  we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following months 
from experience  most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized 
our backlog with respect to the explosive metalworking segment increased to  at december  from  at december  and  at september  based upon this improvement in our explosive metalworking backlog and expected year over year increases in sales for both our oilfield and amk welding business segments  we believe that our consolidated net sales could increase by to from the  in consolidated net sales that we reported in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales percentage change change net sales net sales for decreased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales decreased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the decrease in explosive metalworking sales reflects a business slowdown in several of the industries that this business segment serves 
oilfield products contributed  to sales in of total sales compared to  in of total sales 
excluding incremental sales of  from our acquisitions of lri and austin explosives and the step acquisition of two russian joint ventures  sales increased  or  reflecting a strong rebound in oil and gas drilling activities in north america and other regions of the world 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales  an increase of gross profit percentage change change gross profit consolidated gross profit margin rate gross profit decreased by to  in from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate decreased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking decreased from in to in oilfield products reported a gross margin of in compared to a gross margin of in the gross profit margin for amk welding increased to in from in the decrease in the gross profit margin rate for explosive metalworking reflects a decrease in our us gross margin rate from in to in and a decrease in our european gross margin rate from in to in on year to year sales declines of and  respectively 
while lower sales and the resultant less favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs have negatively impacted gross margins reported by all of our cladding divisions  the significant decline in our us gross margin rate for compared to relates principally to unfavorable changes in product mix and an extremely competitive pricing environment in certain end markets that comprise a significant portion of our sales 
historically  gross margins for our european explosion welding divisions have been lower than those reported by our us division due to less efficient fixed manufacturing cost structures associated with our smaller european facilities and this has again been case during while our european cladding divisions also face a competitive pricing environment  the principal reason for the large decrease in our european gross margin rate for compared to is the decline in sales 
as has been the case historically  we expect to see continued fluctuations in explosive metalworking s quarterly gross margin rates in the future that result from fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and change in product mix 
the increase in oilfield products gross margin relates principally to the significant sales increases that are discussed above and favorable changes in product customer mix 
gross margins reported by the oilfield products segment also reflect the incremental margin on intercompany sales to recently acquired former distributors in canada  the us and russia as these acquired entities sell products through to the end customers 
the increase in amk welding s gross margin relates principally to the sales increase discussed above and associated more favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
based upon the expected contribution to consolidated net sales by each of our three business segments  we expect our consolidated full year gross margin to be in a range of to 
general and administrative expenses percentage change change general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in excluding incremental general and administrative expenses of  that resulted from the acquisitions of lri  austin explosives and the russian joint ventures  our general and administrative expenses decreased by or 
this decrease includes increases of and in salaries and stock based compensation  respectively  which were more than offset by a decrease in accrued incentive compensation and a net decrease of in all other expense categories that reflects the impact of tight controls over discretionary spending 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in selling and distribution expenses percentage change change selling and distribution expenses percentage of net sales selling and distribution expenses  which include sales commissions of in and  in  increased by to  in from  in excluding incremental selling and distribution expenses of  that resulted from the acquisitions of lri  austin explosives and the russian joint ventures  our selling and distribution expenses decreased by  or 
this decrease in our selling and distribution expenses includes decreased selling and distribution expenses of at our us divisions and at our foreign divisions 
the decrease in our foreign divisions selling and distribution expenses relates principally to staff reductions within our european explosion welding facilities and lower sales commissions 
the decrease in our us selling and distribution expenses reflects decreases of and for salaries and accrued incentive compensation  respectively  and a net increase of in other spending categories 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and distribution expenses increased to in from in the increase in selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of sales relates largely to our oilfield products business and the need  particularly in north america  to maintain a number of strategically located distribution centers that are in close proximity to areas which contain a large concentration of oilfields and enjoy a high volume of related oil and gas drilling activities 
amortization expenses percentage change change amortization of purchased intangible assets percentage of net sales amortization expense relates to the amortization of values assigned to intangible assets in connection with our november  acquisition of dynaenergetics  our october  acquisition of lri  our april  acquisition of the two russian joint ventures and our june  acquisition of austin explosives 
amortization expense for includes   and relating to values assigned to customer relationships  core technology  and trademarks trade names  respectively 
amortization expense for includes   relating to values assigned to customer relationships  core technology  and trademarks trade names  respectively 
amortization expense as measured in euros associated with the dynaenergetics acquisition is expected to approximate  in  and amortization expense as measured in canadian dollars associated with the lri acquisition is expected to approximate cad 
amortization expense as measured in euros associated with the acquisition of the two russian joint ventures is expected to approximate in  and amortization expense associated with the austin explosives acquisition is expected to approximate operating income percentage change change operating income income from operations operating income decreased by to  in from  in explosive metalworking reported operating income of  in as compared to  in this decrease is largely attributable to the decrease in net sales and the decline in the gross margin rate as discussed above 
operating results of explosive metalworking for and include  and  respectively  of amortization expense of purchased intangible assets 
oilfield products reported operating income of  in as compared to an operating loss of  in the significant improvement in operating results for our oilfield products segment is attributable to the significant increases in sales and gross profit as discussed above that reflect the incremental sales and gross profit from the acquisitions of lri  austin explosives and the russian joint ventures as well as an increase in global oil and gas drilling activities  particularly in north america 
operating results of oilfield products for and include  and  respectively  of amortization expense of purchased intangible assets 
amk welding reported operating income of  in  an increase of from the  that it reported in the improvement in amk s operating income is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
operating income in and includes  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense 
this expense is not allocated to our business segments and thus is not included in the above and operating income totals for explosive metalworking  oilfield products  and amk welding 
stock based compensation expense in is expected to approximate  gain on step acquisition of joint ventures percentage change change gain on step acquisition of joint ventures n a during the second quarter of  we acquired the remaining non controlling interests in two russian joint ventures that were previously majority owned 
prior to the acquisition date  we accounted for the joint ventures as equity investments 
as a result of the acquisition of the remaining non controlling interests  we now consolidate these entities 
in accordance with accounting standards applicable to transactions of this nature  we determined the fair value of our interests in these joint ventures immediately prior to the purchase and recognized a resultant gain of  other income expense  net percentage change change other income expense  net we reported net other income of in compared to net other expense of in our net other income includes net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains of  including a gain of on our currency swap agreement  and net other income items aggregating our other net expense of relates principally to realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded by our swedish and german subsidiaries 
interest income expense  net percentage change change interest income expense  net we recorded net interest expense of  in compared to net interest expense of  in our interest expense includes a non recurring  non cash charge of related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the march prepayment  in the amount of   euros  of the remaining balance of the euro term loan that was outstanding under our bank syndicate credit facility 
this euro term loan was scheduled to mature on november  the decrease in interest expense is attributable to a significant reduction in average outstanding borrowings that resulted from scheduled term loan payments and the march prepayment of the euro term loan 
interest savings from these term loan reductions were partially offset by higher average interest rates in that relate principally to the october amendment to our bank syndicated credit facility which resulted in an increase in the interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings of per annum 
income tax provision percentage change change income tax provision effective tax rate we recorded an income tax provision of  in compared to  in our income tax provision included a provision of associated with the  non recurring gain that we recorded on the acquisition of non controlling interest in two russian joint ventures as discussed above and a provision of  on the remaining pretax income of  the effective tax rate decreased to in from in due principally to the low tax rate applicable to the non recurring gain on the acquisition of non controlling interest in two russian joint ventures 
our effective tax rate on the  of ordinary pretax income that we reported was 
our consolidated income tax provision for and included  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to net foreign tax benefits of and  in and  respectively  associated with our foreign operations and holding companies 
we expect our blended effective tax rate for to range from to based on projected pre tax income 
adjusted ebitda percentage change change adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure that we believe provides an important indicator of our ongoing operating performance 
our aggregate non cash depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  and represents a significant percentage of the consolidated operating income that we reported for these years 
we use non gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda in our operational and financial decision making and believe that these non gaap measures are a reliable indicator of our ability to generate cash flow from operations and facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of our three business segments than do certain gaap measures 
research analysts  investment bankers and lenders also use ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess operating performance 
the following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebidta 
net income interest expense interest income provision for income taxes depreciation amortization of purchased intangible assets ebitda stock based compensation other income expense  net equity in earnings of joint ventures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the decrease in operating income of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales percentage change change net sales net sales for decreased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales decreased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the decrease in explosive metalworking sales reflects a business slowdown in several of the industries that this business segment serves and includes approximately million of unfavorable foreign exchange translation adjustments 
oilfield products contributed  to sales in of total sales compared to  in of total sales 
the  or decline in sales  which includes incremental sales of  from the lri acquisition  reflects both a volume decrease and a negative impact of approximately from unfavorable foreign exchange adjustments 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales  a decline of gross profit percentage change change gross profit consolidated gross profit margin rate gross profit decreased by to  in from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate decreased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking decreased from in to in oilfield products reported a gross margin of in compared to a gross margin of in the gross profit margin for amk welding decreased to in from in the decreased gross profit margin rate for explosive metalworking relates almost entirely to our european cladding operations where the gross margin rate for the year was lower than the gross margin rate reported in on a year to year sales decline of 
our us clad division reported only a slightly lower gross margin rate of in compared to in despite a drop in sales 
historically  gross margins for our european explosion welding divisions have been lower than those reported by our us division due to less efficient fixed manufacturing cost structures associated with our smaller european facilities 
during the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the fourth quarter to a high of in the first quarter 
the large decrease in oilfield products gross margin relates principally to the sales decline discussed above and resultant less favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses but also includes the impact of non recurring costs associated with the relocation of certain production activities during the second quarter of and year to year changes in product customer mix 
the decrease in the amk welding gross margin relates principally to an increase in manufacturing overhead associated with engineering and product development expenses as amk seeks to expand both its service offerings and customer base 
general and administrative expenses percentage change change general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to  in from  in excluding incremental fourth quarter general and administrative expenses of relating to the october  acquisition of lri which included of transaction related expenses  our general and administrative expenses decreased by  or 
general and administrative expenses of our european divisions decreased by  or  as a result of a decrease in net expenses as measured in euros and in favorable foreign exchange translation adjustments 
our us general and administrative expenses decreased by  or 
the us decrease reflects a increase in stock based compensation expense offset by a decrease in accrued incentive compensation  a reduction of in legal and consulting expenses  and a net decrease of in other spending categories 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in selling and distribution expenses percentage change change selling and distribution expenses percentage of net sales selling and distribution expenses  which include sales commissions of  in and  in  decreased by to  in from  in excluding incremental selling and distribution expenses of associated with the lri acquisition  our selling and distribution expenses decreased by  or 
the  decrease in our consolidated selling and distribution expenses includes decreased selling and distribution expenses of  and  at our european and us divisions  respectively 
the decrease in european selling and distribution expenses relates principally to staff reductions within our european explosion welding divisions and lower sales commissions and also includes of favorable foreign exchange translation adjustments 
the  decrease in our us selling and distribution expenses reflects decreased sales commissions of  a decrease in accrued incentive compensation  a decrease in travel expenses  a decrease in bad debt expense and a reduction in business development  advertising and promotional expenses that were partially offset by a net increase of in other spending categories 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and distribution expenses increased to in from in amortization expenses percentage change change amortization of purchased intangible assets percentage of net sales amortization expense relates entirely to the amortization of values assigned to intangible assets in connection with our november  acquisition of dynaenergetics and our october  acquisition of lri 
amortization expense for includes   and relating to values assigned to customer relationships  core technology  and trademarks trade names  respectively 
amortization expense for includes    and relating to values assigned to order backlog  customer relationships  core technology  and trademarks trade names  respectively 
the value assigned to order backlog was fully amortized during the first six months of operating income percentage change change operating income income from operations operating income decreased by to  in from  in explosive metalworking reported operating income of  in as compared to  in this decrease is largely attributable to the decrease in net sales and decline in the gross margin rate as discussed above 
operating results of explosive metalworking for and include  and  respectively  of amortization expense of purchased intangible assets 
oilfield products reported an operating loss of  in as compared to operating income of  in this  decline is largely attributable to the decrease in net sales and decline in the gross margin rate as discussed above 
operating results of oilfield products for and include  and  respectively  of amortization expense of purchased intangible assets 
amk welding reported operating income of  in  a decrease of from the  that it reported in this decline is largely attributable to the decrease in net sales and decline in the gross margin rate as discussed above 
operating income in and includes  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense 
this expense is not allocated to our business segments and thus is not included in the above and operating income totals for explosive metalworking  oilfield products  and amk welding 
interest income expense  net percentage change change interest income expense  net we recorded net interest expense of  in compared to net interest expense of  in this decrease in net interest expense reflects repayments on term loans with our bank syndicate and a german bank of  and  respectively  and lower average interest rates on our european borrowings 
income tax provision percentage change change income tax provision effective tax rate we recorded an income tax provision of  in compared to  in the effective tax rate increased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to net foreign tax benefits in and net foreign taxes in associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary  nitro metall  as well as dynaenergetics and dynaplat and their related holding companies in germany and luxembourg 
the effective tax rate of is slightly higher than the full year expected tax rate of to that was disclosed at the end of the third quarter and relates to a higher than previously expected contribution to consolidated pre tax income by our us operations 
our us tax rate is higher than the average tax rate for our european subsidiaries 
the effective tax rate of was much lower than our effective tax rate of 
this deviation arose primarily from the completion during the third quarter of of an internal revenue service examination and from adjustments that were identified during the third quarter preparation and filing of our federal and state tax returns 
the closure of the internal revenue service examination enabled us to record previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately net in the book to return adjustments favorably impacted our third quarter tax provision by approximately  and related primarily to apportionment factors utilized to compute state income taxes 
largely as a result of these third quarter tax provision adjustments  our full year blended effective tax rate was reduced to 
adjusted ebitda percentage change change adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure that we believe provides an important indicator of our ongoing operating performance 
our aggregate non cash depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  and represents a significant percentage of the consolidated operating income that we reported for these years 
we use non gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda in our operational and financial decision making and believe that these non gaap measures are a reliable indicator of our ability to generate cash flow from operations and facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of our three business segments than do certain gaap measures 
research analysts  investment bankers and lenders also use ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess operating performance 
the following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda and adjusted ebidta 
net income interest expense interest income provision for income taxes depreciation amortization of purchased intangible assets ebitda stock based compensation other income expense  net equity in earnings of joint ventures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the decrease in operating income of  liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies 
if we are unable to i realize sales from our backlog  ii secure new customer orders at attractive prices  and iii continue to implement cost effective internal processes  our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted 
furthermore  any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
debt facilities in connection with the acquisition of dynaenergetics in  we entered into a five year syndicated credit agreement 
the credit agreement  which provided term loans of  and  euros and revolving credit loan availability of  and  euros  is through a syndicate of seven banks 
there are two significant financial covenants under our credit facility  the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements 
as a result of the slowdown in our business during which continued into the early part of  we were concerned about our ability to comply with these financial covenants as of march  and subsequent quarters of in an effort to alleviate this concern and remain in compliance with financial covenants as of march  and in future periods  we made a march prepayment of the remaining principal balance due under our bank syndicated euro term loan in the amount of   euros and  on april   amended the credit agreement to exclude scheduled principal payments under the euro term loan from fixed charge coverage ratio computations for march  and forward 
as we reached the end of and completed our budget  we were once again concerned about our ability to remain in compliance with financial covenants as of december  and in future quarterly periods of to address this concern  on february   we amended the credit agreement to reduce the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement to to for the trailing four quarter period ended december  and to for any trailing four quarter period thereafter 
the february amendment also increased the maximum leverage ratio for any trailing four quarter period ending after september  to to from to  and increased maximum annual capital expenditure limits for and from million for both years to million for and million for the leverage ratio is defined in the credit facility as consolidated funded indebtedness at the balance sheet date as compared to consolidated ebitda  which is defined as earnings before provisions for income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary  non recurring charges and other non cash charges  for the previous twelve months 
for the years ended december  and  consolidated ebitda approximated the adjusted ebitda that we reported for the respective periods 
as of december   the maximum leverage ratio permitted by our credit facility was to the actual leverage ratio as of december  was to the maximum leverage ratio permitted as of march  june  september and december  is to  to  to and to  respectively 
the fixed charge ratio  as defined in the credit facility  means  for any period  the ratio of earnings available for fixed charges to fixed charges 
earnings available for fixed charges equals consolidated ebitda plus lease expenses minus cash income taxes and maintenance capital expenditures 
fixed charges equals the sum of cash interest expense  lease expense  scheduled principal payments and cash dividends 
as of december   the minimum fixed charge ratio permitted by our credit facility  as amended on february   was to the actual fixed charge ratio as of december  was to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio permitted for the twelve month periods ending march  june  september and december  is to in connection with the october  acquisition of lri  we assumed outstanding debt obligations including line of credit loans  loans with the former owners and capital lease obligations in the amounts of   cad    cad and cad  respectively 
as of december   a us dollar term loan of  was outstanding under our credit facility  was outstanding under term loan obligations of dynaenergetics and  was outstanding under loan agreements with the former owners of lri 
we had  outstanding on our revolving credit borrowings under our syndicated credit agreement and  outstanding under our separate dynaenergetics line of credit agreements 
we had no outstanding balances under the line of credit assumed with the acquisition of lri 
while we had approximately  of unutilized revolving credit loan capacity as of december  under our various credit facilities  future borrowings are subject to compliance with financial covenants that could significantly limit availability 
debt and other contractual obligations and commitments our existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets  and maintenance of specified financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements

cash flows from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities for totaled  significant sources of operating cash flow included net income of  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of  stock based compensation of  and net positive changes in working capital of these sources of operating cash flow were partially offset by a  non cash gain on step acquisition of joint ventures and a deferred income tax benefit of  positive cash flows from changes in working capital included decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and increases in accounts payable of   and  respectively 
these were partly offset by decreases in customer advances and accrued expenses and other liabilities of  and  respectively 
the decreases in accounts receivable and inventories reflect declines of more than in our explosive metalworking segment s accounts receivable and inventory balances that follow the decrease in this segment s sales levels  with these declines being partially offset by increased accounts receivable and inventories in our oilfield products segment  which reflect a strong rebound in this segment s underlying sales and production activity during the last half of the decrease in customer advances reflects the return of customer advances to a more normal level after the inclusion at december  of a  advance from one customer on a large order that was shipped during the increase in accounts payable relates primarily to the timing of inventory purchases and payments while the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities relates to both timing issues and a decrease in accrued incentive compensation

preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
existing rules must be interpreted and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  goodwill and other intangible assets  impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks  income taxes  and stock based compensation expense 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
all issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
products related to the oilfield products segment  which include detonating cords  detonators  bi directional boosters and shaped charges  as well as  seismic related explosives and accessories  are standard in nature 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a probable loss  we will account for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets to be held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple  highly subjective variables  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates  asset lives  and the use of different valuation models and therefore require considerable judgment 
our estimates and assumptions are based  in part  on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data 
these determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances  many of which are subjective in nature  include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy  a significant decrease in the market value of the asset  and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an identifiable intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment as described further below 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
specifically  we test for impairment as follows goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level on at least an annual basis 
a reporting unit is a group of businesses i for which discrete financial information is available and ii that have similar economic characteristics 
we test goodwill for impairment using the following two step approach the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  including market information and discounted cash flow projections  also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the projections incorporate our best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist  and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in the second step  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had just been acquired in a business combination and as if the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
we then compare that implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss for the excess 
our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of did not result in a determination that any of our goodwill was impaired 
the fair value of the oilfield products reporting unit was million at december  compared to its carrying value of million 
a discount rate of was utilized in the income approach component of the model used to measure fair value 
a future impairment is possible and could occur if i operating results underperform what we have estimated or ii additional volatility of the capital markets or other factors should cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market based analysis 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge 
intangible assets subject to amortization an intangible asset that is subject to amortization is reviewed when impairment indicators are present 
we compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with finite lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if the asset is fully recoverable 
if the expected future operating cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we estimate the fair value of the asset 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when the carrying value exceeds fair value 
the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to  among other things  relevant market factors  revenue growth  if any  and operating margins 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses  which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities 
income taxes we are required to recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in our financial statements but not our tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on income tax credits and on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine if they will  more likely than not  be recovered from future projected taxable income  if not  we record an appropriate valuation allowance 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those appearing or disclosed in our financial statements forming part of this annual report  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
forward looking statements this annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigations reform act of these statements include information with respect to our anticipated future financial condition and its results of operations and businesses 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  may  will  continue  project  forecast  and similar expressions  as well as statements in the future tense  identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include the ability to obtain new contracts at attractive prices  the size and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in customer demand  general economic conditions  both domestically and abroad  and their effect on us and our customers  competitive factors  the timely completion of contracts  the timing and size of expenditures  the timely receipt of government approvals and permits  the adequacy of local labor supplies at our facilities  the availability and cost of funds  and fluctuations in foreign currencies 
the effects of these factors are difficult to predict 
new factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess the potential impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date of this annual report  and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
in addition  see risk factors for a discussion of these and other factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates 
periodically  we use interest rate swaps to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of our assets and liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rate risk management 
foreign currency risk our consolidated financial statements are expressed in us dollars  but a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
changes in the exchange rates for such currencies into us dollars can affect our revenues  earnings  and the carrying value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  either positively or negatively 
sales made in currencies other than us dollars accounted for   and of total sales for the years ended   and  respectively
