item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations summary during and the company s operations focused on oil drilling in central and western kansas and in the north dakota bakken oil resource play 
in the company will expand its drilling operations into southwestern nebraska and into oil rich zones in the texas panhandle such as the tonkawa and cleveland 
these zones have become prime horizontal drilling targets 
these activities are discussed in greater detail below 
the company believes that its geographically diverse drilling projects provide an excellent balance for achieving its goal of adding long lived oil and natural gas reserves and production at reasonable costs and risks 
however  it should be expected that successful results will occur unevenly for each of the drilling projects 
drilling economics are dependent on both the timing of drilling and on the drilling success rate 
the company will continue to actively pursue adding reserves through its drilling projects in fiscal  and expects these activities to be a reliable source of reserve additions 
however  the timing and extent of such activities can be dependent on many factors which are beyond the company s control  including but not limited to the availability of oil field services such as drilling rigs  fracture stimulation equipment and related services  as well as access to wells for application of the company s calliope gas recovery system 
the prevailing price of oil and natural gas has a significant effect on demand and  thus  the related cost of such services and wells 
results of operations in  oil and gas revenues increased to  compared to  in the increase was due to a increase in oil prices and a increase in natural gas prices 
as the oil and gas price volume table on page shows  oil prices increased to per barrel and natural gas sales prices increased to per mcf 
the net effect of these price changes was to increase total oil and gas sales by  realized derivative gains were  in compared to  in unrealized derivative losses were  in compared to unrealized losses of  in during the same period  the company s total production decreased to  boe  resulting in a decrease in oil and gas sales of  the decline in oil production resulted because of delays caused by shortages of fracture stimulation equipment for horizontal wells in the north dakota bakken and the texas panhandle 
the situation was exacerbated by the expected flush production decline on the huslig field discovery which peaked last year at about barrels of oil per day  net to credo 
in addition  the company did not drill any gas wells during due to low natural gas prices 
investment and other income increased primarily due to the impact of market place improvements on the company s investments 
in  total costs and expenses  excluding the impairment loss of  in  decreased to  compared to  in oil and gas production expenses decreased due primarily to decreased field level service costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to  primarily due to decreased salaries and benefits and lower legal and professional fees

the variation from the statutory rate in is primarily due to percentage depletion 
in  oil and gas revenues decreased to  compared to  in the decrease was due to a decrease in oil prices and a decrease in natural gas prices

the net effect of these price realization changes was to decrease total oil and gas sales by  realized derivative gains were  in compared to losses of  in during the same period  the company s oil production increased to  barrels  which offset a reduction in gas production to  mcf resulting in an increase in oil and gas sales of  unrealized derivative losses were  in compared to unrealized gains of  in investment and 
table of contents other income decreased primarily due to the impact of market place declines on the company s investments coupled with a liquidation of investments during in  total costs and expenses  excluding oil and gas property and intangible asset impairment charges  increased to  compared to  in oil and gas production expenses decreased due primarily to decreased field level service costs 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  board of director fees and expenses  legal fees and a one time  retirement payment to the chief executive officer in lieu of a  per month retirement annuity 
due primarily to low natural gas prices during the first half of  for the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded non cash ceiling test write downs at the end of the first and second quarters  in the aggregate of  the company also recorded intangible asset impairment charges of  in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources at october   working capital decreased to  compared to  at october   primarily due to capital expenditures for oil and gas activities 
for the year ended october   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  for the same period in the difference is primarily due to the sale of  of short term investments in and the purchase of  in short term investments in during and  the company liquidated the majority of its short term investments in professionally managed limited partnerships 
other short term investments are directly invested in certificates of deposit and mutual funds 
investing activities primarily included oil and gas exploration and development expenditures  including calliope  totaling  and  in and  respectively 
financing activities primarily included the purchase of treasury stock of  and  in and the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization and write downs of oil and gas properties and impairment losses ebitda was  for the year ended october  and  for the prior year 
ebitda is not a gaap measure of operating performance 
the company uses this non gaap performance measure primarily to compare its performance with other companies in the industry that make a similar disclosure 
the company believes that this performance measure may also be useful to investors for the same purpose 
investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda is not a gaap measure  it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

although product prices are key to the company s ability to operate profitably and to budget capital expenditures  they are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict 
since  the company has periodically hedged the price of a portion of its estimated production when the potential for significant downward price movement is anticipated 
these transactions typically take the form of costless collars for oil and forward short positions based upon the nymex futures market for natural gas  and are closed by purchasing offsetting positions 
such contracts do not exceed estimated production volumes and are authorized by the company s board of directors 
contracts are expected to be closed as related production occurs but may be closed earlier if the anticipated downward price movement occurs or if the company believes that the potential for such movement has abated 
the company has elected not to designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  such contracts are recorded at fair value on its balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
at october  the company held open derivative contracts representing natural gas short sales positions for  mmbtus at nymex basis prices ranging from to and covering the production months of november and december the company closed the hedge transaction by purchasing offsetting contracts at nymex basis prices of 
these positions are presented net and represent an unrealized gain of  at october  which was realized as income subsequent to year end 
average natural gas prices received in the company s primary market have historically been below nymex prices due to basis differentials compared to the current differentials of about

in november   the company purchased the calliope patents and the remaining third party rights in the calliope technology 
in addition  the company purchased the patents for its new tractor seal fluid lift technology together with all third party rights in the technology 
the tractor seal technology is currently in the development stage and  except for the patents  the company has not yet provided public disclosure regarding the technology 
the total purchase price was  drilling activities the company owns approximately  gross acres primarily located on the northern shelf of the anadarko basin of oklahoma where it also owns interests in approximately gross net wells  primarily natural gas wells 
historically  the company s drilling has been focused on this natural gas prone area 
however  no gas wells were drilled in oklahoma during due to low gas prices 
future drilling on the oklahoma acreage is primarily dependent on natural gas prices  however  because much of the company s acreage is held by production  the timing of drilling is not critical in terms of preserving most of the company s acreage ownership 
in recent years  the company has significantly expanded both the volume and breadth of its drilling activities with new projects in kansas  nebraska  north dakota s bakken play  and the texas panhandle 
compared to drilling in oklahoma  the north dakota and texas panhandle horizontal drilling projects involve higher costs but significantly higher per well reserve potential 
conventional drilling in kansas and nebraska is less expensive than in oklahoma 
in kansas and nebraska  the company owns interests in approximately  gross acres and  net acres and it is continuing to expand its acreage position 
at october   the company has participated in drilling wells on its acreage  of which over have been successfully completed as producers 
the company is continuing to conduct an active drilling program expected to consist of two to three wells per month with working interests ranging from to 
the company s kansas and nebraska drilling activities provide scientific diversification to the company s drilling program through the use of d seismic to identify shallow oil prospects 
in  the kansas project yielded a significant oil discovery  known as the huslig field  in which the company owns an working interest 
huslig field production peaked at barrels of oil per day  net to credo  which drove the increase in oil production compared to in north dakota s bakken oil resource play  the company has assembled approximately  gross  net acres in the core of the play which are located primarily on the fort berthold reservation  south and west of the parshall field 
the acreage consists of approximately initial well spacing units 
the company expects that more than one well will be drilled on many spacing units 
the project targets horizontal drilling for the bakken and sanish three forks formations 
vertical well depths on the company s acreage are approximately  feet and the horizontal legs are generally expected to range between  and  feet 
the company s interests range from very small to depending on the size of the spacing unit 
to date  five wells have been drilled on the company s acreage 
three of the wells are producing and two are awaiting completion for production 
the company s third high rate bakken producer was recently completed 
the petro hunt a well was drilled on a  acre spacing unit with an approximate  foot lateral  and was fracture stimulated in stages 
the well flowed at a restricted rate of  barrels of oil equivalent during a hour test on a small choke with flowing casing pressure of  psi 
while the well was drilled in fiscal  the completion phase was delayed until recently due to shortages of fracture stimulation equipment 
the well is located in dunn county on the fort berthold reservation about four miles southeast of the company s petro hunt d well 
credo owns an working interest in the new well 

table of contents the company s first bakken well petro hunt d tested at an initial rate of  barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd on a choke  and has produced about  boe in months 
the well is also located in dunn county on the southwest portion of the fort berthold reservation  and appears to be one of the best wells in the area 
credo owns a working interest in the well 
the company s second bakken well brigham weisz tested at an initial rate of  boepd on a choke  and has produced approximately  boe in four months 
the well is located about miles northwest of the petro hunt d in williams county 
credo owns a working interest in the well 
brigham s development plans for the spacing unit could potentially include two additional bakken wells and up to three sanish three forks wells 
drilling is complete on two additional wells located on the fort berthold reservation where credo owns small interests the zenergy well and the questar mha well 
both wells are currently awaiting completion for production 
credo owns and in the wells  respectively 
the company anticipates drilling at least nine wells on its bakken acreage during in the texas panhandle  the company owns an average working interest in about  gross acres 
the company has recently drilled its first horizontal well 
the  foot vertical depth well has an approximate  foot horizontal lateral and is expected to primarily produce oil 
credo owns a working interest in the well with chesapeake energy corporation  the nation s most active driller  as the operator 
drilling and high pressure fracturing have been completed  a pumping unit has been installed  and fracture fluids are currently being recovered 
reserves 
refer to item  properties  significant properties  estimated proved oil and gas reserves and future net revenues  for information regarding oil and gas reserves 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties  the accounting for oil and natural gas reserves  and the estimate of its asset retirement obligations 
derivatives 
the company has elected not to designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  such contracts are recorded at fair value on its balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties 
capitalized costs included in the full cost pool are depleted on an aggregate basis using the units of production method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is a significant component of oil and natural gas properties 
both the volume of proved reserves and any estimated future expenditures used for the depletion calculation are based on estimates such as those described under oil and gas reserves below 
the capitalized costs in the full cost pool are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the 
table of contents ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower depreciation and depletion in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
changes in oil and natural gas prices have historically had the most significant impact on the company s ceiling test 
in general  the ceiling is lower when prices are lower 
even though oil and natural gas prices can be highly volatile over weeks and even days  the ceiling calculation dictates that the average prices in effect as of the first day of each month of the test period be used and held constant 
the resulting valuation is a snapshot as of that day and  thus  is generally not indicative of a true fair value that would be placed on the company s reserves by the company or by an independent third party 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on the company s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on average prices and costs in effect during the preceding year 
oil and gas reserves 
the determination of depreciation and depletion expense as well as ceiling test write downs related to the recorded value of the company s oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves are often different than the estimated costs 
estimates of reserve quantities and values for certain properties must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available 
such properties include wells with limited production histories and properties with proved undeveloped or proved non producing reserves 
in addition  the company s patented calliope system is generally installed on mature wells 
as such  they contain older down hole equipment  such as casing  that is more subject to failure than new equipment 
the failure of such equipment can result in complete loss of a well 
historically  performance of the company s wells has not caused significant revisions in its proved reserves 
one measure of the life of the company s proved reserves can be calculated by dividing proved reserves at fiscal year end by production for fiscal year this measure yields an average reserve life of years 
since this measure is an average  by definition  some of the company s properties will have a life shorter than the average and some will have a life longer than the average 
the expected economic lives of the company s properties may vary widely depending on  among other things  the size and quality  natural gas and oil prices  possible curtailments in consumption by purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
as a result  the company s actual future net cash flows from proved reserves could be materially different from its estimates 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted revisions to its oil and gas disclosure requirements that are intended to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
among other things  the amendments replace the single day fiscal period end pricing assumption with a twelve month average pricing assumption  permit the disclosure of probable and possible reserves  allow the use of certain technologies to establish reserves  require the disclosure of the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the reserves estimates or conducting a reserves audit  require the filing of the independent reserve engineers summary report  and permit the disclosure of a reserves sensitivity analysis table to illustrate the impact of different price and or cost assumptions on reserves 
these amendments are effective for registration statements filed on or after january   and for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  fiscal year for the company with early adoption prohibited 
the company adopted the revisions and amendments effective with this report on form k 
adoption of the new rules did not have a significant impact on the company s reserve quantities 

table of contents intangible assets 
the patents underlying the calliope gas recovery system are carried as a non current asset on the company s balance sheet and are being amortized over the average remaining life of the patents 
the company periodically evaluates this asset to assure that the remaining value is recoverable 
the company believes that the number of future installations will be sufficient to demonstrate recoverability of the cost 
due to various factors  there have been no recent calliope installations 
if the company is unable to achieve the expected level of installations  the company may in the future be required to record an impairment of the asset 
should this event occur  it would be a non cash charge to income and would have no effect on working capital 
asset retirement obligations 
the fasb authoritative guidance requires that the company estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in its consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future abandonment costs  inflation  useful life  and cost of capital 
the nature of these estimates requires the company to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages exposure to commodity price fluctuations by periodically hedging a portion of estimated production when the potential for significant downward price movement is anticipated 
these transactions typically take the form of costless collars for oil and forward short positions based upon the nymex futures market for natural gas  and are closed by purchasing offsetting positions 
such contracts do not exceed estimated production volumes and are authorized by the company s board of directors 
contracts are expected to be closed as related production occurs but may be closed earlier if the anticipated downward price movement occurs or if the company believes that the potential for such movement has abated 
at october  the company held open derivative contracts representing natural gas short sales positions for  mmbtus at nymex basis prices ranging from to and covering the production months of november through december the company also held open offsetting derivative contracts with the same counterparty for  mmbtus at nymex basis prices of and covering the production months of november through december these positions are presented net due to the contractual netting provisions with the counterparty
