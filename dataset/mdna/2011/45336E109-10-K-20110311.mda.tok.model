overview we began in as a reseller of telecommunications services and have evolved to become a leading provider of end to end  cloud based contact center services and network connectivity 
we strive to deliver the most proven solutions quickly and with ease  helping our customers reduce the cost and improve the quality of every user interaction 
in we began offering cloud based call center solutions to the call center market 
our dynamic technology platform provides our customers a solution without the costs and complexities of legacy systems 
our proven delivery model provides cost savings and removes the complexities of deploying and maintaining a premised based solution  while providing flexibility to change with business needs 
we provide software which includes automatic call distribution with skills based routing  interactive voice response with speech recognition  computer telephony integration capabilities  reporting  workforce optimization  e learning  call center agent hiring and customer feedback measurement tools 
taken together  the incontact cloud based platform creates an integrated solution for call centers  including those with distributed workforces either at home or multi site 
our incontact suite over the past several years  we have transitioned from a telecommunications long distance reseller and aggregator into a value added  saas company focused on the contact center market 
we have made a number of 
table of contents strategic acquisitions that we believe have positioned us at the forefront of the rapidly emerging hosted contact center software market 
we began building our all in one contact center solution with the acquisition of an automated call distribution solution  which is now the backbone of our incontact suite  and have been developing and adding to that core technology 
telecom long distance telecommunication and related services remain the majority of our revenue 
as a domestic and international long distance reseller and aggregator  we contract with a number of third party long distance service providers for the right to resell telecommunication services to our customers 
the variety of traditional telecommunication services we offer enables our customers to buy most of the telecommunications services they need from one source  combine those services into a customized package including incontact s all in one  contact center solution  receive one bill for those services  call a single point of contact if service problems or billing issues arise  and depend on our professional team of employees to manage their network and contact center solution  end to end  so our customers can focus on their business operations 
we offer our customers a set of traditional connectivity products  which include the dedicated voice t product  the intelligent t  voip connectivity services and our switched services 
in addition to long distance  toll free  and other traditional telephone services  these connectivity options enable our customers to connect to our voip network and the complete set of incontact suite of services we have available 
our customers publish toll free and local inbound numbers to their users enabling inbound calls to be handled directly or through the incontact suite embedded in the voip network 
our distribution channels pursue multiple marketing avenues  including using independent agents  value added resellers and direct and inside sales forces 
trends in our business the focus of our business operations has shifted dramatically the past three years  resulting in increased revenues from cloud based sales of our incontact suite  and we expect that our software segment revenues will continue to grow as a result of our continued emphasis on this segment of our business 
since when we began a concerted effort to focus our business on developing and marketing our incontact suite  we have seen continued attrition in our traditional telecommunication long distance business 
we expect costs of revenue to continue to decrease as a percentage of sales as we continue to shift our revenues more heavily towards the software segment 
our annual costs of revenue as a percentage of sales were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we are emphasizing the use of referral relationships with adjacent market technology and service providers in our business 
these relationships benefit incontact because they introduce us to new sales channels and they add scalability to our sales  implementation  professional services  and support operations 
these companies are finding us appealing to work with for the following reasons our incontact suite is easily integrated  our direct sales presence gives companies a regional presence  and our strength and experience with the saas model attracts new companies wanting to capitalize on the momentum in this software market 
due to the turmoil in the credit industry and the downturn in the economy in general  we believe more contact centers are going to limit their up front capital expenditures  including purchases of premise based equipment 
we believe this will accelerate the adoption of the cloud based model by contact centers  which in turn will make our hosted incontact suite more appealing to the contact center market 

table of contents we have experienced a trend in the telecommunication industry to increase costs associated with short duration calls 
a short duration call is defined as a call lasting only six seconds or less 
typically a large volume of short duration calls will burden most telephony switches 
as a result  most carriers have applied surcharges to those calls 
we have passed these surcharges on to our customers that have a large number of short duration calls 
although we are uncertain what impact this will have on our long distance customer base  it does have the potential to increase attrition in our long distance segment as customers seek a safe haven from these surcharges until the industry as a whole adjusts 
sources of revenue we derive our revenues from two major business activities hosting and support of our incontact software suite of services and associated professional services and reselling telecommunication services 
since  our primary business focus has been on selling and marketing our incontact software suite 
software software hosting and support of our incontact suite is provided on a monthly basis 
monthly recurring charges are billed in arrears and recognized for the period in which they are earned 
in addition to the monthly recurring revenue  revenue is also received on a non recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a user s incontact suite experience 
customers access cloud based software and data through a secure internet connection 
support services include technical assistance for our software products and product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
our telecommunications and data network is fundamental to our incontact suite and allows us to provide the all in one incontact solution 
telecom we continue to derive revenue from traditional telecommunications services such as dedicated transport  switched long distance and data services 
these services are provided over our network or through third party telecommunications providers 
revenue for the transactional long distance usage is derived based on user specific rate plans and the user s call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated 
users are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period 
if the billing period spans more than one month  earned but unbilled revenues are accrued for incurred usage to date 
costs of revenue and operating expenses costs of revenue costs of revenue consist primarily of payments to third party long distance service providers for resold telecommunication services to our customers 
costs of revenue also include salaries including stock based compensation and related expenses for our hosting  support and professional services organizations  equipment depreciation relating to our hosting services  and amortization of acquired intangible assets  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and allocated overhead  such as rent  utilities and depreciation on property and equipment 
as a result  overhead expenses are included in costs of revenue and each operating expense category 
the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than the cost associated with delivering our software services due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock based compensation and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
we believe it is 
table of contents important to continue investing in selling and marketing to strengthen partner relationships and create lead generation opportunities 
accordingly  selling and marketing expenses could increase in absolute dollars depending on our investment decisions in line with our ongoing assessment of the market opportunity to support additional growth 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of the non capitalized portion of salary including stock based compensation and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  quality assurance  market research  testing  product management  and allocated overhead 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality on a frequent basis  expand our content offerings  upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary including stock based compensation and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease as we continue to leverage our existing general and administrative personnel and other expenses to support our anticipated growth 
general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars may increase or decrease depending upon investments we make to support the size of our business

table of contents segment reporting we operate under two business segments software and telecom 
the software segment includes all monthly recurring revenue related to the delivery of our software applications plus the associated professional services and setup fees related to the software services product features referred to as cloud based or saas 
the telecom segment includes all voice and data long distance services provided to customers 
for segment reporting  we classify operating expenses as either direct or indirect 
direct expense refers to costs attributable solely to either selling and marketing efforts or research and development efforts 
indirect expense refers to costs that management considers to be overhead in running the business 
management evaluates expenditures for both selling and marketing and research and development efforts at the segment level without the allocation of overhead expenses  such as rent  utilities and depreciation on property and equipment

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit note  which expires in july at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition to our million of cash and cash equivalents  subject to meeting covenant requirements  we have access to additional available borrowings under our revolving credit note with zions first national bank zions entered into in july the available borrowings under the revolving credit note are million  based on the maximum available advance amount calculated on the january  borrowing base certificate  resulting in total cash and additional availability under the revolving credit note of million at december  the balance of our revolving credit note at december  was million

in december we received proceeds of million from the sale of stock in december in february  we entered into an equipment leasing facility with zions 
under the terms of the leasing facility  zions agreed to provide us with financing of up to million to lease computer related equipment for our business operations  which zions will lease to us in the form of a capital lease 
the term of the facility is months upon acceptance of the leased property by us 
the interest rate is 
we have million of capital lease obligations related to this leasing facility at december  zions closed the lease at december  and will begin charging interest on the full amount of the leasing facility starting on january  we have open purchase orders at december  of approximately million to purchase computer related equipment to utilize the remaining leasing facility 
the final lease payments will be in december 
table of contents in march  we entered into an equipment leasing facility commitment with zions 
under the terms of the leasing facility commitment  zions has agreed to provide us with financing of up to million to lease computer related equipment for our business operations  which zions will lease to us in the form of a capital lease 
the term of the facility is months upon acceptance of the leased property by us 
the calculated interest rate is subject to change based on the three year london interbank offered rate libor  plus 
we continue to take a proactive approach in managing our operating expenditures and cash flow from operations 
in october of  we took measures to reduce operating expenses  including headcount reductions to accelerate the growth in cash generated from operations 
due in part to these measures  cash generated from operations was million during we believe the savings generated by these measures will continue to generate cash from operations 
we expect to rely on internally generated cash  our revolving credit facility and our equipment leasing facility to finance operations and capital requirements 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit note and available borrowings under our equipment leasing facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements during at least the next twelve months 
revolving credit note on july   we entered into a revolving credit loan agreement the revolving credit agreement with zions 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  zions has agreed to loan up to million under a revolving credit note 
the loan is secured by substantially all the assets of incontact 
we drew million from our revolving credit agreement with zions and paid down million on the revolving credit agreement during all outstanding principal under the zions agreement is due in july the amount outstanding at december  was million 
in january  we paid million of the outstanding balance at december  the zions revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants  with the most significant covenants being a requirement to maintain a specified minimum ebitda defined as earnings before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  a requirement to maintain a minimum working capital balance and a requirement to maintain a minimum cash balance 
in august and march  zions agreed to amend the revolving credit agreement to reduce the required minimum ebitda covenant levels  in order to allow the company to pursue its strategic objectives without breaching the covenant 
remaining in compliance with loan covenants is critical to the company s operations 
based on our projections  we believe we will maintain compliance with our loan covenants through  however if future operating results are less favorable than currently anticipated  the company may need to seek further amendments to modify its loan covenants 
if we are unable to modify the loan covenants on acceptable terms  we would intend to reduce spending levels or take other restructuring actions 
as of march  the ebitda covenant requires minimum ebitda levels of  for the fourth quarter   for the first three quarters of and million for each quarter thereafter 
the minimum working capital covenant requires minimum working capital of million at all times during the term of the agreement and the minimum cash balance covenant requires a minimum cash balance of million or the amount available under the line is reduced to of billed accounts receivable 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants related to the revolving credit agreement for the period ended december  the interest rate under the zions revolving credit note is day libor plus  adjusted as of the date of any change in the libor 
interest under the revolving credit note is paid monthly in arrears  and all principal is due in july the balance outstanding under the revolving credit note cannot exceed the lesser of a million or b the sum of of eligible billed receivables  and of eligible earned but unbilled receivables  as calculated on the th and th of each month

during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was primarily used for capitalized software development and other property and equipment 
cash used in financing activities was  and was due to payments on long term debt offset by proceeds received from the exercise of options and warrants 
we had an overall net decrease in cash of  during the year ended december  the amount that we have invested in our expansion has provided additional network capacity and additional resources to help grow our incontact suite

open purchase orders at december  of approximately million to purchase computer related equipment to utilize the remaining million leasing facility with zions 
our purchase commitments are with national long distance telecommunication providers 
we have one purchase commitment that provides for a monthly minimum of  which can be terminated with a thirty day written notice 
we exceeded our monthly minimums with this carrier in we have a commitment with another carrier that requires an annual usage commitment of  through august that we feel we will meet based on our current usage patterns 
fair value measurements the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices 
fair value measurements do not include transaction costs 
we adopted accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  on january  this guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework to measure fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc establishes a fair value 
table of contents hierarchy used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values 
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
auction rate preferred securities auction rate preferred securities arps were our only assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc at december  we classified the investment in arps as a level investment as these securities have significant unobservable inputs 
the fair value of the investment in arps as of december  was  we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of december  this analysis considers  among other items  the collateralization of the underlying securities  the expected future cash flows and the expectation of when the security will be redeemed by the issuer 
the securities were redeemed by the issuer in february for  these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
warrants effective january   we adopted newly promulgated accounting guidance related to whether a derivative instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock new derivative accounting guidance 
the application of the new derivative accounting guidance can affect the accounting for warrants and many convertible instruments with provisions that protect holders from a decline in the stock price or down round provisions 
down round provisions reduce the exercise price of a warrant or convertible instrument if a company either issues equity shares for a price that is lower than the exercise price of those instruments or issues new warrants or convertible instruments that have a lower exercise price 
we evaluated whether warrants to acquire our stock contain provisions that protect holders from declines in the stock price or otherwise could result in modification of the exercise price and or shares to be issued under the respective warrant agreements based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a fixed for fixed option 
we determined that the  warrants  expiring in may  issued to comvest capital in conjunction with the revolving credit note and term loan agreement contained such provisions  and concluded they were not indexed to our own stock 
accordingly  on january  we began recognizing these warrants issued to comvest the comvest warrants as liabilities at their respective fair values on each reporting date 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for these warrants of  was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit at january  the cumulative effect adjustment was the difference between the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheet before initial adoption of the new derivative accounting guidance and the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet upon the initial application of the new derivative accounting guidance 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as a result of the initial application of the new derivative accounting guidance on january  were determined based on the amounts that would have been recognized if the new derivative accounting guidance had been applied from the issuance date of the warrants 
we measured the estimated fair value of these warrants as of december   and recorded a  charge during the year ended december  to record the liabilities associated with these warrants at their estimated fair values totaling  as of that date 
we measured the estimated fair value of these warrants as of december   and recorded a  gain during the year ended december  to record the liabilities associated with these warrants at their estimated fair values totaling  as of december  we estimated the fair values of these securities using a black scholes valuation model  which approximated a lattice valuation model 

table of contents critical accounting estimates revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue is determined and recognized based on the type of service that is provided for the customer as follows incontact suite of services 
revenue is derived from the use of any of our incontact suite of services that are provided on a monthly recurring basis 
the all in one incontact solution includes features such as skills based routing  automated call distribution  self service menus  speech recognition based automated interactive voice response  database integration with contact handling technology  multimedia contact management voice  fax  e mail and chat  management reporting features  workforce management features  performance optimization benchmarking  custom call routing and call flow design  and new hire screening and online training tools 
monthly recurring charges are generally billed in arrears and recognized for the period in which they are earned 
in addition to the monthly recurring revenue  revenue is also received on a non recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a customer s incontact suite experience 
for sales contracts with multiple elements hosted software  training  installation and long distance services  we follow the guidance provided in asc  revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  because customers do not have the right to take possession of our hosted software 
as such  these arrangements are considered service contracts and are not within the scope of industry topic  software 
asc allows companies to recognize revenues upfront for delivered elements of a contract when it has objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements of the contract 
however  because we have not established stand alone value for our professional services the delivered element nor objective and reliable evidence of fair value for our incontact suite of services the undelivered element  we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services  such as training and installation the delivered elements  and recognize such fees as revenue over the term of the contract  which is generally to months 
accordingly  we have recorded  of deferred revenue at december  and million of deferred revenue at december  fees for long distance services in multiple element arrangements with the incontact suite of services are based on usage and are recognized as revenue in the same manner as fees for traditional long distance services discussed in the following paragraph 
traditional long distance services 
revenue is derived from traditional telecommunications services  such as dedicated transport  switched long distance and data services 
these services are provided over our network or through third party telecommunications providers 
our network is the backbone of our incontact application and allows us to provide the all in one incontact solution 
revenue for the transactional long distance usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer s call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated 
customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period 
if the billing period spans more than one month  unbilled revenues are accrued for incurred usage to date 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is composed of billed amounts as well as unbilled amounts for which revenue has been earned and recognized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  an estimate of the amount of accounts receivable outstanding of which management believes may be uncollectible  is determined each month principally based on the aging of receivables 
management reviews the current trends and aged receivables periodically and adjusts the estimated bad debt expense to accrue for doubtful accounts as needed 
an account is written off by management when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts may continue 

table of contents long lived assets we estimate the useful lives of long lived assets in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
depreciation and amortization expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
long lived assets consist of property and equipment computer equipment  software  furniture and equipment 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than carrying values 
intangible assets we estimate the useful lives of intangibles  which include acquired customer lists  patents and acquired technology  in order to determine the amount of amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
we use an accelerated method to amortize customer lists acquired after other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
we test intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than carrying values 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product  and or the partial or complete lapse of continuing technology rights protection 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis on september of each year and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the fair values are estimated using a market based valuation approach utilizing a multiple of revenues 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments  including judgments about relevant revenue multiples of comparable companies 
we have two reporting units identified as our segments  telecom and software 
all of the goodwill of million relates to the software reporting unit 
therefore  only the carry value of the software reporting unit was evaluated 
if the carrying value of the software reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired in the amount that that the goodwill balances exceed the calculated fair value 
at september   the fair value of the software reporting unit exceeded its carrying value so no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended december  there were no events or circumstances from the date of our assessment through december  that would impact this assessment 
income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred income tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
to date  a valuation allowance has been recorded to eliminate the deferred income tax assets 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment  and it is difficult to predict when  if ever  our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
the amounts relating to taxes also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions  however  tax audits  changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes 
management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters 
however  to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts  we may be required to adjust our tax amounts resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
however  we have purchase commitments with two national long distance telecommunication providers and our operating leases 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires measurement of compensation cost for equity based 
table of contents awards ie  stock options  warrants and restricted stock units at fair value on date of grant and recognition of the fair value of compensation for awards expected to vest over the requisite service period 
we utilize the graded vesting method  rather than a straight line method  for recognizing compensation expense as management believes this graded vesting method more closely matches the expense to associated services 
under this method  nearly of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a typical three year vesting term 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
management considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the short term nature of the cash equivalents  we believe that we are not subject to any material interest rate risk as it relates to interest income 
interest rates on some of our outstanding leases and revolving credit facility are variable so market fluctuations in interest rate may increase our interest expense
