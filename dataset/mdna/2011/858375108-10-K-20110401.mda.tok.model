the million charge related to a change in the process and timing of our physical inventories  as well as accelerating one half of our stores inventory observations to mid year from year end 
asset impairment and store closing charges are reflected in all years  but were significantly lower in fiscal income tax for fiscal was favorably impacted by the reversal of the remaining deferred tax valuation allowance established in fiscal reconciliations of operating and net income loss on a gaap basis to adjusted operating and net income loss on a non gaap basis are presented in the following table operating income net income operating income net income operating loss net loss income loss gaap basis adjustments cumulative breakage gain  net of inventory charge asset impairment and store closing charges valuation allowance for deferred tax assets reversal initial adjusted income loss non gaap basis asset impairment and store closing charges  including costs to relocate stores  are as follows asset impairment charges lease termination costs  net severance costs total compared to net sales for the year ended january  were  million  a decrease of percent from  million for the million decrease reflects a million decrease in the comparable store group and a million decrease in the closed store group  offset by a million increase in the non comparable store group due to the inclusion of sales for a total of four stores opened in and the closed store group includes stores closed in and stores closed in comparable stores sales for decreased percent compared to gross profit for the year ended january  was million or percent of net sales compared to million or percent of net sales for the million decrease in gross profit reflects a million decrease in the comparable store group and a million decrease in the closed store group  offset by a million increase in the non comparable store group 

table of contents gross profit as a percent of sales decreased during primarily due to a percent of sales increase in markdowns and negative leverage on lower sales

store expense reductions include a million decrease in personnel expenses resulting from our new supply chain process  a million decrease in other store operating and depreciation expenses and a million decrease due to the elimination of operating costs from closed stores 
other store operating expenses were lower as a result of continued cost savings initiatives 
depreciation expense was lower as a result of asset impairment charges taken at the end of fiscal advertising spend was higher to increase our marketing impact 
asset impairment charges were million higher in due to more store closings and a greater number of stores with projected cash flows that did not support the carrying value of their long lived assets which required a write down of their assets 
store closing charges were million lower this year because there were fewer store closings and this year includes an offsetting million gain on a lease buyout by a landlord for the early termination of a lease 
other income  net for increased million to million from million in during the second quarter of  we recognized million of other income related to cumulative breakage on unused gift and merchandise return cards since the inception of these programs 
prior to the second quarter of  we had not recognized breakage on card balances pending our final determination of the interpretation of the escheat laws applicable to our operations and historical redemption patterns 
the remaining increase in other income was from our magazine subscription program and breakage income recognized in the second half of we had a small amount of interest income in compared to net interest expense in as a result of having no direct borrowings since the first quarter of the income tax provision for was favorably impacted by the reversal of the remaining million deferred tax asset valuation allowance established in in the fourth quarter of  we were no longer in a cumulative three year loss position because the company s income in the last two years exceeded the loss incurred in excluding this favorable tax adjustment  the effective tax rate etr was percent in compared to percent in the rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of percent due to the impact of favorable changes in book tax differences on our valuation allowance prior to the year end reversal and favorable settlements of state income tax examinations 
the etr was lower than the federal statutory rate of percent due to the effect of certain book tax differences on the valuation allowance including a tax accounting method change made in the third quarter of we expect our etr to be approximately percent

gross profit as a percent of sales increased during fiscal due to a percentage point decrease in markdowns and a percentage point increase in markup  offset by a percentage point decrease in buying and occupancy costs 
markdowns were lower in due to lower inventory levels and lower levels of clearance merchandise 
sg a expenses were million or percent of net sales for the year ended january  as compared to million or percent of net sales for sg a expenses for include million of non cash pre tax asset impairment and store closing charges compared to million in asset impairment charges were million higher last year due to a greater number of stores with projected cash flows that did not support the carrying value of their long lived assets 
store closing charges were million higher last year because two closings occurred before the end of the lease term resulting in higher store closing reserve charges for continuing lease obligations 

table of contents excluding asset impairment and store closing charges  sg a expenses were million or percent of sales in compared to million or percent of sales in this million decrease in sg a expenses reflects a million reduction in store operating expenses  a million decrease in non buying expenses in the corporate office  a million decrease in depreciation expense and a million decrease in advertising expense 
store operating expenses decreased million for the comparable and non comparable store group due to headcount reductions and other cost saving initiatives and decreased million for the closed store group 
corporate office expenses decreased from primarily due to compensation and benefit reductions related to expense reduction initiatives and lower consulting fees 
depreciation expense decreased as a result of asset impairment charges taken during the fourth quarter of advertising expense was slightly lower this year primarily due to reduced spending on direct mail marketing and newspaper advertising 
pre opening expenses for the two stores opened in and the six stores opened in amounted to million and million  respectively 
other income  net decreased million in compared to due to a decrease in the number of credit cards issued through our co brand credit card program offset slightly by income from our new magazine subscription program 
interest expense  net decreased million in compared to as a result of our having no direct borrowings since the first quarter of during the third quarter of  we borrowed an additional million on our revolving credit agreement which increased our notes payable to banks balance to million 
we maintained that notes payable balance through january   investing excess borrowings in short term money market funds  and liquidated these money market funds and repaid that portion of the borrowings during the first quarter of the effective tax rate etr was percent in compared to a tax benefit of percent in the rate was unusually low due to our recording a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance through a charge to tax expense during the fourth quarter of we recorded the valuation allowance because operating results produced a cumulative three year loss  which is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome when determining if a valuation allowance is required 
although we were profitable in  we remained in a cumulative three year loss 
we perform a quarterly assessment of net deferred tax assets and plan to carry a valuation allowance until such time that positive evidence is sufficient to justify realization 
the etr was lower than the federal statutory rate of percent due to the effect of certain book tax differences on the valuation allowance including a tax accounting method change made in the third quarter of liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is the sale of merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds  available cash  credit terms from vendors and a revolving credit facility 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  our working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth quarter as we build inventories for the holiday selling season 
as of january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million in we did not use our revolving credit facility in and had no direct borrowings at the end of either year 
we paid a special dividend of per common share  or million  in december net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities decreased million from the decrease was primarily due to million more cash used for inventories and accounts payable and million less cash from income tax receivable payable including million of net operating loss carry back refunds in 
inventories at january  were million higher than at january  primarily due to higher inventory balances in our warehouse and distribution centers 
the timing of receipts and vendor payments increased accounts payable at the end of this year compared to last year 
operating cash flows for increased million over the increase was primarily due to million more cash provided by net income plus non cash charges and a million increase in cash provided by income taxes receivable payable including million of net operating loss carry back refunds received during  offset by million more cash used for inventories and accounts payable and million more cash used by other operating activities 
while the end of year inventory balance was only slightly higher compared to  accounts payable was higher at the end of due to approximately million of merchandise in distribution centers at the end of that was received earlier than at the end of as part of our new supply chain network 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities  solely for capital expenditures  was million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for include approximately million for systems improvements  with the largest portion for our new merchandise information system 
the remaining capital amounts are for improvements in our point of sale system  upgrades to store fixtures and for new and relocated stores 
capital expenditures for compared to reflect a decrease in the number of store openings 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in we paid million in dividends in and had no activity on our revolving credit agreement 
more cash was used in for the repayment of all direct borrowings under our credit agreement while had cash provided by net borrowings on the credit agreement 
we expect to invest approximately to million in capital expenditures in the cost of opening a new store ranges from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately  we have a million senior revolving secured credit agreement the agreement with a group of lenders which extends through january we expect to enter into a new credit agreement before the end of the amount available for borrowing was million at january  and is based on a percentage of eligible inventories less reserves  as defined in the agreement 
availability was further reduced to million after deducting outstanding letters of credit of million 
we had no direct borrowings at january  and are in compliance with the terms of the agreement 
we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  which  along with our available cash and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement  will provide the means needed to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at january  in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations a total a represent open purchase orders with vendors for merchandise not yet received and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the above table does not include long term debt as we did not have any direct borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility at january  other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  deferred compensation  deferred rent liability  postretirement benefit liability and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments for these closed stores total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements we have outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at january  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  we would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  we do not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect our financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require adjustments of these estimates in future periods 
a summary of the more significant accounting policies follows 

table of contents retail inventory method and inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we perform physical inventory counts at all stores annually 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical physical inventory results as a percentage of sales for the year 
the difference between actual and estimated amounts in any year may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
vendor allowances 
we receive allowances from some of our vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursement  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
vendor allowances are recorded when earned 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold in the later of the period that the merchandise markdown is incurred or the allowance is negotiated 
allowances received from vendors related to damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to the cost of merchandise as it is received 
allowances received due to compliance issues primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise when compliance issues are identified during the receiving process 
although it is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if a reduction were to occur  we could experience higher cost of merchandise sold 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value  as used in our asset impairment calculations  is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
based on our historical experience  the resale value of used fixtures and equipment is de minimis and since we lease all our store locations  our leasehold improvements cannot be sold in a market transaction  and therefore have little to no fair value 
impairment reviews are performed for individual stores during the fourth quarter  or more frequently should circumstances change 
a significant change in cash flows could result in an increase in asset impairment charges 
during  we recorded million in pre tax asset impairment charges related to stores closed in  stores closing in and certain other under performing stores 
store closing costs 
we record costs associated with store closing activities when they are incurred  generally the cease use date 
lease termination costs are recorded net of estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the properties 
in the event we are not successful in subleasing closed store locations  additional store closing costs may be recorded 
during  we recorded million in pre tax store closing charges related to stores closed or relocated in insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
we are responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
as of january  and january   insurance reserves of million and million  respectively  were included in accrued liabilities 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in trends and other actuarial assumptions have not been significant in  and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
income tax accounting guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
we perform a quarterly assessment of our net deferred tax assets to determine realization 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets because operating results produced a cumulative three year loss  
table of contents which is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome when determining if a valuation allowance is required per asc topic  income taxes 
although we were profitable in  we remained in a cumulative three year loss 
in the fourth quarter of  we were no longer in a cumulative three year loss position because the company s income in the last two years exceeded the loss incurred in based on this information  along with our expectations of future earnings  we reversed our remaining valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of our valuation allowance also decreased during due to favorable changes in our net deferred tax asset position related to favorable book tax differences estimated for of the million decrease in our valuation allowance for the year  million was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the remainder related primarily to a decrease in deferred tax assets associated with stock based compensation recorded in prior years for which a tax benefit was not realized 
the valuation allowance was and million at january  and january   respectively 
income tax reserves 
we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income taxes 
these liabilities reflect our best estimate of our ultimate income tax liability based on the tax code  regulations  and pronouncements of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions 
if actual results differ from estimated results  our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued guidance impacting the determination of when individual deliverables included in an arrangement with multiple deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting 
the guidance  which was incorporated into asc topic  revenue recognition  eliminates the residual method of allocation for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   however early adoption is permitted 
we will use this new guidance to account for our co brand credit card consumer program agreement 
we plan to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of and do not anticipate it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our revolving credit facility which are at variable rates 
the facility permits debt commitments up to million  has a january maturity date and bears interest at spreads over the prime rate and libor 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility during
