additionally  the fixed charge coverage ratio exceeded to each indenture governing our senior unsecured notes and debentures and our guarantee of the million of sunbelt notes allows a specific level of secured debt  above which security must be provided on each indenture and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes 
the receivables sale facility and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes are not considered debt under the covenants associated with our senior unsecured notes and debentures 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  including foreign exchange contracts along with trade accounts receivable  subject us to potential credit risk 
concentration of credit risk for trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers constituting our customer base and their distribution among many industries and geographic locations 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to forward foreign exchange contracts in the event of non performance by the counter parties to these financial instruments

pension and post retirement obligations relate to our us and international pension and other post retirement plans 
purchase obligations are primarily comprised of service agreements related to telecommunication  information technology  utilities and other manufacturing plant services and certain capital commitments 
we expect to maintain existing levels of available capital resources and meet our cash requirements in expected sources of cash in include cash from operations  available funding under our receivables sale facility if needed  cash distributions from equity affiliates and proceeds from the sale of previously closed facilities and redundant assets 
expected uses of cash in include interest payments  cash taxes  contributions to our defined benefit pension plan  debt retirements  environmental remediation at inactive and formerly owned sites and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are currently estimated to be polyone corporation

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
based on current projections  we believe that we will be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures and that cash provided by operating activities  along with available borrowing capacity under our receivables sale facility  should allow us to maintain adequate levels of available capital resources to fund our operations and meet debt service and minimum pension funding requirements for both the short and long term 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are described more fully in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
polyone corporation 
table of contents polyone corpor effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions pension and other post retirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement plans in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
included in our results of operations are significant amounts associated with our pension and post retirement benefit plans that we measure using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
these assumptions are updated at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  when making these assumptions 
changes in pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the value of future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to the volatility of market conditions 
to develop our discount rate  we consider the yields of high quality  fixed income investments with maturities that correspond to the timing of our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return on plan assets  we consider our historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we consider the duration of the plan liabilities and give more weight to equity investments than to fixed income securities 
the weighted average discount rates used to value our pension and other post retirement liabilities as of december  were and  respectively 
as of december   an increase decrease in the discount rate of basis points  holding all other assumptions constant  would have increased or decreased accumulated other comprehensive income and the related pension and post retirement liability by approximately million 
an increase decrease in the discount rate of basis points as of december  would result in a change of approximately million in net periodic benefit cost 
the weighted average expected return on assets was for  and the expected return on assets is a long term assumption whose accuracy can only be measured over a long period based on past experience 
a variation in the expected return on assets by basis points as of december  would result in a change of approximately million in net periodic benefit cost 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we follow the guidance in asc  intangibles goodwill and other  and test goodwill for impairment at least annually  absent a triggering event that would warrant an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of the first day of october of each year 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  was million 
we have identified our reporting units at the operating segment level or in some cases one level below the operating segment level 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of two valuation methods  the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding projected economic and market conditions  growth rates  operating margins and cash expenditures 
the market approach requires us to make assumptions and judgments to identify comparable publicly traded companies  trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and projected ebitda 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges 
based on our annual impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the corresponding carrying value by at least 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million associated with the trade name acquired as part of the acquisition of gls 
we have estimated the fair value of the gls tradename using a relief from royalty payments approach 
this approach involves two steps estimating reasonable royalty rate for the tradename and applying this royalty rate to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the tradename 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to impairment charges related to our indefinite lived tradenames

table of contents polyone corpor effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in addition  deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we recognize net tax benefits under the recognition and measurement criteria of asc topic  income taxes  which prescribes requirements and other guidance for financial statement recognition and measurement of positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns 
we record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income that we will ultimately generate in the future and other factors such as the interpretation of tax laws 
this means that significant estimates and judgments are required to determine the extent that valuation allowances should be provided against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances as of december  aggregating million against such assets based on our current assessment of future operating results and these other factors 
although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  which could result in gains or losses that could be material 
environmental liabilities based upon estimates prepared by our environmental engineers and consultants  we have million accrued at december  to cover probable future environmental remediation expenditures 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available and our view of the most likely remedy 
depending upon the results of future testing  the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken  changes in regulations  new information  newly discovered conditions and other factors  it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued 
however  such additional costs  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
our estimate of this liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
changes during the past five years have primarily resulted from an increase in the estimate of future remediation costs at existing sites and payments made each year for remediation costs that were already accrued 
if further developments or resolution of these matters are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period

see note  share based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  future employee turnover rates and risk free rate of return 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
for sars granted during and  the option pricing model used was the black scholes method 
we determine the fair value of our sars granted in based on a monte carlo simulation method 
we determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the average of the high and low grant date market price of our stock 
management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of share based compensation awards 
polyone corporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates on debt obligations and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use these derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate exposure on july   we fully repaid the million of outstanding borrowings and also terminated the related commitments under our credit agreement 
because this was our only variable rate debt  we currently have no significant exposure to changes in market interest rates 
to help manage borrowing costs  we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements 
under these arrangements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts on agreed upon notional principal amounts 
as of december   there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exposure we enter into intercompany lending transactions that are denominated in various foreign currencies and are subject to financial exposure from foreign exchange rate movement from the date a loan is recorded to the date it is settled or revalued 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts  which had a fair value of million at december  gains and losses on these contracts generally offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
we face translation risks related to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
net sales and expenses in our foreign operations foreign currencies are translated into varying amounts of us dollars depending upon whether the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our net sales and expenses from foreign operations as expressed in us dollars
