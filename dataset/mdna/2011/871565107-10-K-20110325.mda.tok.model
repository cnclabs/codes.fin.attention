item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts   as of january   for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and for disputed claims and quality issues 
if the financial condition of any of the customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
as of january   the company has  accrued for inventory obsolescence and market reserves 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note e to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company has accrued  as of january   in environmental remediation costs which  in management best estimate  are expected to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note e 
expenditures related to costs currently accrued are not discounted to their present values and are expected to be made over the next three to four years 
however  as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and necessary remediation of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
changes in information known to management or in applicable regulations may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances  also referred to as triggering events  indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset or group of assets the assets may no longer be recoverable 
triggering events include a significant decline in the market price of the assets  a significant adverse change in the operating use or physical condition of the assets  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate impacting the assets value  including regulatory issues such as environmental actions  the generation by the assets of historical cash flow losses combined with projected future cash flow losses  or  the expectation that the assets will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of the useful life of the assets 
the company concluded that there were no indications of impairment requiring further testing during the year ended january  if the company concluded that  based on its review of current facts and circumstances  there were indications of impairment  then testing of the applicable assets would be performed 
the recoverability of the assets to be held and used is tested by comparing the carrying amount of the assets at the date of the test to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets over the remaining useful life of the assets 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  the company uses projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company s projected net cash flows  which are derived using the most recent available estimate for the reporting unit containing the assets tested 
several key assumptions would include periods of operation  projections of product pricing  production levels  product costs  market supply and demand  and inflation 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of the assets are not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value 
assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the assets are disposed or use has ceased 
the company has goodwill of  recorded as part of its acquisition  in  of manufacturers soap and chemical company  operating within the chemicals segment  and  recorded as part of its acquisition in  of ram fab  inc  operating within the metals segment 
goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  is to be tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded  with its carrying amount 
if the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized and the second step  which is a calculation of the impairment  is not performed 
however  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge equal to the difference in the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded 
implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
in making our determination of fair value of the reporting unit  we rely on the discounted cash flow method 
this method uses projections of cash flows from the reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company s projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive these assumptions used in our testing from several sources 
many of these assumptions are derived from our internal budgets  which would include existing sales data based on current product lines and assumed production levels  manufacturing costs and product pricing 
we believe that our internal forecasts are consistent with those that would be used by a potential buyer in valuing our reporting units 
the wacc rate is based on an average of the capital structure  cost of capital and inherent business risk profiles of the company 
the assumptions used in our valuation are interrelated 
the continuing degree of interrelationship of these assumptions is  in and of itself a significant assumption 
because of the interrelationships among the assumptions  we do not believe it would be meaningful to provide a sensitivity analysis on any of the individual assumptions 
however  one key assumption in our valuation model is the wacc 
if the wacc  which is used to discount the projected cash flows  were higher  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would decrease 
conversely  if the wacc were lower  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would increase 
changes in any of the company s other estimates could also have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit s assets 
based on the company s goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  each reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value  therefore no further testing was required and no impairment loss was recognized 
the company believes that if impairment charges should occur with respect to its existing assets  the charges would not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  if business conditions at any of the plant sites were to deteriorate to an extent where cash flows and other impairment measurements indicated values for the related long lived assets  including goodwill  were less than the carrying values of those assets  significant impairment charges could be necessary

accounts receivable increased by  in  net of reserves  reflecting a percent increase in sales in the fourth quarter of over the fourth quarter of in addition  accounts payable increased  in  resulting primarily from the timing of the receipt of and payment for stainless steel raw materials by the metals segment at year end 
also negatively impacting cash flows in was a decline in accrued expenses at the end of compared to the end of of  as advances from customers prepayments from customers used to purchase raw materials required for piping systems projects declined  and a customer product claim was paid during for  these amounts were partially offset by higher accruals for profit based incentives of  reflecting higher profits earned in compared to cash flows provided by operations during totaled  of which  came from continuing operations 
this compares to cash flows provided by operations during of  and  from continuing operations  or increases in cash flows of  and  from to  respectively 
cash flows from continuing operations in were generated from net income totaling  before depreciation and amortization expense of  cash flows were also positively impacted in by a  decrease in the company s inventories  as inventories declined  net of reserves  from  at the end of to  at the end of almost all of the decrease occurred in the metals segment  primarily as a result of the significant declines in stainless steel pipe unit selling prices and volumes sold coupled with declines in cost from stainless steel surcharges  discussed further in the metals segment comparison of to below 
cash flows were also positively impacted from a decrease in accounts receivable of  in compared to  reflecting a percent decline in sales in the fourth quarter of  offset by a decrease in accounts payable of  in compared to  resulting primarily from the decline in the costs of raw materials discussed above combined with the timing of the receipt of and payment for stainless steel raw materials by the metals segment at year end 
cash flows were negatively impacted in by a decline of  in accrued expenses at the end of compared to the end of  as advances from customers prepayments from customers used to purchase raw materials required for piping systems projects declined  and accruals for profit based incentives declined  reflecting the reduction in profits earned in compared to  offset by a  increase in a claims reserve in the metals segment as discussed further in the metals segment comparison of to below 
in  the company s current assets increased  and current liabilities increased  from the year ended amounts  which caused working capital for to decrease by  to  from the total of  the current ratio for the year ended january   decreased to from the year end ratio of the company also used cash during to fund capital expenditures of  which included  for the purchase in june of the land and buildings of ram fab to complete the acquisition 
also  during  the company paid a dividend on march  and another dividend on december  total cash outlay for the dividends amounted to  the company expects that along with the existing amount of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments if any  fund estimated capital expenditures of  and have sufficient resources to expand into other business opportunities 
on june   the company entered into a credit agreement with a regional bank to provide a  line of credit that expires on june  the company s previous debt facility  with a different lender  was going to expire at the end of interest on the new credit agreement is calculated using the one month libor rate  plus a pre defined spread  which is determined by the company s total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to an amount equal to a borrowing base calculation that includes eligible accounts receivable  inventories and cash surrender value of the company s life insurance 
additionally  the credit facility requires an agreement not to pledge the fixed assets of the company 
covenants under the new agreement include maintaining a certain funded debt to ebitda ratio  a minimum tangible net worth  and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
the company will also be limited to a maximum amount of capital expenditures per year  which is in line with the company s currently projected needs 
management does not believe that these covenants and restrictions will have an adverse effect on its operations 
results of operations comparison of to for  the company generated net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  compared to net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  in the prior year 
the company generated net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of  or loss per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of the company did not have discontinued operations for but generated a net loss from discontinued operations of  or loss per share  and a net loss of  or loss per share  for the fiscal year and fourth quarter of  respectively 
as a result  the company earned  or per share  and  or per share  for the fiscal year and fourth quarter of  respectively  compared to net earnings of  or per share  and a net loss of  or loss per share  for the same periods in consolidated gross profits from continuing operations increased percent to  in  compared to  in  and as a percent of sales increased to eleven percent of sales in compared to nine percent of sales in most of the improvement in dollars and in percentage of sales was attributable to the metals segment as discussed in the metals segment comparison of to below 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expense for increased by  compared to  and was six percent and nine percent of sales for and  respectively 
the dollar increase resulted primarily from including a full year of selling and administrative costs for ram fab in compared to four months in also  management incentive bonuses  which are based on profits  increased in compared to comparison of to for the fiscal year ending january   the company generated net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  compared to net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  in the prior year

as a result  the company earned  or per share  and lost  or per share  for the fiscal year and fourth quarter of  respectively  compared to net earnings of  or per share  and a net loss  or per share  for the same periods in consolidated gross profits from continuing operations declined percent to  in  compared to  in  and as a percent of sales decreased to nine percent of sales in compared to eleven percent of sales in the decreases in dollars and in percentage of sales were attributable to the metals segment as discussed in the metals segment comparison of to below 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expense from continuing operations for decreased by  compared to  but increased to nine percent as a percent of sales from six percent 
the dollar decrease in when compared to resulted primarily from a  decrease in management incentives  which are based on profits  coupled with a  decline in environmental expenses  which were favorably impacted by the divestiture of part the chemical businesses

gross profit for increased percent to  or nine percent of sales  from year end s total of  or six percent of sales 
operating income for was  compared to an operating loss of  for sales for the fourth quarter of increased percent to  from sales of  in the fourth quarter of  resulting from a percent increase in unit volumes and a percent increase in average selling prices 
the segment had a gross profit of  or eleven percent of sales  for the fourth quarter of compared to a gross profit of  or one percent of sales  for the fourth quarter of the segment generated operating income of  in the fourth quarter of compared to an operating loss of  for the fourth quarter of the large unit volume improvement for compared to was essentially the result of increased commodity pipe sales resulting from an aggressive effort to gain market share combined with a modest increase in non commodity products 
although sales prices per pound increased about percent for both commodity and non commodity products  the change in product mix to a much higher percentage of commodity pipe resulted in the modest overall selling price increase 
operating income for also reflects a  charge during the first quarter for a product claim made by a metals segment customer and  was expensed for this claim in   of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter unit volumes increased as a result of the aforementioned aggressive marketing effort partially offset by lower non commodity unit sales 
fourth quarter s selling prices  when compared to s fourth quarter  reflects primarily much higher prices for non commodity products resulting from selling more expensive special alloys 
higher stainless steel prices and a change in product mix to a higher percent of lower priced commodity pipe also impacted the average selling price 
the improvement in fourth quarter operating income came primarily from our fabricated piping systems operations 
piping systems backlog was  at the end of the fourth quarter of compared to  at the end of the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  and was five percent of sales compared to six percent of sales for and  respectively 
the dollar increase was attributable to including a full year of ram fab s selling  general and administrative expense during compared to only four months for since ram fab was acquired by the company on august  also  higher incentive based bonuses were earned for based upon the higher profits for the current year 
comparison of to metals segment the metals segment sales decreased percent for the year from a percent decline in average selling prices  coupled with a percent decline in unit volumes 
sales for the fourth quarter decreased percent compared to from a percent decline in average selling prices  coupled with a twelve percent decline in unit volumes 
the segment experienced operating losses of  and  for the year and fourth quarter of compared to a profit of  for the year and a fourth quarter loss of  in the same periods in  respectively 
sales of commodity pipe were down percent and percent for the year and in the fourth quarter  as average selling prices declined percent and percent and unit volumes decreased percent and percent for the year and in the quarter  respectively  compared to the same periods of non commodity pipe and piping systems also experienced declines in sales for the year and fourth quarter  down percent and percent respectively 
the decrease in sales for the year resulted from a percent decline in average selling prices and a nine percent decrease in unit volumes 
the decrease for the quarter resulted from a percent decline in average selling prices  offset by a percent increase in unit volumes  when compared to the fourth quarter of the volume increase for non commodity pipe and piping systems in the fourth quarter resulted primarily from the acquisition on august   of ram fab 
the significant decreases in selling prices together with unit volume declines in both commodity and non commodity pipe and piping systems  without including ram fab and when compared to the same periods in  reflect the decrease in demand for these products resulting from the worldwide economic turmoil and recession 
this contributed to the large decline in both gross profit and operating income for compared to  and to the losses incurred in the fourth quarters of both and stainless steel surcharges  resulting primarily from the changes in nickel prices  peaked in october of after incrementally increasing over the six month period from may to october  and fell slightly over the next three months 
the surcharge averages remained at levels equal to approximately half of s averages throughout most of although we cannot precisely calculate the effect of the price declines  we estimate that they reduced profits by about  for compared to the lower volumes also generated unabsorbed manufacturing costs and taken together with the lower selling prices and unit volumes  caused commodity pipe to incur losses for the year and fourth quarter of responding to the poor economy  many of the piping systems customers extended their delivery dates throughout causing a decline in both dollar and unit volume sales compared to last year  and creating manufacturing inefficiencies throughout the segment 
the piping systems operations benefitted in from the completion of several favorable contracts  primarily in the lng market  which generated significant volume  revenues and profits in as a result of these factors  non commodity pipe and piping systems experienced significant reductions in sales and profits compared to the same periods of also contributing significantly to the segment s losses for the year and fourth quarter of was the accrual of a claim from a customer who is alleging that the segment delivered defective pipe in which the customer removed and replaced 
while we believe the claim is unwarranted  and we are vigorously defending it  approximately  in claims expense was recorded in  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter 
all of these factors taken together caused the segment to incur losses for the year and fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or eleven percent in when compared to  but increased to six percent of sales in compared to four percent of sales in the dollar decrease came primarily from decreased management incentives  which are based on profits

operating income declined one percent to  for the fourth quarter of compared to  for the fourth quarter of the sales gain came from increases in the sulfated product line and additives for dust control and agricultural chemicals 
contract manufacturing also contributed to the sales growth 
the declines in gross profit and operating income for the fourth quarter of  when compared to the same period in  were caused primarily by our inability to pass on all of the increases in raw material costs  especially from naturally occurring fats and oils and petroleum derivatives 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or seven percent in compared to the amount  and decreased to seven percent of sales in from eight percent of sales in the increase resulted primarily from increased selling commissions from the increase in sales in compared to plus higher incentive based bonuses for the current year 
comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment s operating income for the year increased percent to  on sales of  compared to operating income of  on sales of  in operating income for the fourth quarter of increased percent to  on sales of  compared to operating income of  on sales of  for the fourth quarter of during  the segment experienced rising raw material and energy costs throughout the year and while management increased prices in an effort to offset the cost increases  the increases were not sufficient to prevent the cost increase from impacting profitability 
during  the increases in raw material and energy costs abated and in some cases actually declined  forcing management to lower selling prices  which caused the sales decline for the year 
however  price levels remained at levels allowing the segment to maintain a higher level of profitability in compared to the segment experienced strong sales volumes in the majority of its markets throughout the fourth quarter of  which contributed to the increases in sales and profits achieved in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year 
on october   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with santolubes manufacturing  llc sm to sell the specialty chemical business of blackman uhler specialties  llc bu for a purchase price of  along with certain property  plant and equipment held by synalloy corporation for a purchase price of  all located at the spartanburg  sc location 
the purchase price of approximately  payable in cash  was equal to the approximate net book values of the assets sold as of october   the effective date of the sale  and the company has recorded a loss of approximately  resulting primarily from transaction fees and other costs related to the sale 
divesting bu s specialty chemicals business  which had annual sales of approximately  has freed up resources and working capital to allow further expansion into the company s metals businesses 
bu along with organic pigment s op pigment dispersion business  which was sold on march  and had annual sales of approximately  were both physically located at the spartanburg facility 
op completed all operating activities at the end of the third quarter 
as a result  these operations  which were previously included in the specialty chemicals segment  are being reported as discontinued operations 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or two percent of sales in compared to the amount  and increased to eight percent of sales in from seven percent of sales in the increase resulted primarily from increased management incentives  which are based on profits 
unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note m to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  for the schedule that includes these items 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense decreased  or percent  to  or one percent of sales  for  compared to  or two percent of sales  in the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in environmental expenses that were eliminated by the sale of bu at the end of the third quarter of there was no environmental expense during  compared to  in the remainder of the decrease resulted from lower performance based bonuses for higher bonuses were awarded in due to the ram fab acquisition and bu op disposition 
interest expense in decreased  from as a result of lower outstanding debt balances during compared to other expense for the prior year reflects a  medical settlement with a former employee of the company s augusta  georgia chemical operation which was closed in no similar charge occurred in the current year 
comparison of to corporate unallocated corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of include a  favorable adjustment from the reversal of accrued environmental remediation liabilities on projects at the company s spartanburg location that were completed in the quarter 
in addition  corporate expenses in the quarter were favorably impacted by reduced quarterly environmental charges of approximately  that were eliminated by the sale of bu at the end of the third quarter of unallocated corporate expenses for the year and fourth quarter also declined over last year s totals for the same periods as a result of no management incentive in  which is based on profits 
contractual obligations and other commitments as of january   the company s contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows amounts in thousands payment obligations for the year ended total thereafter obligations revolving credit facility interest payments operating leases purchase obligations deferred compensation total for a description of the deferred compensation obligation  see note f to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
current conditions and outlook management is very pleased with achieving substantial increases in sales and profits in both our segments during a period of slow economic activity 
the metals segment business is highly dependent on its customers capital expenditures which have been significantly impacted by economic conditions 
stainless steel surcharges  which affect our costs of raw materials and selling prices  have increased consistently through june  dropped slightly for the third quarter but increased during the fourth quarter of and are projected to increase for the first quarter of while the project and specialty products activities have been soft  there is some recent increase in these sectors 
we believe we are the largest and most capable domestic producer of non commodity stainless steel pipe and an effective producer of commodity stainless steel pipe which should serve us well in the long run 
we also continue to be optimistic about the piping systems business over the long term 
approximately percent of the piping systems backlog comes from paper  water and wastewater treatment projects 
piping systems backlog was  at january  compared to  at the end of we estimate that approximately percent of the backlog should be completed over the next months 
the higher sales levels the specialty chemicals segments experienced during should continue into business conditions continue to be strong in our markets 
management will continue to monitor raw material cost increases and control spending in order to minimize their effect on segment profitability
