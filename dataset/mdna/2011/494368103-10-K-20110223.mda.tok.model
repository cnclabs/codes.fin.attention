in addition  certain products are sold to converters 
net sales to wal mart stores  inc were approximately percent in both and  and percent in patents and trademarks we own various patents and trademarks registered domestically and in many foreign countries 
we consider the patents and trademarks which we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products to be material to our business 
consequently  we seek patent and trademark protection by all available means  including registration 
raw materials cellulose fiber  in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered waste paper  is the primary raw material for our tissue products and is a component of disposable diapers  training pants  feminine pads and incontinence care products 
superabsorbent materials are important components of disposable diapers  training and youth pants and incontinence care products 
polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics  which are used in disposable diapers  training and youth pants  wet wipes  feminine pads  incontinence and health care products  and away from home wipers

we consider the supply of these raw materials to be adequate to meet the needs of our businesses 
see item a  risk factors 
competition we have several major competitors in most of our markets  some of which are larger and more diversified than us 
the principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty  product innovation  quality and performance  price  and marketing and distribution capabilities 
for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business  see item a  risk factors 

table of contents part i continued research and development research and development expenditures are directed toward new or improved personal care  tissue  wiping  safety and health care products and nonwoven materials 
consolidated research and development expense was million in  million in and million in foreign market risks we operate and market our products globally  and our business strategy includes targeted growth in asia  latin america  the middle east and eastern europe 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of foreign market risks that may affect our financial results 
environmental matters total worldwide capital expenditures for voluntary environmental controls or controls necessary to comply with legal requirements relating to the protection of the environment at our facilities are expected to be as follows millions of dollars facilities in us facilities outside us total total worldwide operating expenses for environmental compliance  including pollution control equipment operation and maintenance costs  governmental payments  and research and engineering costs are expected to be as follows millions of dollars facilities in us facilities outside us total total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures  consolidated earnings or competitive position 
these expected amounts do not include potential remediation costs associated with our pulp and tissue restructuring plan see recent developments as the outcome related to the streamlining  sale or closure of the to facilities is not known 
current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans  changes in legal requirements  including any requirements related to global climate change  or other factors

risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control 
any of the risks discussed below  as well as factors described in other places in this form k  or in our other filings with the sec  could adversely affect our business  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward looking statements 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 
significant increases in prices for raw materials  energy  transportation and other necessary supplies and services  without corresponding increases in our selling prices  could adversely affect our financial results 
increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials  including pulp and petroleum based materials  the cost of energy  transportation and other necessary services  supplier constraints  an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters  power outages  labor strikes  governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change concerns  and the like could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
cellulose fiber  in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper  is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets 
cellulose fiber  in the form of fluff pulp  is a key component in our personal care products 
increases in pulp prices could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices 
derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 
a number of our products  such as diapers  training and youth pants  incontinence care products  disposable wipes and various health care products  contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum 
these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices  availability and other factors 
we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers 
significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials 
derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 
although we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate  global economic conditions  supplier capacity constraints  natural disasters and other factors including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses could affect the availability of  or prices for  those raw materials 
our manufacturing operations utilize electricity  natural gas and petroleum based fuels 
to ensure that we use all forms of energy cost effectively  we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites 
our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price  payment terms  quantities and duration 
our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of 
table of contents part i continued particular forms of energy  energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses 
there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources 
derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 
increased pricing pressure  intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we compete in intensely competitive markets against well known  branded products and low cost or private label products both domestically and internationally 
inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance  the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels  and competitive reaction 
our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers  low cost manufacturers and rapidly expanding international manufacturers 
these competitors may have greater financial resources and greater market penetration  which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices 
alternatively  some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs  allowing them to offer products at a lower cost 
the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results 
it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions  each of which could adversely affect our financial results 
our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences  develop and fund technological innovations  and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection 
in addition  we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies 
the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace 
if a product gains consumer acceptance  it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities  introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that we will be successful in advertising  marketing  timely launching and selling our products 
global economic conditions  including recessions or slow economic growth  and continuing global credit market volatility  could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results 
unfavorable global economic conditions  including the impact of recessions  slow economic growth  economic and pricing instability and credit market volatility  may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results 
these economic conditions could negatively impact consumer demand for our products  including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private label products  demand by businesses for our products  including effects of increased unemployment and cost savings efforts of those customers  the mix of our products sales  and our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers 

table of contents part i continued ongoing volatility in global commodity  currency and financial markets has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment 
we rely on access to the credit markets  specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets  to provide supplemental funding for our operations 
although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access the credit markets  it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing the credit markets in the future  which may disrupt our businesses or further increase our cost of funding our operations 
prolonged recessions  slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue  margins and earnings 
changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace  which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large format retailers and discounters 
with the consolidation of retail trade  especially in developed markets such as the us  europe and australia  we are increasingly dependent on key retailers  and some of these retailers  including large format retailers  may have greater bargaining power 
they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability 
we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to shelf space  delisting of our products  additional requirements related to safety  environmental  social and other sustainability issues  and other conditions 
if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to hire  develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
our strategy includes a focus on hiring  developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce 
a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation  as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base 
we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills 
unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions  or to hire and retain a diverse  skilled workforce  could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit  develop and retain the key personnel that we need 
our international operations are subject to foreign market risks  including foreign exchange risk  currency restrictions and political instability  which may adversely affect our financial results 
because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in countries  with products sold in more than countries  our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks 
we are subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries 
we are subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar 
a portion of the exposures  arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non local currencies  is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 
weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollar based input costs for operations outside the us there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents part i continued in addition  we face increased risks in our international operations  including currency restrictions  adverse political and economic conditions  legal and regulatory constraints  tariffs and other trade barriers  risks of expropriation  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results
