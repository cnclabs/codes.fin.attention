item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains certain forward looking information 
see special note regarding forward looking statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements 
our financial statements are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with us gaap 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company and through our indirect majority owned prc subsidiaries  shandong taibang and guizhou taibang  and our minority owned prc investee  huitian  we are principally engaged in the research  development  manufacturing and sales of plasma based pharmaceutical products in china 
shandong taibang operates from our manufacturing facility located in tai an  shandong province and guizhou taibang operates from our manufacturing facility located in guiyang city  guizhou province 
our minority owned investee  huitian  operates from its facility in shaanxi province 
the plasma based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in china is highly regulated by both the provincial and central governments 
accordingly  the manufacturing process of our products is strictly monitored from the initial collection of plasma from human donors to finished products 
our principal products include our approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products 
we are approved to sell human albumin ml  ml  ml  ml  ml  ml and ml 
human albumin is our top selling product 
sales of these human albumin products represented approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively  for the each of the years ended december   and human albumin is principally used to increase blood volume while immunoglobulin  one of our other major products  is used for certain disease preventions and cures 
the company s approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products use human plasma as the basic raw material 
albumin has been used for almost years to treat critically ill patients by replacing lost fluid and maintaining adequate blood volume and pressure 
all of our products are prescription medicines administered in the form of injections 
we sell our products to customers in the prc  mainly hospitals and inoculation centers directly or through approved distributors 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of short term arrangements and our largest customers have changed over the years 
for the years ended december   and  our top customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
for the years ended december   and  our largest customer accounted for approximately  and  of our revenue  respectively 
as we continue to diversify our geographic presence  customer base and product mix  we expect that our largest customers will continue to change from year to year 
we operate and manage our business as a single segment 
we do not account for the results of our operations on a geographic or other basis 
financial performance highlights we continued to experience strong demand for our products and services during the fiscal year ended december   which resulted in revenue and net income growth 
the following are some financial highlights for the year sales sales increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for gross profit gross profit increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to for year from for income from operations income from operations increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for net income net income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for fully diluted net income per share fully diluted net income per share was for the year ended december   as compared for principal factors affecting our financial performance the following are key factors that affect our financial condition and results of operations and we believe them to be important to the understanding of our business raw material supply and prices the primary raw material used in the production of our albumin and immunoglobulin products is human plasma 
collection of human plasma in china is regulated and  until  only licensed plasmapheresis stations owned and operated by the government could collect human plasma 
each collection station was only allowed to supply plasma to the one manufacturer that has signed the quality responsibility statement with them 
the price of human plasma is negotiated on an annual basis and is determined by a number of factors including  but not limited to  the cost of operating the collection stations  the nutritional supplement fee awarded to the donors for each donation  and the anticipated volume of total plasma donated 
however  in march  the ministry of health promulgated certain measures on reforming plasma collection stations  or the blood collection measures  whereby the ownership and management of prc plasma stations are required to be transferred to plasma based biopharmaceutical companies while the regulatory supervision and administrative control remain with the state 
plasma stations that did not complete their reform by december   risked revocation of their license to collect plasma 
in december  we acquired five of the six then existing plasma stations in shandong and on january  we obtained the permits to operate these stations 
these acquisitions have allowed us to have a direct influence on the operation of these collection stations and secure a stable source of plasma supply for production 
the foregoing acquisitions  as well as the acquisition of dalin and its indirectly owned plasma stations  have led to an increase in our plasma supply for production and did not result in any material differences in our cost structure 
due to current market conditions  we have generally been able to pass substantially all cost increases in recent years on to our customers 
prices of and demand for our products in recent years  due to increased regulatory restrictions and market demand  we have been able to increase the selling price of most of our key products 
the demand for our products is largely affected by the general economic conditions in china because they are still not affordable to many patients 
as china economy grows  we expect more chinese people will become consumers of medical treatments and procedures  including procedures requiring human plasma 
a significant improvement in the economic environment in china will likely improve consumer income which in turn would make our products more affordable and consequently increase the demand for our products 
we have been able to expand our product range and markets by introducing new products required by customers 
we believe that our technical expertise is important in introducing products that are in demand 
production capacity our sales volume is limited by our annual production capacity 
as we grow our business in the future  our ability to fulfill additional and larger orders will depend on our ability to increase our production capacity 
our plan to expand our production capacity will depend on  inter alia  the availability of capital to meet our needs of expansion or upgrading of production lines  and the availability of stable plasma supply 
as of december   the aggregate production capacity of shandong taibang and guizhou taibang was  metric tons per annum 
we estimate that the production capacity of our major competitors ranges from tons to  tons per annum 
we believe that our current production capacity is sufficient to meet the current demand for our products for the next two years 
competition we are subject to intense competition 
there are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of potential substitute or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in the prc 
these competitors may have more capital  better research and development resources  manufacturing and marketing capability and experience than we do 
in our industry  we compete based upon product quality  product cost  ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical capabilities 
we believe that we have strengthened our position in the marketplace with our acquisition of dalin and its majority owned operating subsidiary  guizhou taibang  and a equity interest in huitian  a xi an based biopharmaceutical company 
our profitability may be adversely affected if i competition intensifies  ii competitors drastically reduce prices  iii prc government s interference on prices  or iv competitors develop new products or product substitutes with comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects which are more effective or less costly than those produced by us 
please refer to item  business competition for more information regarding this factor 
taxation china biologic is subject to united states tax at a tax rate of 
no provision for income taxes in the united states has been made as china biologic has no income taxable in the united states 
logic express was incorporated in the bvi  but is not subject to taxation in that jurisdiction 
logic holdings was incorporated in hong kong and under the current laws of hong kong  are subject to a profits tax of 
however  no provision for hong kong profits tax has been made as logic holdings has no taxable income 
according to the prc central government policy  new or high technology companies will enjoy preferential tax treatment of  instead of under the eit law 
on december   shandong taibang received the new technology or high technology certification from shandong provincial government 
the certification allows shandong taibang to receive the preferential income tax rate  for a period of three years starting from january  guizhou taibang enjoyed the preferential income tax rate of also under the year western development tax concession  which started on january and ended on december the prc tax authority is studying the possibility of extending the concession  especially for those industries that are encouraged by the prc government  such as ours 
in the event that prc tax authorities discontinue the concession  guizhou taibang will apply for the new or high technology preferential tax treatment of like shandong taibang 
see item  business regulation taxation for a detailed description of the eit law and tax regulations applicable to our prc subsidiaries

 sales 
our sales are derived primarily from the sales of human albumin and various types of immunoglobulin 
our sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to sales of  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in sales during fiscal year is primarily attributable to a general increase in the price and volume of plasma based products 
among the factors that contributed to the growth in revenue  foreign exchange translation accounted for of the increase 
most of our approved products recorded price increases ranging from to  except for human albumin products  which decreased by 
the decrease in the price of human albumin in is primarily due to the increased volume of imported human albumin products in the prc market during the period 
we expect that this trend may continue as long as the volume of the imported human albumin products continue to grow 
for the fiscal year ended december   the average price for our approved human albumin products  which contributed to our total revenue  decreased  the average price for our approved human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection  which contributed to our revenue  increased  the average price for our approved human tetanus immunoglobulin  which contributed to our revenue  increased  the average price for our approved human rabies immunoglobulin  which contributed to our revenue  increased  and the average price for our approved human hepatitis b immunoglobulin  which contributed to our revenue  increased  as compared to the same period in the price increase of our products was primarily attributable to the continuing shortage in supply of the plasma based products 
we were able to adjust our production plan to take advantage of the limited market supply of plasma resources to realize higher profit margins 
volume in sales for our human albumin  human hepatitis b immunoglobulin  human rabies immunoglobulin products and human tetanus immunoglobulin products increased by   and  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the same period in volume in sales for our human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection decreased by  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the same period in  because in the market demand for human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection increased due to the outbreak of hand foot mouth disease and the price of human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection was also much enhanced 
as a result we used the large amount of factor ii iii  the material segregated from plasma and restored separately when making centralized production of human albumin in  to produce and sell high volume of human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection in the volume in sales for human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection decreased to a comparatively normal level in cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  during the same period in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to during the increase in cost of sales is due to the increase in sales  while the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales is due to a change in the mix of products  as well as the price increase in most of the products  that were sold during gross profit and gross margin 
the gross profit increased by  or  to  for the fiscal year ended december  from  for the same period in as a percentage of sales revenue  our gross profit increased by to for the fiscal year ended december   from for the increase in gross profit is due mainly to increases in the selling price and sales volume of our products during  as compared to operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in our research and development expenses  a increase in our selling expense and an increase in our general and administrative expenses during as a percentage of sales revenue  total expenses increased by to for the fiscal year ended december  from for selling expenses 
for the fiscal year ended december   our selling expenses increased to  from  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  our selling expenses for the fiscal year ended december  increased by  to  from for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in selling expenses is primarily due to an increase in our promotional and conference activities as we continue our efforts in expanding our customer base into hospital and inoculation centers throughout the prc 
general and administrative expenses 
for the fiscal year ended december   our general and administrative expenses increased to  from  for the fiscal year ended december   a  or increase 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by to for fiscal year from for the fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the increases in legal expense  non cash employee compensation  travel and general office expenses as we continue to our efforts to integrate our two main operating entities  as well as and inventory allowance  which were offset by the decrease in payroll 
the increase in legal expense is due to the  settlement of a law suit with henan xintai and the  settlement of a law suit with sin kyung ye as described under item  legal proceedings 
non cash employee compensation for the fiscal year ended december  increased by  to  from  for  as a result of the amortization of the grant of stock options to the company s senior management staff in the january  february and july of research and development expenses 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  our research and development expenses were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the cost associated with the development of two new products that are at the end of their respective development stage 
we expect to receive sfda approval for these two new products in change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
the embedded derivatives including the conversion option in our senior secured convertible notes and warrants that were issued in june are classified as derivative liabilities carried at fair value 
for the year ended december  and  the company recognized a loss on the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of  and  respectively 
the recognized loss on the change in the fair value for the fiscal year ended december  is mainly due to the company s stock price increase from to  which increased the fair value of derivative instruments  as of december  and december   respectively 
future changes in the market price of our common stock could cause the fair value of these derivative financial instruments to change significantly in future periods 
interest expense income  net 
our net interest expense decreased  to  for the year ended december   from interest expense of  for the same period in the decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to our payment of a related party loan related to the acquisition of dalin in the second quarter of  conversion of million of our outstanding convertible notes in and and an increase in interest income from our short term deposits with financial institutions 
income tax expense 
our provision for income taxes increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  and our effective tax rate was 
the decrease in effective tax rate is mainly due to the decrease of million in change in fair value of derivative liabilities that is not tax deductible 
among the increase in income taxes  million is due to the dividend tax imposed by prc tax authorities on dividends distributed by our two main operating entities to logic express during the period 
net income 
our net income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in net income as a percentage of sales was and for the year ended december  and  respectively  as a result of the foregoing factors 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  primarily consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations  augmented by short term bank borrowings and equity contributions by our stockholders 
we expect that cash on hand  funds generated from our operations and funds generated from companies that we may acquire in the future will be sufficient to satisfy our current and future commitments for at least the next twelve months 
we do not believe that we have any significant short term liquidity problems 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated cash flow all amounts in us dollars year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities  effects of exchange rate change in cash   net increase in cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year  cash and cash equivalent at end of the year   operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million net cash provided by operating activities for the net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  was mainly due to the net income of million and offset by cash outflow for inventory and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
the cash outflow for inventory is a direct result of the implementation of the day quarantine period by the prc government  which caused a longer staging period for its raw material plasma inventory 
as the company increased its sales directly to the end users  hospitals and inoculation centers with extended credit term  we experienced a slower turn over with our accounts receivable 
investing activities our use of cash for investing activities is primarily for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangibles  and advances on non current assets 
net cash used for investing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was million  as compared to million in during the fiscal year ended december   we paid million to acquire a new company  ziguang bio tech company  paid the final million payment for the acquisition of equity in dalin  million for equipment for shandong taibang and million for our plasma companies buildings and construction in progress in guizhou taibang 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million net cash provided by financing activities in the increase of the cash used in financing activities was mainly attributable to the million dividend paid by our subsidiaries to the noncontrolling interest holder  repayment of a non controlling shareholder loan of million  repayment of short term bank loan of million and offset by short term bank loans and proceeds from warrants conversion of million and million  respectively 
management believes that the company has sufficient cash on hand and continuing positive cash inflow  from the sale of its plasma based products in the prc market 
our management expects continued growth in revenues throughout the term of the convertible notes  largely due to the ongoing limited supply of plasma based products in the prc market due to the introduction of more stringent health and safety measures which we already meet 
in light of the foregoing  we believe that the company will have the financial ability to fulfill its payment obligations under the convertible notes when they come due 
obligations under material contracts the following table sets forth our material contractual obligations as of december  all amounts in thousands of us dollars payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years convertible notes   due to related parties   operating lease obligations    total     critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of fixed assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the fair value determinations of financial and equity instruments and stock compensation awards  assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  the realizability of deferred tax assets and inventories  the recoverability of goodwill  intangible asset  land use right and property  plant and equipment  and accruals for income tax uncertainties and other contingencies 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company mainly sells human albumin and human immunoglobulin to hospitals  inoculation centers and pharmaceutical distributors 
the company requires a contract or purchase order which specify pricing  quantity and product specifications for all sales 
delivery of the product occurs at the point in time the product is received by the customer  which is when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
delivery is evidenced by a signed customer acceptance form 
sales are presented net of any discounts given to customers 
for the year ended december  and  there were no significant sales return from the customers of the company 
fair value measurements on january   the company adopted fasb accounting standard related to fair value measurements and began recording financial assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels 
the company considers the carrying amount of cash  receivables  payables including accrued liabilities and short term loans to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable  their stated rates of interest are equivalent to interest rates currently available 
the fair values are measured pursuant to the three levels defined by the fasb accounting standard as follow level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instruments 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value 
the fair value of the embedded conversion option in the notes of december  and was determined based on the binominal option pricing model  using the following key assumptions december  december  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate time to maturity in years expected volatility fair value of underlying common shares per share the fair values of the warrants outstanding as of december  and were determined based on the binominal option pricing model  using the following key assumptions december  december  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate time to maturity in years expected volatility fair value of underlying common shares per share accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio 
in establishing the required allowance  management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the customers financial condition  the amount of receivables in dispute  and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
depending on the relationship and the creditability of the distributors  we generally grant a credit period of no longer than days to distributors with some exceptions 
for hospitals and clinics  we generally grant a credit period of no longer than days 
we had a bad debt credit of million for  a bad debt expense of million for and a bad debt credit of million for related to the sales of our products 
the million bad debt credit for both and is due to recovery of bad debt previously reserved 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
cost of work in progress and finished goods comprise direct materials  direct production costs and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity 
the company reviews its inventory periodically for possible obsolete goods and cost in excess of net realizable value to determine if any reserves are necessary 
as of december  and  the company wrote off  and  relating to obsolete raw material plasma that may not qualify for production due to the day quarantine period rules implemented by state food and drug administration on july stock based compensation the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
the fair value of each option granted on may   july   january   february  and july  are estimated on the respective dates of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following major assumptions granted on may  july  january  february  july  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility the volatility of the company s common stock was estimated by management based on the historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the risk free interest rate was based on treasury constant maturity rates published by the us federal reserve for periods applicable to the estimated term of the options 
the expected dividend yield was based on the company s current and expected dividend policy 
the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year of was 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with impairment or disposal of long lived assets subsections of fasb asc subtopic  property  plant  and equipment 
overall  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible asset subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if circumstances require a long lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment  the company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
no impairment of long lived assets was recognized for the years ended december  and recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asu amends fasb asc subtopic to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of asu additionally  the new guidance will require entities to disclose more information about their multiple element revenue arrangements 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
management is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of adopting asu on the company s financial position and results of operations 
seasonality of our sales our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations 
this pattern may change  however  as a result of new market opportunities or new product introductions 
inflation inflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are carried out in the prc and we are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in north america and western europe 
accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political  economic and legal environments in the prc  and by the general state of the prc economy 
our results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations  anti inflationary measures  currency conversion and remittance abroad  and rates and methods of taxation  among other things 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short term and long term bank loans 
although the interest rates  which are based on the banks prime rates with respect to our short term loans are fixed for the terms of the loans  the terms are typically three to twelve months for short term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal 
there were no material changes in interest rates for short term bank loans renewed during the fiscal year ended december  a hypothetical increase in the annual interest rates for all of our credit facilities under which we had outstanding borrowings as of december   would decrease net income before provision for income taxes by approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  management monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and majority of expenses are denominated in rmb 
all of our assets are denominated in rmb  except certain cash balances 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb 
if rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income  a component of stockholder s equity 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the value of the rmb against the us dollar and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
since july  the rmb has not been pegged to the us dollar 
although the people s bank of china regularly involved in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or euro in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in rmb exchange rate and lessen involvement in the foreign exchange market 
account balances we maintain balances at financial institutions which  from time to time  may exceed federal deposit insurance corporation insured limits for the banks located in the united states or may exceed hong kong deposit protection board insured limits for the banks located in hong kong 
balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the prc are not covered by insurance 
total cash in banks as of december  and amounted to  and  respectively   and  of which are covered by insurance  respectively 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and we do not believe that we are exposed to any significant risks on our cash in bank accounts 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our sales and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
market for human albumin the company s major product  human albumin ml  ml  ml  ml  ml and ml  accounted for and of the total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the market demands for human albumin cannot be sustained in the future or if the price of human albumin decreases  it would adversely affect our operating results
