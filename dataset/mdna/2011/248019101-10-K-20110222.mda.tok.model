item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview our business is organized into three segments small business services  financial services and direct checks

through these brands  we sell personal and business checks and related products and services directly to consumers using direct response marketing and the internet 
we operate primarily in the united states 
small business services also has operations in canada and portions of europe 
the economic environment continued to have a negative impact on our results of operations during demand continued to fall for many of our small business services products as we believe small business owners reduced their discretionary spending in this difficult economic environment 
additionally  we believe consumer uncertainty related to financial institution consolidations and failures led to reduced check orders from several of our financial institution clients 
financial institution consolidations also impacted our operating results 
in july  we finalized a contract settlement with a large financial institution that previously acquired one of our clients and chose to consolidate its check printing business with another provider 
we had been producing checks for a minority portion of this client s customers 
this business transitioned during the third quarter of and we received contract termination payments of million  which were included as revenue of million in small business services and million in financial services 
revenue from a new contract acquisition which began generating revenue during the third quarter of offset the revenue lost from this contract termination 
in this difficult economic environment  we accelerated many of our cost reduction actions  and we identified additional opportunities to improve our cost structure 
in addition  we believe we took appropriate steps to position ourselves for sustainable growth as the economy recovers  including accelerating our brand awareness and positioning initiatives  investing in technology for new service offerings  enhancing our internet capabilities  improving customer segmentation and adding new small business customers 
we invested in acquisitions that we believe offer higher growth business services  extend our direct to consumer offerings  improve our operating cash flow  and bring analytics driven deposit acquisition marketing programs to our financial institution clients 
we are focused on capitalizing on transformational opportunities available to us and believe that we will be positioned to deliver strong operating margins once the economy recovers 
our net income for  as compared to  benefited from the following continuing initiatives to reduce our cost structure  primarily within manufacturing  sales and marketing  and information technology  asset impairment charges of million in the first quarter of within small business services related to goodwill and an indefinite lived trade name  revenue of million from a contract settlement executed during the third quarter of  recognition of deferred revenue from a financial services contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of  and price increases in small business services and financial services 
these benefits were partially offset by the following reduced volume for our personal check businesses due to the continuing decline in check usage  turmoil in the financial services industry  including bank failures  and continued economic softness  lower volume in small business services due primarily to declines in check and forms usage  as well as changes in our customers buying patterns  we believe  as a result of the continued economic downturn  continued pricing pressure when executing and renewing contracts with financial institution clients  
table of contents pre tax gains of million in the first quarter of from the retirement of long term notes  increased marketing investment in brand positioning and awareness and direct marketing tests  and increases in material costs and delivery rates 
our strategies small business services our focus within small business services is to grow revenue and increase operating margin by continuing to implement the following strategies acquire new customers by leveraging customer referrals that we receive from our financial services segment s financial institution clients and our telecommunications clients  as well as from other marketing initiatives  including internet and direct mail solicitations  expand sales of higher growth business services  including web design  hosting and other web services  fraud protection  payroll  logo design  search engine marketing and business networking  as well as expand sales in areas such as full color  web to print and imaging  increase our share of the amount small businesses spend on the types of products and services in our portfolio through improved customer segmentation and analytics  and continue to optimize our cost and expense structure

in addition to our various service offerings  we continue to offer our knowledge exchangetm series  a suite of resources and events for our financial institution clients focused on topics that most impact financial institution s core strategies 
direct checks our strategies within direct checks are as follows optimize cash flow  maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features  accessories and products  and continue to optimize our cost and expense structure 
in april  we acquired custom direct  inc  a provider of direct to consumer checks  in a cash transaction for million  net of cash acquired 
we are leveraging this acquisition to build a best in class direct to consumer check experience 
we expect the acquisition to contribute to our strategy of optimizing the cash flow generated by this segment 
additionally  we continue to identify opportunities to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas  particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment 
we continue to actively market our products and services through targeted advertising  including a continued focus on e commerce investment 
additionally  we continue to explore avenues to increase sales to existing customers 
for example  we have had success with the ezshieldtm product  a check protection service that provides reimbursement to consumers for losses resulting from forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks 
cost reduction initiatives we have been pursuing cost reduction and business simplification initiatives  including reducing shared services infrastructure costs  streamlining our call center and fulfillment activities  eliminating system and work stream redundancies  reducing advertising costs  and strengthening our ability to quickly develop new products and services and bring them to market 
we have been reducing stock keeping units skus  standardizing products and services and improving the sourcing of third party goods and services 
between and  we closed eight manufacturing facilities  and five customer call centers 
these and other actions since collectively reduced our annual cost structure by approximately million  net of required investments  by the end of approximately million of this amount was newly realized during the baseline for these savings is the annual diluted earnings per share guidance for of to  which we provided in our press release on july  regarding second quarter results 
all three of our business segments benefited from the cost reductions 
approximately of the million target came from reorganizing our sales and marketing functions and another of the target came from our shared services infrastructure organizations of information technology  real estate  finance and human resources 
information technology provided the greatest percentage of the shared services savings through lowering data center costs  improving mainframe and server utilization and reducing the cost of networking and voice communications 
approximately of the million target came from fulfillment  including manufacturing and supply chain 
overall  approximately one third of the savings affected cost of goods sold  with the remaining two thirds impacting selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
we have identified additional opportunities to reduce costs and anticipate that we will realize additional cost reductions of approximately million in  as compared to our results of operations 
these savings will be generated primarily by our sales and marketing and fulfillment organizations 
we estimate that approximately of the savings will impact cost of goods sold  while the remaining will impact sg a expense 

table of contents outlook for we anticipate that consolidated revenue will be between billion and billion for  as compared to billion for at the high end of the range we are expecting only a small improvement in economic conditions 
in small business services  we expect the percentage increase in revenue to be in the low to mid single digits compared to as the benefits of our e commerce investments and growth in business services offerings are expected to be partially offset by declines in core business products 
in financial services  we expect the percentage decrease in revenue to be in the low to mid single digits driven by check order declines of approximately seven to eight percent compared to  given the increases in electronic payments 
we expect the related revenue pressure in financial services will be partially offset by higher revenue per order  a new large customer which we expect will begin contributing volume early in the second quarter of  and continued contributions from non check revenue 
in direct checks  we expect the percentage increase in revenue to be in the mid single digits compared to  driven by a full year of revenue from the custom direct acquisition  partially offset by check usage declines 
we expect that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will be between and  compared to for earnings per share for included charges of per share related to restructuring related costs and a first quarter charge to income tax expense driven by the impact of recent health care legislation 
we expect that continued progress with our cost reduction initiatives will be offset by continued investments in revenue growth opportunities and increases in material and delivery rates 
we estimate that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately  compared to in we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities will be between million and million in  compared to million in  driven by higher earnings on the upper end of our outlook range  continued progress on working capital initiatives and slightly lower contract acquisition payments 
we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million in as we continue to invest in key revenue growth initiatives and order fulfillment and information technology infrastructure 
we believe our credit facility  along with cash generated by operating activities  will be sufficient to support our operations  including capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  required debt service and dividend payments  for the next months 
we are focused on a disciplined approach to capital deployment that focuses on our need to continue investing in initiatives to drive revenue growth  including small to medium sized acquisitions 
we also anticipate that our board of directors will maintain our current dividend level 
however  dividends are approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis  and thus are subject to change 
to the extent we have cash flow in excess of these priorities  our focus during will be on further reducing our debt 
during  we made net payments of million on our credit facility  including borrowings of million in the second quarter of to complete the acquisition of custom direct 
business challenges market risks market for checks and business forms the market for our two largest products  checks and business forms  is very competitive 
these products are mature and their use has been declining 
the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines  direct deposit  and electronic and other bill paying services 
according to a federal reserve study released in december  approximately billion checks were written in according to this study  checks are no longer the largest single non cash payment method in the united states  being eclipsed by the debit card 
checks written account for approximately of all non cash payment transactions  which is a reduction from the federal reserve study released in december when checks accounted for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
the federal reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately per year between and  and we expect this trend to continue 
in addition to the decline in check usage  the use of business forms is also under pressure 
continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  off the shelf business software applications  electronic transaction systems and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre printed business forms products 
financial institution clients because check usage is declining and financial institutions have been consolidating  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
financial institutions seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated from their check programs  despite the decline in check usage 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through supply contracts averaging three to six years in duration 
as we compete to retain and acquire new financial institution business  the resulting pricing pressure  combined with declining check usage in the marketplace  has reduced our revenue and profit margins 
we expect these trends to continue 

table of contents turmoil in the financial services industry since led to increased bank failures and consolidations 
there could be a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations if we were to lose a significant amount of business and or we were unable to recover the value of unamortized contract acquisition costs or accounts receivable 
as of december   unamortized contract acquisition costs totaled million  while liabilities for contract acquisition costs not paid as of december  were million 
the inability to recover amounts paid to one or more of our larger financial institution clients could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the consolidation of financial institutions may also impact our results of operations 
in the past we have occasionally acquired new clients as financial institutions that were not our clients consolidated with our clients 
when two of our financial institution clients consolidate  the increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by the consolidated entity could result in a new contract which is not as favorable to us as those historically negotiated with the clients individually 
however  we may also generate non recurring conversion revenue when obsolete checks have to be replaced after one financial institution merges with or acquires another 
conversely  we have also lost financial institution clients when they consolidated with financial institutions which were not our clients 
if we were to lose a significant amount of business in this manner  it could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in such situations  we have typically collected contract termination payments and we may be able to do so in similar circumstances in the future 
economic conditions general economic conditions negatively impacted our results of operations 
small business confidence and the rate of small business formations impact small business services 
the index of small business optimism published by the national federation of independent business in december was slightly better than december  but had not rebounded to levels 
according to estimates of the small business administration s office of advocacy  the last year in which the number of small businesses increased was consumer spending and employment levels have some impact on our personal check businesses 
slow consumer spending growth  along with only modest private sector growth in employment during  drove some negative impact in our personal check businesses 
we expect that general economic conditions will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations at least through the first half of a continued downturn in general economic conditions could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability 
consolidated results of operations consolidated revenue change in thousands  except per order amounts vs

revenue orders revenue per order the increase in revenue for  as compared to  was primarily due to a revenue contribution of million from the acquisition of custom direct in april discussed under executive overview and revenue of million from a contract settlement executed during the third quarter of in addition  revenue benefited from price increases in financial services and small business services  growth in business services  the recognition of deferred revenue from a financial services contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of  business services revenue from businesses acquired in july  and a favorable currency exchange rate impact of million 
the contract settlement revenue recognized in the third quarter of related to a contract settlement with a large financial institution that previously acquired one of our clients and chose to consolidate its check printing business with another provider

this business transitioned during the third quarter of and we received contract termination payments of million  which were included in revenue in our small business services and financial services segments 
revenue from a new contract acquisition which began generating revenue during the third quarter of offset the revenue lost from this contract termination 
partially offsetting these revenue increases were lower order volume and continued pricing pressure when executing contracts with financial institutions

these increases in revenue per order were partially offset by continued pricing pressure when executing contracts with financial institutions 
the decrease in revenue for  as compared to  was due to lower order volume in each of our segments 
partially offsetting the volume declines were sales of products and services by businesses we acquired in and  as discussed under executive overview  as well as price increases implemented by all three segments 
also  sales of fraud protection services increased in small business services and direct checks during the number of orders decreased for  as compared to  due primarily to general economic conditions which we believe affected our customers buying patterns  the continuing decline in check and forms usage  and turmoil in the financial services industry  including a higher number of bank failures 
partially offsetting these volume declines were sales of products and services by businesses we acquired in and the decline in orders  excluding the acquired businesses  was for  as compared to revenue per order decreased for  as compared to  primarily due to continued pricing pressure within financial services  partially offset by the benefit of price increases 
also impacting revenue per order were sales of products and services by businesses we acquired in and the acquisitions reduced revenue per order by percentage points for  as compared to  primarily because we consider each monthly billing generated for web services to be an order  which results in lower revenue per order

vs 
gross profit gross margin pt 
pt 
we evaluate gross margin when analyzing our consolidated results of operations as we believe it provides important insight into significant profit drivers 
as more than of our revenue at this time is generated from the sale of manufactured and purchased products  we believe the measure of gross margin best demonstrates our manufacturing and distribution performance  as well as the impact of pricing on our profitability 
gross margin is not a complete measure of profitability  as it omits sg a expense 
however  it is a financial measure which we believe is useful in evaluating our results of operations 

table of contents gross margin increased for  as compared to  due primarily to the higher revenue per order discussed earlier  including the million contract settlement which contributed percentage points of the increase in gross margin  as well as manufacturing and delivery efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our cost reduction initiatives 
also contributing to the higher gross margin was a million decrease in restructuring charges and other costs related to our cost reduction initiatives 
further information regarding our restructuring costs can be found under restructuring costs 
partially offsetting these increases in gross margin were higher delivery rates and material costs 
gross margin increased for  as compared to  due primarily to a decrease of million in restructuring charges and other costs related to our cost reduction initiatives 
the lower charges for restructuring and related costs in increased our gross margin for by percentage points  as compared to also contributing to the gross margin increase were manufacturing efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our cost reduction initiatives  as well as price increases

the increase in sg a expense for  as compared to  was driven primarily by expenses from the businesses we acquired in and  as well as marketing investments in our brand awareness and positioning initiatives and direct marketing tests 
these increases were partly offset by various cost reduction initiatives within our shared services organizations  primarily within sales and marketing and information technology  as well as lower acquisition related amortization related to acquisitions completed prior to  and lower performance based compensation and retiree medical expense 
the decrease in sg a expense for  as compared to  was due primarily to various cost reduction initiatives within our shared services organizations  primarily within sales and marketing and information technology

net restructuring charges we recorded restructuring charges and reversals related to the cost reduction initiatives discussed under executive overview 
the charges and reversals for each period relate to accruals for employee severance benefits and other direct costs of our initiatives  including equipment and employee moves  training  travel  and the acceleration of employee share based compensation awards 
additional restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in were included within cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income

asset impairment charges change in thousands vs 
vs 
asset impairment charges as of march   we completed impairment analyses of goodwill and an indefinite lived trade name due to declines in our stock price during the first quarter of coupled with the continuing negative impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
we recorded non cash asset impairment charges in our small business services segment of million related to goodwill and million related to the indefinite lived trade name 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we completed our annual impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to two indefinite lived trade names in our small business services segment resulting from the impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader effects of us market conditions on the fair value of the assets 
we completed additional impairment analyses as of december   based on the continuing impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
as a result  we recorded an additional asset impairment charge of million related to the nebs trade name during the fourth quarter of  bringing the carrying value of this asset to million as of december  the impairment analyses completed as of december   indicated no additional impairment of our other indefinite lived trade name and indicated no impairment of goodwill 
because of the further deterioration in our expected operating results  we determined that the nebs trade name no longer had an indefinite life  and thus  we began amortizing it over its estimated economic life of years on the straight line basis beginning in although the use of checks and forms is declining  revenues generated from our small business services strategies have  and we expect will continue to  offset a portion of the decline in revenues and cash flows generated from the sale of checks and forms 
as such  we believe that the sale of checks and forms  as well as the sale of additional products and services under the nebs trade name  will generate sufficient cash flows to support our estimated year economic life for this intangible asset 
in addition to the impairment charges related to the indefinite lived trade names  we also recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of related to an amortizable trade name 
this impairment resulted from a change in our branding strategy

additionally  due to the early retirement of long term notes during the first quarter of  we were required to accelerate the recognition of a portion of a previously deferred derivative loss 
this accelerated recognition resulted in additional interest expense of million in the decrease in interest expense for  as compared to  was due to our lower average debt level in  as well as our lower weighted average interest rate

income tax provision effective tax rate pt 
pt 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge in  a portion of which was non deductible  and which increased our effective tax rate percentage points 
in addition  our state effective tax rate decreased in and our qualified production activity deduction increased 
partially offsetting these decreases in our effective tax rate was the impact of other discrete items and lower tax credits in for research and development 
discrete items in  excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  lowered our effective tax rate percentage points and related primarily to receivables for amendments to prior year tax returns of million 
discrete income tax expense for increased our effective tax rate by points 
the discrete items in consisted primarily of a million charge resulting from the health care and education reconciliation act of  which was signed into law in march  and requires that certain tax deductions after be reduced by the amount of the medicare part d subsidy payments 
prior to this law change  the subsidy was to be disregarded in all future years when computing tax deductions 
this resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax asset associated with our postretirement benefit plan  although we anticipate recovery of this amount in and as we fund the plan 
partially offsetting the impact of this unfavorable discrete item were discrete credits to income tax expense related to adjustments to accruals for uncertain tax positions 
we expect that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately 
the increase in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was largely due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge in  a portion of which was non deductible 
offsetting this increase in our effective tax rate were favorable discrete adjustments in which lowered our effective tax rate percentage points 
the discrete adjustments related primarily to receivables for amendments to prior year tax returns of million 
our effective tax rate included favorable discrete adjustments which lowered our effective tax rate percentage points 
the discrete adjustments in related primarily to receivables for amendments to prior year tax returns of million and the settlement of million due to us under a tax sharing agreement related to the spin off of our efunds business in  partially offset by accruals for unrecognized tax benefits

during a review of our cost structure  we made the decision to expand our use of the digital printing process

both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
these payments impact the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made rather than providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements or to guarantee the performance of third parties 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as product or service defects  including breach of security  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of terms of the contract 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks  including  for example  unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that any likely liability under these indemnities would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  annual results of operations or annual cash flows

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
our accounting policies are discussed under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
application of critical accounting policies we consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions could be material to our financial condition or results of operations

goodwill and our indefinite lived trade name are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
we completed events driven impairment analyses of goodwill and our indefinite lived trade name during the first quarter of due to declines in our stock price coupled with the continuing negative impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results  and during the fourth quarter of we completed events driven impairment analyses of goodwill and our indefinite lived trade names due to the continuing impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
in addition to the required impairment analyses  we regularly evaluate the remaining useful life of our indefinite lived trade name to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we determine that this asset has a finite useful life  we would test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset s remaining carrying value over its estimated remaining useful life 
the estimate of fair value for the indefinite lived trade name is based on a relief from royalty method  which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name 
an assumed royalty rate is applied to forecasted revenue and the resulting cash flows are discounted 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
the annual impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived trade name was million  compared to its carrying value of million 
in this analysis  we assumed a discount rate of and a royalty rate of 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million and a one half percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million 
during the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million in our small business services segment related to the indefinite lived trade name  and during  we recorded impairment charges of million in our small business services segment related to two indefinite lived trade names 
in addition to the impairment of indefinite lived trade names  we also recorded an impairment charge of million during related to an amortizable trade name due to a change in our branding strategy 
while completing the impairment analyses during the fourth quarter of  we determined that because of the further deterioration in our expected operating results  one of the indefinite lived trade names  the nebs trade name  no longer had an indefinite life 
as such  we analyzed this trade name for impairment and began amortizing it over its estimated economic life of years on the straight line basis 
although the use of checks and forms is declining  revenues generated from our small business services strategies have  and we expect will continue to  offset a portion of the decline in revenue and cash flows generated from the sale of checks and forms 
as such  we believe that the sale of checks and forms  as well as the sale of additional products and services under the nebs trade name  will generate sufficient cash flows to support our estimated year economic life for this intangible asset 
this asset is no longer subject to annual impairment testing  but will be tested for impairment  as necessary  in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles  as 
table of contents outlined under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
a two step approach is used in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
first  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of its net assets 
in calculating fair value  we use the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant 
using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques  we project revenue for the next five years 
we apply our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows 
a terminal value is then applied to the projected cash flow stream 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the discount rate used is the value weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units we are required to estimate a number of factors  including projected future operating results  terminal growth rates  economic conditions  anticipated future cash flows  the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items 
for reasonableness  the summation of our reporting units fair values is compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization plus an appropriate control premium 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis requires us to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill  we measure the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the annual impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of indicated that the calculated fair values of our reporting units net assets exceeded the carrying values of their net assets by amounts between million and million  or by amounts between and above the carrying values of their net assets 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units by approximately 
of the other key assumptions that impact estimated fair value  most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate 
as of july   our discount rate could have increased more than eight percentage points before any of our reporting units would have failed step one of the goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the events driven impairment analysis completed during the first quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our small business services segment related to one of our reporting units 
if our stock price declines in the future for a sustained period or if we are required to significantly reduce our forecasted operating results because of a continuing downturn in economic conditions  it may be indicative of a further decline in our fair value and could require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and or our indefinite lived trade name 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows and revenues over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in interim reporting periods  we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based on the facts available at the time 
changes in the mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact our estimated effective tax rate in interim periods 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the interim period during which the unusual or one time item occurred 
the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense  net of the expected tax benefit  in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in 
table of contents evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we had net deferred tax liabilities of million as of december   including valuation allowances of million 
as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities of million  including valuation allowances of million 
the valuation allowances relate primarily to canadian operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize 
we are subject to tax audits in numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
tax audits are often complex and can require several years to complete 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to challenges from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions  or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we recognize the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements when they are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would positively affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   we had accrued million of interest and penalties  excluding the tax benefit of deductible interest 
the statute of limitations for federal tax assessments for and prior years has closed  with the exception of our federal income tax returns through have been audited by the irs and our federal income tax returns for  and remain subject to irs examination 
in general  income tax returns for the years through remain subject to examination by major state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution would result in reduced income tax expense 
changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the last three years can be found under the caption note income tax provision of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
within the next months  it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change in the range of a decrease of million to an increase of million as we attempt to settle certain federal and state matters or as federal and state statutes of limitations expire 
we are not able to predict what  if any  impact these changes may have on our effective tax rate or cash flows 
during  we recorded income tax expense of million to reduce our deferred tax asset related to our postretirement benefit plan 
this expense resulted from the health care and education reconciliation act of  which was signed into law in march  and requires that certain tax deductions after be reduced by the amount of the medicare part d subsidy payments 
prior to this law change  the subsidy was to be disregarded in all future years when computing tax deductions 
we anticipate we will recover this amount in and as we fund our postretirement benefit plan 
we reduced our income tax provision million in and million in for amendments to prior year tax returns claiming refunds primarily associated with federal and state tax credits and the funding of medical costs through our veba trust  as well as the related interest 
also during  we reduced our income tax provision million for the settlement of amounts due to us under a tax sharing agreement related to the spin off of our efunds business in postretirement benefit plan detailed information regarding our postretirement benefit plan  including a description of the plan  its related future cash flows  plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plan  can be found under the caption note pension and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
our net postretirement benefit expense was million for  million for and million for our business segments record postretirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold and sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our postretirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
the effects of changes to our assumptions are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into earnings over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our postretirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods are impacted 

table of contents discount rate the discount rate is used to reflect the time value of money 
it is the assumed rate at which future postretirement benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the hewitt top quartile and the citigroup pension discount yield curves to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
the discount rate established at year end for purposes of calculating our benefit obligation is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit expense for the following year 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on our annual postretirement benefit expense  and would increase or decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
in determining this rate  we utilize our historical returns and then adjust these returns for estimated inflation 
our inflation assumption is primarily based on historical inflation data 
in measuring net postretirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
expected health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be 
our ultimate health care inflation rate was assumed to be in and beyond 
a one percentage point change in the health care inflation rate for each year would have the following effects in thousands one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on benefit obligation average remaining life expectancy of plan participants in determining the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  our actuaries use a mortality table which includes estimated death rates for each age 
we use the rp combined healthy participant table projected to the measurement date with scale aa in determining this assumption 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
the gain or loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated balance sheet within accumulated comprehensive loss and is amortized into postretirement benefit expense 
effective april   we amended our postretirement benefit plan to decrease the minimum age for eligibility to receive the maximum available benefits from age to age and to decrease the service requirement for maximum retiree cost sharing from years to years 
prior to the april  plan amendment and re measurement  unrecognized actuarial gains and losses were being amortized over the average remaining service period of plan participants  which was years as of december  because the plan amendment increased the number of participants currently eligible to receive the maximum available benefits  almost all of the plan participants were classified as inactive subsequent to the plan amendment 
as such  actuarial gains and losses are required to be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants  which was years as of april  this change resulted in a million decrease in postretirement benefit expense for  as compared to the expense we had expected for prior to the plan amendments 
the fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets is subject to various risks  including credit  interest and overall market volatility risks 
during  the equity markets experienced a significant decline in value 
as such  the fair value of our plan assets decreased significantly during the year  resulting in a million increase in the unfunded status of our plan as compared to the end of the previous year 
this affected the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and also contributed to an increase in postretirement benefit expense of million in  as compared to the fair value of our plan assets recovered during and  increasing million during and million during if the equity and bond markets decline in future periods  the funded status of our plan could again be materially affected 
this could result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future  as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund the benefits payable under the plan  although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable 
we did not use plan assets to make benefit payments during or rather  we used cash provided by operating activities to make these payments 
restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as on some occasions employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the 
table of contents extent our assumptions and estimates differ from our actual costs  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
we reversed previously recorded restructuring accruals of million in  million in and million in  primarily as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during  we used our credit facilities to fund working capital  acquisitions and debt service requirements 
the nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of december   our total debt was comprised of the following in thousands carrying amount fair value weighted average interest rate long term notes maturing december long term notes maturing october long term notes maturing june amounts drawn on credit facility total debt based on quoted market prices as of december  for identical liabilities when traded as assets  with the exception of amounts drawn on our credit facility for which fair value equals carrying value due to its short term nature 
we may  from time to time  retire outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements and other potential uses of cash  including acquisitions or share repurchases 
in september  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our ten year bonds due in we entered into these swaps  which we designated as fair value hedges  to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt  where we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the related long term debt are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
when the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the hedged debt are not equal ie  hedge ineffectiveness  the difference in the changes in fair value affects the reported amount of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
hedge ineffectiveness was not significant for the fair value of the interest rate swaps as of december  was million and is included in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on the outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio  a one percentage point change in interest rates would have resulted in a million change in interest expense for we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
investments in  loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  as well as the operations of these businesses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
we expect the effect of exchange rate changes to have a minimal impact on our results of operations and cash flows  as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business
