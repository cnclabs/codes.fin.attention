the following discussion includes references to our performance measures operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders  that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and  consistent with gaap accounting guidance for segment reporting  is our measure of segment performance 
operating earnings is also a measure by which our senior management s and many other employees performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans 
operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses  net of income tax 
operating earnings available to common shareholders  which is used to evaluate the performance of banking  corporate other  as well as metlife  is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends 
operating revenues is defined as gaap revenues i less net investment gains losses and net derivative gains losses  ii less amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains losses and net derivative gains losses  iii plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  iv plus income from discontinued real estate operations  v less net investment income related to contractholder directed unit linked investments  and vi plus  for operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting  the aforementioned adjustments  those identified in the definition of operating expenses and changes in the fair value of hedges of operating joint venture liabilities  all net of income tax 
operating expenses is defined as gaap expenses i less changes in policyholder benefits associated with asset value fluctuations related to experience rated contractholder liabilities and certain inflation indexed liabilities  ii less costs related to business combinations since january  and noncontrolling interests  iii less amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac and value of business acquired voba and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains losses and net derivative gains losses  iv less interest credited to policyholder account balances pabs related to contractholder directed unit linked investments  and v plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of pabs but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
in addition  operating revenues and operating expenses do not reflect the consolidation of certain securitization entities that are variable interest entities vies as required under gaap 
we believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our businesses 
operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax 
reconciliations of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders to gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  the most directly comparable gaap measure  are included in results of operations 
in this discussion  we sometimes refer to sales activity for various products 
these sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under gaap  but are used as relevant measures of business activity

on the acquisition date  the holding company completed the acquisition of american life from alico holdings llc alico holdings  a subsidiary of american international group  inc aig  and delam from aig  the acquisition for a total purchase price of billion 
the business acquired in the acquisition provides consumers and businesses with life insurance  accident and health insurance  retirement and wealth management solutions 
this transaction delivers on our global growth strategies  adding significant scale and reach to metlife s international footprint  furthering our diversification in geographic mix and product offerings  as well as increasing our distribution strength 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as the us and global financial markets continue to recover  we have experienced a significant improvement in net investment income and favorable changes in net investment and net derivative gains losses 
we also continue to experience an increase in market share and sales in some of our businesses  in part  from a flight to quality in the industry 
these positive factors were somewhat dampened by the negative impact of general economic conditions  including high levels of unemployment  on the demand for certain of our products 
years ended december  in millions income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax less net investment gains losses less net derivative gains losses less adjustments to continuing operations less provision for income tax expense benefit operating earnings less preferred stock dividends operating earnings available to common shareholders see definitions of operating revenues and operating expenses for the components of such adjustments 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts discussed below are net of income tax 
during the year ended december   metlife s income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax increased billion to a gain of billion from a loss of billion in  of which million in losses is from the inclusion of alico results for one month in and the impact of financing costs for the acquisition 
the change was predominantly due to a billion favorable change in net derivative gains losses  before income tax  and a billion favorable change in net investment gains losses  before income tax 
offsetting these favorable variances were unfavorable changes in adjustments related to continuing operations of billion  before income tax  and billion of income tax  resulting in a total favorable variance of billion 
in addition  operating earnings available to common shareholders increased billion to billion in the current year from billion in the prior year 
the favorable change in net derivative gains losses of billion was primarily driven by net gains on freestanding derivatives in the current year compared to net losses in the prior year  partially offset by an unfavorable change in embedded derivatives from gains in the prior year to losses in the current year 
the favorable change in freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to market factors  including falling long term and mid term interest rates  a stronger recovery in equity markets in the prior year than the current year  equity volatility  which decreased more in the prior year as compared to the current year  a strengthening us dollar and widening corporate credit spreads in the financial services sector 
the favorable change in net investment gains losses of 
table of contents billion was primarily driven by a decrease in impairments and a decrease in the provision for credit losses on mortgage loans 
these favorable changes in net derivative and net investment gains losses were partially offset by an unfavorable change of million in related adjustments 
the improvement in the financial markets  which began in the second quarter of and continued into  was a key driver of the billion increase in operating earnings available to common shareholders 
such market improvement was most evident in higher net investment income and policy fees  as well as a decrease in variable annuity guarantee benefit costs 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of dac  voba and deferred sales inducements dsi as a result of an increase in average separate account balances and higher current year gross margins in the closed block driven by increased investment yields and the impact of dividend scale reductions 
the period also includes one month of alico results  contributing million to the increase in operating earnings 
the favorable impact of a reduction in discretionary spending associated with our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative was more than offset by an increase in other expenses related to our international business 
this increase primarily stemmed from the impact of a benefit recorded in the prior year related to the pesification in argentina  as well as current year business growth in the segment 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts discussed below are net of income tax 
during the year ended december   metlife s income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  decreased billion to a loss of billion from income of billion in the comparable period 
the year over year change is predominantly due to an billion unfavorable change in net derivative gains losses  before income tax  to losses of billion in from gains of billion in in addition  there was an million unfavorable change in net investment gains losses  before income tax 
offsetting these variances were favorable changes in adjustments related to continuing operations of million  before income tax  and billion of income tax  resulting in a total unfavorable variance of billion 
in addition  operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased by million to billion in from billion in the unfavorable change in net derivative gains losses of billion was primarily driven by losses on freestanding derivatives  partially offset by gains on embedded derivatives  most of which were associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees  and lower losses on fixed maturity securities 
the unfavorable change in net investment gains losses of million was primarily driven by an increase in impairments 
these unfavorable changes in gains losses were partially offset by a favorable change of million in related adjustments 
the positive impact of business growth and favorable mortality in several of our businesses was more than offset by a decline in net investment income  resulting in a decrease in operating earnings of million 
the decrease in net investment income caused significant declines in the operating earnings of many of our businesses  especially the interest spread businesses 
also contributing to the decline in operating earnings was an increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit costs and a charge related to our closed block of business  a specific group of participating life policies that were segregated in connection with the demutualization of metropolitan life insurance company mlic 
the favorable impact of our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative  was more than offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs  driving the increase in other expenses 
the declines in operating earnings were partially offset by a change in amortization related to dac  dsi and unearned revenue 
consolidated company outlook as a result of the acquisition  operations outside the us are expected to contribute approximately of the premiums  fees and other revenues and approximately of metlife s operating earnings in 
table of contents in  general economic conditions improved and interest rates remained low throughout the year 
in  we expect a significant improvement in the operating earnings of the company  driven primarily by the following premiums  fees and other revenues growth in of approximately  of which is directly attributable to the acquisition 
the remaining increase is driven by increases in our non us businesses from continuing organic growth throughout our various geographic regions  higher fees earned on separate accounts  as the equity markets continue to improve  thereby increasing the value of those separate accounts 
in addition  net flows of variable annuities are expected to continue to be strong in  which also increases the account values upon which these fees are earned  increased sales in the pension closeout business  both in the us and the united kingdom us  as we expect the demand for these products to return to a more normal level in focus on disciplined underwriting 
we see no significant changes to the underlying trends that drive underwriting results and anticipate solid results in focus on expense management 
we continue to focus on expense control throughout the company  specifically managing the costs associated with the integration of alico 
we also expect to begin realizing cost synergies later in returns on investment portfolio 
although the market environment remains challenging  we expect the returns on our investment portfolio in  with respect to both income and realized gains and losses  will be in line with the results achieved in more difficult to predict is the impact of potential changes in fair value of freestanding and embedded derivatives as even relatively small movements in market variables  including interest rates  equity levels and volatility  can have a large impact on the fair value of derivatives and net derivative gains losses 
additionally  changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within certain insurance liabilities may have a material impact on net derivative gains losses related to the inclusion of an adjustment for nonperformance risk 
industry trends despite improvement in general economic conditions in  we continue to be impacted by the unstable global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry 
financial and economic environment 
our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy  generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
the global economy and markets are now recovering from a period of significant stress that began in the second half of and substantially increased through the first quarter of this disruption adversely affected the financial services industry  in particular 
the us economy entered a recession in late this recession ended in mid  but the recovery from the recession has been below historic averages and the unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time 
in addition  inflation has fallen over the last several years and is expected to remain at low levels for some time 
some economists believe that some level of disinflation and deflation risk remains in the economy 
throughout and continuing in  congress  the federal reserve bank of new york  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the us treasury and other agencies of the federal government took a number of increasingly aggressive actions in addition to continuing a series of interest rate reductions that began in the second half of intended to provide liquidity to financial institutions and markets  to avert a loss of investor confidence in particular troubled institutions  to prevent or contain the spread of the financial crisis and to spur economic growth 
most of these programs have run their course or have been discontinued 
the monetary policy by the federal reserve board and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank  which was signed by president obama in july  are more likely to be relevant to metlife  inc and will significantly change financial regulation in the us see regulatory changes 
in addition  the oversight body of the basel committee on banking supervision announced in december increased capital and liquidity requirements commonly referred 
table of contents to as basel iii for bank holding companies  such as metlife  inc assuming these requirements are endorsed and adopted by the us  they are to be phased in beginning january  it is possible that even more stringent capital and liquidity requirements could be imposed under dodd frank and basel iii 
it is not certain what effect the enactment of dodd frank or basel iii will have on the financial markets  the availability of credit  asset prices and metlife s operations 
we cannot predict whether the funds made available by the us federal government and its agencies will be enough to continue stabilizing or to further revive the financial markets or  if additional amounts are necessary  whether congress will be willing to make the necessary appropriations  what the public s sentiment would be towards any such appropriations  or what additional requirements or conditions might be imposed on the use of any such additional funds 
the imposition of additional regulation on large financial institutions may have  over time  the effect of supporting some aspects of the financial services industry more than others 
this could adversely affect our competitive position 
although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated  not all such markets are functioning normally  and some remain reliant upon government intervention and liquidity 
the global recession and disruption of the financial markets has also led to concerns over capital markets access and the solvency of certain european union member states  including portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain 
in response  on may   the european union  the european central bank and the international monetary fund announced a rescue package of up to billion  or approximately trillion  for european nations in the eurozone 
this rescue package is intended to stabilize these economies 
the japanese economy  to which we face increased exposure as a result of the acquisition  continues to experience low nominal growth  a deflationary environment  and weak consumer spending 
recent global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in the financial services industry  including metlife 
such global economic conditions  as well as the global financial markets  continue to impact our net investment income  our net investment and net derivative gains losses  and the demand for and the cost and profitability of certain of our products  including variable annuities and guarantee benefits 
see results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
competitive pressures 
the life insurance industry remains highly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development  technology and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition 
sufficient scale  financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 
we believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began in the second half of  its impact on the capital position of many competitors  and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have highlighted financial strength as a significant differentiator from the perspective of customers and certain distributors 
in addition  the financial market turbulence and the economic recession have led many companies in our industry to re examine the pricing and features of the products they offer and may lead to consolidation in the life insurance industry 
regulatory changes 
the us life insurance industry is regulated at the state level  with some products and services also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products  including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products 
the regulation of the financial services industry in the us and internationally has received renewed scrutiny as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets in and significant regulatory reforms have been proposed and these or other reforms could be implemented 
see business us regulation and business international regulation 
we cannot predict whether any such reforms will be adopted  the form they will take or their effect upon us 
we also cannot predict how the various government responses to the recent financial and economic difficulties will affect the financial services and insurance industries or the standing of particular companies  including us  within those industries 
see business governmental 
table of contents responses to extraordinary market conditions  risk factors our insurance  brokerage and banking businesses are heavily regulated  and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth and risk factors changes in us federal and state securities laws and regulations  and state insurance regulations regarding suitability of annuity product sales  may affect our operations and our profitability 
until various studies are completed and final regulations are promulgated pursuant to dodd frank  the full impact of dodd frank on the investments  investment activities and insurance and annuity products of the company remain unclear 
see risk factors various aspects of dodd frank could impact our business operations  capital requirements and profitability and limit our growth 
under dodd frank  as a large  interconnected bank holding company with assets of billion or more  or possibly as an otherwise systemically important financial company  metlife  inc will be subject to enhanced prudential standards imposed on systemically significant financial companies 
enhanced standards will be applied to tier and total risk based capital rbc  liquidity  leverage unless another  similar standard is appropriate for the company  resolution plan and credit exposure reporting  concentration limits  and risk management 
the so called volcker rule provisions of dodd frank restrict the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions such as metlife bank to engage in proprietary trading or sponsor or invest in hedge funds or private equity funds 
see risk factors various aspects of dodd frank could impact our business operations  capital requirements and profitability and limit our growth 
mortgage and foreclosure related exposures 
in metlife bank acquired certain assets to enter the forward and reverse residential mortgage origination and servicing business  including rights to service residential mortgage loans 
at various times since then  including most recently in the third quarter of  metlife bank has acquired additional residential mortgage loan servicing rights 
as an originator and servicer of mortgage loans  which are usually sold to an investor shortly after origination  metlife bank has obligations to repurchase loans upon demand by the investor due to i a determination that material representations made in connection with the sale of the loans relating  for example  to the underwriting and origination of the loans are incorrect or ii defects in servicing of the loan 
metlife bank is indemnified by the sellers of the acquired assets  for various periods depending on the transaction and the nature of the claim  for origination and servicing deficiencies that occurred prior to metlife bank s acquisition  including indemnification for any repurchase claims made from investors who purchased mortgage loans from the sellers 
substantially all mortgage servicing rights msrs that were acquired by metlife bank relate to loans sold to federal national mortgage association fnma or federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
since the acquisitions  metlife bank has originated and sold mortgages primarily to fnma  fhlmc and government national mortgage association gnma collectively  the agency investors and  to a limited extent  a small number of private investors 
currently of metlife bank s billion servicing portfolio is comprised of products sold to agency investors 
other than repurchase obligations which are subject to indemnification by sellers of acquired assets as described above  metlife bank s exposure to repurchase obligations and losses related to origination deficiencies is limited to the approximately billion of loans originated by metlife bank all of which have been originated since august and to servicing deficiencies after the date of acquisition  and management is satisfied that adequate provision has been made in the company s consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable repurchase obligations and losses 
in light of recent events concerning foreclosure proceedings within the industry  metlife bank has undertaken a close review of its procedures 
metlife bank verifies the accuracy of borrower information included in affidavits filed in foreclosure proceedings 
we do not believe that metlife bank has material exposure to potential losses arising from challenges to its foreclosure procedures 
like other mortgage servicers  metlife bank has been the subject of recent inquiries and investigations from state attorneys general and banking regulators 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i the estimated fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values  ii investment impairments  
table of contents iii the recognition of income on certain investment entities and the application of the consolidation rules to certain investments  iv the estimated fair value of and accounting for freestanding derivatives and the existence and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  v the capitalization and amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba  vi the measurement of goodwill and related impairment  if any  vii the liability for future policyholder benefits and the accounting for reinsurance contracts  viii accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets  ix accounting for employee benefit plans  and x the liability for litigation and regulatory matters 
the application of purchase accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to aforementioned critical accounting estimates 
in applying the company s accounting policies  we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
fair value the company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in many cases  the exit price and the transaction or entry price will be the same at initial recognition 
however  in certain cases  the transaction price may not represent fair value 
the fair value of a liability is based on the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability to a third party with the same credit standing 
it requires that fair value be a market based measurement in which the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant 
when quoted prices are not used to determine fair value of an asset  the company considers three broad valuation techniques i the market approach  ii the income approach  and iii the cost approach 
the company determines the most appropriate valuation technique to use  given what is being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs 
the company prioritizes the inputs to fair valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available 
the company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three level hierarchy  based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
an asset or liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input to its valuation 
the input levels are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
the company defines active markets based on average trading volume for equity securities 
the size of the bid ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed maturity securities 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in level  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other significant inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as 
table of contents instruments for which the determination of estimated fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
prior to january   the measurement and disclosures of fair value based on exit price excluded certain items such as nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at estimated fair value in a business combination  reporting units measured at estimated fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test and indefinite lived intangible assets measured at estimated fair value for impairment assessment 
in addition  the company elected the fair value option fvo for certain of its financial instruments to better match measurement of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations 
estimated fair value of investments the company s investments in fixed maturity and equity securities  investments in trading and other securities  certain short term investments  most mortgage loans held for sale  and msrs are reported at their estimated fair value 
in determining the estimated fair value of these investments  various methodologies  assumptions and inputs are utilized  as described further below 
when available  the estimated fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable 
generally  these are the most liquid of the company s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management judgment 
when quoted prices in active markets are not available  the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or other similar techniques 
the inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated fair values are based on available market information and management s judgments about financial instruments 
the significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
when observable inputs are not available  the market standard valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value of certain types of securities that trade infrequently  and therefore have little or no price transparency  rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
these unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or estimation  and cannot be supported by reference to market activity 
even though unobservable  these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities 
the estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is determined based on observable pricing of residential mortgage loans held for sale with similar characteristics  or observable pricing for securities backed by similar types of loans  adjusted to convert the securities prices to loan prices 
generally  quoted market prices are not available 
when observable pricing for similar loans or securities that are backed by similar loans are not available  the estimated fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are determined using independent broker quotations  which is intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from third parties 
certain other mortgage loans have also been designated as held for sale which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an individual loan basis 
for these loans  estimated fair value is determined using independent broker quotations or  when the loan is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral estimated using internal models 

table of contents msrs  which are recorded in other invested assets  are measured at estimated fair value and are either acquired or are generated from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans where the servicing rights are retained by the company 
the estimated fair value of msrs is principally determined through the use of internal discounted cash flow models which utilize various assumptions 
valuation inputs and assumptions include generally observable items such as type and age of loan  loan interest rates  current market interest rates  and certain unobservable inputs  including assumptions regarding estimates of discount rates  loan prepayments and servicing costs  all of which are sensitive to changing markets conditions 
the use of different valuation assumptions and inputs  as well as assumptions relating to the collection of expected cash flows  may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of msrs 
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity 
the company s ability to sell securities  or the price ultimately realized for these securities  depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities 
investment impairments one of the significant estimates related to available for sale securities is the evaluation of investments for impairments 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and or age of the gross unrealized loss  as described more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments and the company s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected 
in contrast  for certain equity securities  greater weight and consideration are given by the company to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover 
additionally  we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi with respect to fixed maturity securities  whether the company has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular security before recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below cost or amortized cost  vii with respect to equity securities  whether the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost  viii unfavorable changes in projected cash flows on mortgage backed and asset backed securities abs  and ix other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 

table of contents the cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for the credit loss component of other than temporary impairment otti in the period in which the determination is made 
when an otti of a fixed maturity security has occurred  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below amortized cost 
if the fixed maturity security meets either of these two criteria  the otti recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost and its estimated fair value at the impairment measurement date 
for otti of fixed maturity securities that do not meet either of these two criteria  the net amount recognized in earnings is equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected from this security credit loss 
if the estimated fair value is less than the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected  this portion of otti related to other than credit factors noncredit loss is recorded as other comprehensive income loss 
for equity securities  the carrying value of the equity security is impaired to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
the company does not make any adjustments for subsequent recoveries in value 
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
recognition of income on certain investment entities the recognition of income on certain investments eg loan backed securities  including mortgage backed and abs  certain structured investment transactions  trading and other securities is dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned 
application of the consolidation rules to certain investments the company has invested in certain structured transactions that are vies 
these structured transactions include reinsurance trusts  asset backed securitizations  hybrid securities  real estate joint ventures  other limited partnership interests and limited liability companies 
the company is required to consolidate those vies for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
the accounting rules for the determination of when an entity is a vie and when to consolidate a vie are complex 
the determination of the vie s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the contractual and implied rights and obligations associated with each party s relationship with or involvement in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party involved in the entity 
the company generally uses a qualitative approach to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary 
for most vies  the entity that has both the ability to direct the most significant activities of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could be significant to the vie is considered the primary beneficiary 
however  for vies that are investment companies or apply measurement principles consistent with those utilized by investment companies  the primary beneficiary is based on a risks and rewards model and is defined as the entity that will absorb a majority of a vie s expected losses  receive a majority of a vie s expected residual returns if no single entity absorbs a majority of expected losses  or both 
the company reassesses its involvement with vies on a quarterly basis 
the use of different methodologies  assumptions and inputs in the determination of the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions including swaps  forwards  futures and option contracts to manage various risks relating to its ongoing business operations 
to a lesser extent  the company uses credit derivatives  such as credit default swaps  to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market 

table of contents the estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices for exchange traded derivatives and interest forwards to sell certain to be announced securities or through the use of pricing models for over the counter otc derivatives 
the determination of estimated fair value  when quoted market values are not available  is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to be consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments 
derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  default risk including the counterparties to the contract  volatility  liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on significant inputs into the otc derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment 
the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting guidance continue to evolve in practice 
judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment under such accounting guidance 
if it was determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
differences in judgment as to the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company from that previously reported 
assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income 
embedded derivatives the company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits 
these include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb  guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  and certain guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib 
gmwb  gmab and certain gmib are embedded derivatives  which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains losses 
the estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees 
the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
a risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk free rates 
the valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for the company s nonperformance risk and risk margins for non capital market inputs 
the nonperformance risk adjustment is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for the holding company s debt  including related credit default swaps 
these observable spreads are then adjusted  as necessary  to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to the holding company 
risk margins are established to capture the non capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization  premium persistency  partial withdrawal and surrenders 
the establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment 
the accounting for embedded derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
if interpretations change  there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income 
these guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets 
market conditions including  but not limited to  changes in interest rates  equity indices  market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the company s nonperformance risk  variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior  mortality and risk margins related to non capital market inputs may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income 

table of contents the company ceded the risk associated with certain of the gmib and gmab described in the preceding paragraphs 
the value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the company 
as part of its regular review of critical accounting estimates  the company periodically assesses inputs for estimating nonperformance risk in fair value measurements 
during the second quarter of  the company completed a study that aggregated and evaluated data  including historical recovery rates of insurance companies as well as policyholder behavior observed over the past two years as the recent financial crisis evolved 
as a result  at the end of the second quarter of  the company refined the manner in which its insurance subsidiaries incorporate expected recovery rates into the nonperformance risk adjustment for purposes of estimating the fair value of investment type contracts and embedded derivatives within insurance contracts 
the refinement impacted the company s income from continuing operations  net of income tax  with no effect on operating earnings 
as described above  the valuation of variable annuity guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an adjustment for the company s nonperformance risk  which is subject to variability 
the table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on the company s consolidated balance sheet  excluding the effect of income tax 
changes in the carrying values of pabs would be reported in net investment gains losses and changes in the carrying value of dac and voba would be reported in other expenses 
however  these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables  such as equity price levels and market volatility  that can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values 
therefore  the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below 
in determining the ranges  the company has considered current market conditions as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term 
the ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions experienced during the and economic crisis as the company does not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future 
carrying value at december  dac and pabs voba in millions increase in the company s credit spread as reported decrease in the company s credit spread the estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is determined using market standard swap valuation models and observable market inputs  including an adjustment for the company s nonperformance risk that takes into consideration publicly available information relating to the company s debt  as well as its claims paying ability 
changes in equity and bond indices  interest rates and the company s credit standing may result in significant fluctuations in estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income 
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
costs that vary with and relate to the production of new business are deferred as dac 
such costs consist principally of commissions and agency and policy issuance expenses 
voba is an intangible asset that represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance  annuity  and investment type contracts in force at the acquisition date 
the estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially determined projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns  nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
dac and voba are aggregated in the consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes 

table of contents note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s accounting policy relating to dac and voba amortization for various types of contracts 
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in force account balances on such contracts each reporting period which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of dac and voba 
the company s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short term market fluctuations  but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected 
the company monitors these events and only changes the assumption when its long term expectation changes 
the effect of an increase decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in the dac and voba amortization of approximately million with an offset to the company s unearned revenue liability of approximately million for this factor 
the company also periodically reviews other long term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits 
these include investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses to administer business 
we annually update assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed 
if the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase  dac and voba amortization will decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease 
the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of dac and voba were due to revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  in force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on contracts included within the insurance products and retirement products segments 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a rollforward of dac and voba for the company for each of the years ended december   and  as well as a breakdown of dac and voba by segment and reporting unit at december  and at december   and  dac and voba for the company was billion  billion and million  respectively 
the dac and voba balance increased significantly as a result of the acquisition  which contributed billion to the balance at december  approximately  of the company s dac and voba was associated with the insurance products and retirement products segments at december  at december   and  dac and voba for these segments was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
amortization of dac and voba associated with the variable and universal life and the annuities contracts within the insurance products and retirement products segments is significantly impacted by movements in equity markets 
the following chart illustrates the effect on dac and voba within the company s us business of changing each of the respective assumptions  as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended december   and increases decreases in dac and voba balances  as presented below  resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in amortization

table of contents the following represents significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits increased as a result of a decrease in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities  resulting in an increase of dac and voba amortization of million  excluding the impact from the company s nonperformance risk and risk margins  which are described below 
this increase in actual gross profits was partially offset by freestanding derivative losses associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations  which resulted in a decrease in dac and voba amortization of million 
the narrowing of the company s nonperformance risk adjustment increased the valuation of guarantee liabilities  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
in addition  higher risk margins which increased the guarantee liability valuations  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses  which increased dac amortization by million  was primarily attributable to current period investment activities 
included in policyholder dividends and other was an increase in dac and voba amortization of million as a result of changes to long term assumptions 
in addition  amortization increased by million as a result of favorable gross margin variances 
the remainder of the increase was due to various immaterial items 
the following represents significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in actual gross profits decreased as a result of increased investment losses from the portfolios associated with the hedging of guaranteed insurance obligations on variable annuities  resulting in a decrease of dac and voba amortization of million

the remainder of the decrease was due to various immaterial items 
the following represents significant items contributing to the changes in dac and voba amortization in the decrease in equity markets during the year significantly lowered separate account balances which led to a significant reduction in expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in an increase of million in dac and voba amortization 

table of contents changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities resulting in a reduction of dac and voba amortization of  million 
this decrease in actual gross profits was mitigated by freestanding derivative gains associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations which resulted in an increase in actual gross profits and an increase in dac and voba amortization of million 
the widening of the company s nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guarantee liabilities  increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by million 
this was partially offset by higher risk margins which increased the guarantee liability valuations  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
reductions in both actual and expected cumulative earnings of the closed block resulting from recent experience in the closed block combined with changes in expected dividend scales resulted in an increase in closed block dac amortization of million  million of which was related to net investment gains losses 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses on dac amortization of million was attributable to numerous immaterial items 
increases in dac and voba amortization in resulting from changes in assumptions related to in force persistency of million were driven by higher than anticipated mortality and lower than anticipated premium persistency during the company s dac and voba balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains losses and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been recognized 
the increase in unrealized investment gains decreased the dac and voba balance by billion in the decrease in unrealized investment losses decreased the dac and voba balance by billion in  whereas the increase in unrealized investment losses increased the dac and voba balance by billion in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements include the dac and voba offset to unrealized investment losses 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach  which requires the use of estimates and judgment  at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment  if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  there might be an indication of impairment 
in such instances  the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition 
the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
the key inputs  judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings  current book value with and without accumulated other comprehensive income  the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business  long term growth rates  comparative market multiples  the account value of in force business  projections of new and renewal business  as well as margins on such business  the level of interest rates  credit spreads  equity market levels  and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the retirement products and individual life reporting units are particularly sensitive to the equity market levels 

table of contents we apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units 
the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate potential triggering events that may affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists 
deteriorating or adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result in future impairments of goodwill 
liability for future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  traditional annuities  certain accident and health  and non medical health insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  disability incidence  disability terminations  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumptions  additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations  expenses and interest 
liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
other policy related balances include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on life and non medical health insurance 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life policies are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
the assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac  and are thus subject to the same variability and risk 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index  such as the standard poor s ratings services s p index 
the company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing of these policies and guarantees and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 

table of contents reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products issued by third parties 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance agreements  the company determines whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company reviews all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting 
income taxes income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with its operations 
the company provides for federal  state and foreign income taxes currently payable  as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
for us federal income tax purposes  the company anticipates making an election under the internal revenue code section as it relates to the acquisition 
as such  the tax basis in the acquired assets and liabilities is adjusted as of the acquisition date resulting in a change to the related deferred income taxes 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
factors in management s determination consider the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established  as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in the financial statements 
a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company may be required to change its provision for income taxes when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change  or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances 
additionally  future events  such as changes in tax laws  tax regulations  or interpretations of such laws or regulations  could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate 
any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 

table of contents employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of the holding company sponsor and or administer pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the obligations and expenses associated with these plans require an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  healthcare cost trend rates  as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements  withdrawal rates and mortality 
in consultation with our external consulting actuarial firms  we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical performance of the plan and its assets  currently available market and industry data  and expected benefit payout streams 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to  among other factors  changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
litigation contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal actions and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims  the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the possible impact of tort reform efforts  the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known  and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis  the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
economic capital economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our businesses 
as a part of the economic capital process  a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of our businesses 
acquisitions and dispositions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  we have experienced growth and an increase in market share in several of our businesses  which  together with improved overall market conditions compared to conditions a year ago  positively impacted our results most significantly through increased net cash flows  improved yields on our investment portfolio and increased policy fee income 
sales of our domestic annuity products were up  driven by an increase in variable annuity sales compared with the prior year 
we benefited in from strong sales of structured settlement products 
market penetration continues in our pension closeout business in the uk  however  although improving  our domestic 
table of contents pension closeout business has been adversely impacted by a combination of poor equity returns and lower interest rates 
high levels of unemployment continue to depress growth across our group insurance businesses due to lower covered payrolls 
while we experienced growth in our group life business  sales of non medical health and individual life products declined 
sales of new homeowner and auto policies increased and  respectively  as the housing and automobile markets have improved 
we experienced a increase in sales of retirement and savings products abroad

during the year ended december   income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax increased billion to a gain of billion from a loss of billion in  of which million in losses was from the inclusion of one month of alico results in the change was predominantly due to a billion favorable change in net derivative gains losses and a billion favorable change in net investment gains losses 
offsetting these favorable variances totaling billion were unfavorable changes in adjustments related to net derivative and net investment gains losses of million  net of income tax  principally associated with dac and 
table of contents voba amortization  resulting in a total favorable variance related to net derivative and net investment gains losses  net of related adjustments and income tax  of billion 
we manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset liability management alm principles  focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities 
our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount  while optimizing  net of income tax  risk adjusted net investment income and risk adjusted total return 
our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments  with over of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
these securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities 
other invested asset classes including  but not limited to  equity securities  other limited partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint ventures  provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement in addition to supporting the cash flow and duration objectives of our investment portfolio 
we also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currencies  credit spreads and equity market levels 
additional considerations for our investment portfolio include current and expected market conditions and expectations for changes within our specific mix of products and business segments 
in addition  the general account investment portfolio includes within trading and other securities  contractholder directed investments supporting unit linked variable annuity type liabilities  which do not qualify for reporting and presentation as separate account assets 
the returns on these investments  which can vary significantly period to period include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase  inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances 
the composition of the investment portfolio of each business segment is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities  causing certain portfolios to be shorter in duration and others to be longer in duration 
accordingly  certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in longer duration  higher yielding fixed maturity securities  or certain sub sectors of fixed maturity securities  than other portfolios 
investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses 
however  net investment gains and losses are generated and can change significantly from period to period  due to changes in external influences  including movements in interest rates  foreign currencies  credit spreads and equity markets  counterparty specific factors such as financial performance  credit rating and collateral valuation  and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing  that can generate gains and losses 
as an investor in the fixed income  equity security  mortgage loan and certain other invested asset classes  we are exposed to the above stated risks  which can lead to both impairments and credit related losses 
freestanding derivatives are used to hedge certain investments and liabilities 
for those hedges not designated as accounting hedges  changes in these market risks can lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains losses without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged even though these are effective economic hedges 
additionally  we issue liabilities and purchase assets that contain embedded derivatives whose changes in estimated fair value are sensitive to changes in market risks and are also recognized in net derivative gains losses 
the favorable variance in net derivative gains losses of billion  from losses of billion in to losses of million in was primarily driven by a favorable change in freestanding derivatives of billion  comprised of a billion favorable change from losses in the prior year of billion to gains in the current year of million and million in alico freestanding derivative losses 
this favorable variance was partially offset by an unfavorable change in embedded derivatives primarily associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees of billion from gains in the prior year of billion to losses in the current year of million  net of million in alico embedded derivative gains 
we use freestanding interest rate  currency  credit and equity derivatives to provide economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities  including embedded derivatives  within certain of our variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
the billion favorable variance in freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to market factors  including falling long term and mid term interest rates  a stronger recovery in equity markets in the prior year than the current year  a greater decrease in equity volatility in the prior year as 
table of contents compared to the current year  a strengthening us dollar and widening corporate credit spreads in the financial services sector 
falling long term and mid term interest rates in the current year compared to rising long term and mid term interest rates in the prior year had a positive impact of billion on our interest rate derivatives  million of which is attributable to hedges of variable annuity minimum benefit guarantee liabilities  which are accounted for as embedded derivatives 
in addition  stronger equity market recovery and lower equity market volatility in the prior year as compared to the current year had a positive impact of billion on our equity derivatives  which we use to hedge variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
us dollar strengthening had a positive impact of million on certain of our foreign currency derivatives  which are used to hedge foreign denominated asset and liability exposures 
finally  widening corporate credit spreads in the financial services sector had a positive impact of million on our purchased protection credit derivatives 
certain variable annuity products with minimum benefit guarantees contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains losses 
these embedded derivatives also include an adjustment for nonperformance risk of the related liabilities carried at estimated fair value 
the billion unfavorable change in embedded derivatives was primarily attributable to the impact of market factors  including falling long term and mid term interest rates  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  equity volatility and equity market movements 
falling long term and mid term interest rates in the current year compared to rising long term and mid term interest rates in the prior year had a negative impact of billion

interest rate and equity market changes resulted in a decrease in variable annuity guarantee benefit costs 
partially offsetting this improvement was an increase in amortization of dac  voba and dsi 
the increase in operating earnings also includes the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in this improved reported operating earnings by million for compared to excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  operating earnings increased billion from the prior period

growth in our investment portfolio was primarily due to positive net cash flows from growth in our domestic individual and group life businesses  as well as certain international businesses  increased bank deposits  higher cash collateral balances received from our derivative counterparties  as well as the temporary investment of proceeds from the debt and common stock issuances in anticipation of the acquisition 
with the exception of the cash flows from such securities issuances  which were temporarily invested in lower yielding liquid investments  we continued to reposition the accumulated liquidity in our portfolio to longer duration and higher yielding investments 
since many of our products are interest spread based  higher net investment income is typically offset by higher interest credited expense 
however  interest credited expense  including amounts reflected in policyholder benefits and claims  decreased million  primarily in our domestic funding agreement business  which experienced lower average crediting rates combined with lower average account balances 
our fixed annuities business also experienced lower crediting rates 
certain crediting rates can move consistently with the underlying market indices  primarily the london inter bank offer rate libor  which were lower than the prior year 
the impact from the growth in our structured settlement  long term care and disability businesses partially offset those decreases in interest credited expense 
a significant increase in average separate account balances is largely attributable to favorable market performance resulting from improved market conditions since the second quarter of and positive net cash flows from the annuity business 
this resulted in higher policy fees and other revenues of million  most notably in our retirement products segment 
the improvement in fees is partially offset by greater dac  voba and dsi amortization of million 
policy fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets in the separate accounts 
dac  voba and dsi amortization is based on the earnings of the business  which in the retirement business are derived  in part  from fees earned on separate account balances 
a portion of the increase in amortization was due to the impact of higher current year gross margins  a primary component in the determination of the amount of amortization for our insurance products segment  mostly in the closed block resulting from increased investment yields and the impact of dividend scale reductions

high levels of unemployment continue to depress growth across most of our group insurance businesses due to lower covered payrolls 
growth in our group life business was dampened by a decline in our non medical health and individual life businesses 
however  our dental business benefited from higher enrollment and pricing actions  partially offset by lower persistency and the loss of existing subscribers  driven by high unemployment 
this business also experienced more stable utilization and benefits costs in the current year

our long term care revenues were flat year over year  concurrent with the discontinuance of the sale of this coverage at the end of in our individual life business  the change in revenues was suppressed by the impact of a benefit recorded in the prior year related to the positive resolution of certain legal matters 
excluding this impact  the traditional life business experienced growth in our open block of business 
the expected run off of our closed block more than offset this growth

the financial market turmoil in early resulted in extraordinarily high sales of fixed annuity products in the high sales level was not expected to continue after the financial markets returned to more stable levels 
variable annuity product sales increased primarily due to the expansion of alternative distribution channels and fewer competitors in the market place 
surrender rates for both our variable and fixed annuities remained low during the current period as we believe our customers continue to value our products compared to other alternatives in the marketplace 
interest rate and equity market changes were the primary driver of the million increase in operating earnings  with the largest impact resulting from a million increase in policy fees and other revenues  a million increase in net investment income  and a million decrease in variable annuity guarantee benefit costs  offset by a million increase in dac  voba and dsi amortization and a million increase in commission expense resulting from growth in annuity contract balances

as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of previously recorded taxes for in  banking  corporate other received a larger benefit of million as compared to related to the utilization of tax preferenced investments which provide tax credits and deductions 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unfavorable market conditions continued through  providing a challenging business environment 
the largest and most significant impact continued to be on our investment portfolio as declining yields resulted in lower net investment income 
market sensitive expenses were also negatively impacted by the market conditions as evidenced by an increase in pension and postretirement benefit costs 
higher levels of unemployment continued to impact certain group businesses as a decrease in covered payrolls reduced growth 
our auto and homeowners business was impacted by a declining housing market  the deterioration of the new auto sales market and the continuation of credit availability issues  all of which contributed to a decrease in insured exposures 
despite the challenging business environment  revenue growth remained solid in the majority of our businesses 
a flight to 
table of contents quality during the year contributed to an improvement in sales in both our domestic fixed and variable annuity products 
we also saw an increase in market share  especially in the structured settlement business  where we experienced an increase of in premiums 
an improvement in the global financial markets contributed to a recovery of sales in most of our international regions and resulted in improved investment performance in some regions during the second half of we also benefited domestically from a strong residential mortgage refinance market and healthy growth in the reverse mortgage arena

during the year ended december   metlife s income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax decreased billion to a loss of billion from income of billion in the comparable period 
the year over year change was predominantly due to a billion unfavorable change in net derivative gains losses to losses of billion in from gains of billion in  and a million unfavorable change in net investment gains losses 
offsetting these unfavorable variances totaling billion were favorable changes in adjustments related to net derivative and net investment gains losses of million  net of income tax  principally associated with dac and voba amortization  resulting in a total unfavorable variance related to net derivative and net investment gains losses  net of related adjustments and income tax  of billion 
we manage our investment portfolio using disciplined alm principles  focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities 
our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount  while optimizing  net of income tax  risk adjusted net investment income and risk adjusted total return 
our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments  with over of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 

table of contents these securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities 
other invested asset classes including  but not limited to equity securities  other limited partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint ventures provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement in addition to supporting the cash flow and duration objectives of our investment portfolio 
we also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currencies  credit spreads and equity market levels 
additional considerations for our investment portfolio include current and expected market conditions and expectations for changes within our unique mix of products and business segments 
the composition of the investment portfolio of each business segment is tailored to the unique characteristics of its insurance liabilities  causing certain portfolios to be shorter in duration and others to be longer in duration 
accordingly  certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in fixed maturity securities  or certain sub sectors of fixed maturity securities  than other portfolios 
investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses 
however  net investment gains and losses are generated and can change significantly from period to period  due to changes in external influences including movements in interest rates  foreign currencies and credit spreads  counterparty specific factors such as financial performance  credit rating and collateral valuation  and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing that can generate gains and losses 
as an investor in the fixed income  equity security  mortgage loan and certain other invested asset classes  we are exposed to the above stated risks  which can lead to both impairments and credit related losses 
in addition to the above risk management strategies  as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio  we use freestanding derivatives to hedge market risks including changes in interest rates  foreign currencies  credit spreads and the equity market 
we also use freestanding derivatives to hedge these same risks in certain of our liabilities  including variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
for those hedges not designated as an accounting hedge  changes in these market risks can lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains losses without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged even though these are effective economic hedges 
additionally  we issue liabilities and purchase assets that contain embedded derivatives whose changes in estimated fair value are sensitive to changes in market risks and are also recognized in net derivative gains losses 
the unfavorable variance in net derivative gains losses of billion  from gains of billion in to losses of billion in was primarily driven by an unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives of billion from gains in the prior period of billion to losses in the current period of billion 
this unfavorable variance was partially offset by a favorable change in embedded derivatives primarily associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees of billion from losses in the prior period of billion to gains in the current period of billion 
the billion unfavorable variance in freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to market factors  including rising interest rates  improving equity markets on equity options and futures  decreased equity volatility  weakening us dollar  and narrowing credit spreads 
long term and mid term interest rates increased in the current period which caused a negative impact of billion on our interest rate derivatives  billion of which is attributable to hedges of variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
equity markets improved while equity volatility decreased in the current period  which had a net negative impact of billion on our equity derivatives  which we use to hedge variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
weakening of the us dollar in the current period had a negative impact of million on certain foreign currency derivatives that are used to hedge foreign denominated asset and liability exposures 
narrowing corporate credit spreads had a negative impact of million on our purchased protection credit derivatives 
the variable annuity products with minimum benefit guarantees containing embedded derivatives are measured at fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains losses 
the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk of the related liabilities carried at estimated fair value 
the billion favorable change in embedded derivatives was primarily attributable to rising interest rates  improving equity market performance  a decrease in equity volatility  and weakening of the us dollar  which was offset by the 
table of contents unfavorable change in the adjustment for nonperformance risk 
both long term and mid term interest rates increased in the current period which had a positive impact of billion 
improving equity markets in the current period had a positive impact of billion 
lower equity market volatility in the current period compared to the prior period had a positive impact of million  and the weakening us dollar had a positive impact of million 
the favorable results from these hedged risks was partially offset by an unfavorable change related to the adjustment for nonperformance risk of billion  from gains of billion in to losses of billion in gains on the freestanding derivatives that hedged these embedded derivative risks more than offset the change in liabilities attributable to market factors  excluding the adjustment for nonperformance risk 
finally  there was a favorable change of billion for all other unhedged risks on the variable annuity minimum benefit guarantee liabilities 
the million unfavorable change in net investment gains losses was primarily attributable to higher net losses on mortgage loans and other limited partnership interests 
the increase in losses on mortgage loans was principally due to increases in mortgage valuation allowances resulting from weakening of the real estate market and other economic fundamentals 
the increase in losses on other limited partnership interests was principally due to higher impairments on certain cost method investments which experienced a reduction in net asset values of the underlying portfolio companies 
the underlying valuations of the portfolio companies have decreased due to the current economic environment 
as more fully described in the discussion of performance measures above  operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate performance and allocate resources

the volatile market conditions that began in and continued into impacted several key components of our operating earnings available to common shareholders including net investment income  hedging costs  and certain market sensitive expenses 
the markets also positively impacted our operating earnings available to common shareholders as conditions began to improve during  resulting in lower dac and dsi amortization 
a million decline in net investment income was the result of decreasing yields  including the effects of our higher quality  more liquid  but lower yielding investment position in response to the extraordinary market conditions 
the impact of declining yields caused a billion decrease in net investment income  which was partially offset by an increase of million due to growth in average invested assets calculated excluding unrealized gains and losses 
the decrease in yields resulted from the disruption and dislocation in the global financial markets experienced in  which continued  but moderated  in the adverse yield impact was concentrated in the following four invested asset classes fixed maturity securities primarily due to lower yields on floating rate securities from declines in short term interest rates and an increased allocation to lower yielding  higher quality  us treasury  agency and government guaranteed securities  to increase liquidity in response to the extraordinary market conditions  as well as decreased income on our securities lending program  primarily due to the smaller size of the program in the current year 
these adverse impacts were offset slightly as conditions improved late in and we began to reallocate our portfolio to higher yielding assets  real estate joint ventures primarily due to declining property valuations on certain investment funds that carry their real estate at estimated fair value and operating losses incurred on properties that were developed for sale by development joint ventures  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments primarily due to declines in short term interest rates  and mortgage loans primarily due to lower prepayments on commercial mortgage loans and lower yields on variable rate loans reflecting declines in short term interest rates 

table of contents equity markets experienced some recovery in  which led to improved yields on other limited partnership interests 
as many of our products are interest spread based  the lower net investment income was significantly offset by lower interest credited expense on our investment and insurance products 
the financial market conditions also resulted in a million increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit costs in our retirement products segment  as increased hedging losses were only partially offset by lower guaranteed benefit costs 
the key driver of the increase in other expenses stemmed from the impact of market conditions on certain expenses  primarily pension and postretirement benefit costs  reinsurance expenses and letter of credit fees 
these increases coupled with higher variable costs  such as commissions and premium taxes  some of which have been capitalized  more than offset the favorable impact of lower information technology  travel  professional services and advertising expenses  which include the impact of our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative 
the market improvement which began in the second quarter of was a key factor in the determination of our expected future gross profits  the increase of which triggered a decrease in dac and dsi amortization  most significantly in the retirement products segment 
the increase in our expected future gross profits stemmed primarily from an increase in the market value of our separate account balances  which is attributable  in part  to the improving financial markets 
our insurance products segment benefited  in the current year  from an increase in amortization of unearned revenue  primarily as a result of our annual review of assumptions that are used in the determination of the amount of amortization recognized 
these collective changes in amortization resulted in a million benefit  partially offsetting the declines in operating earnings available to common shareholders discussed above 
a portion of the decline in operating earnings available to common shareholders was caused by a million reduction in the results of our closed block of business  a specific group of participating life policies that were segregated in connection with the demutualization of mlic 
until early  the operating earnings of the closed block did not have a full impact on operating earnings as the operating earnings or loss was partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend obligation  a liability established at the time of demutualization 
however  in early the policyholder dividend obligation was depleted and  as a result  the total operating earnings or loss related to the closed block for the year ended december  was  and in the future may be a component of operating earnings 
business growth  from the majority of our businesses  along with net favorable mortality experience  had a positive impact on operating earnings available to common shareholders 
these impacts were somewhat dampened by higher benefit utilization in our dental business and mixed claim activity in our auto home segment 
in addition  our forward and reverse residential mortgage platform acquisitions in late benefited banking  corporate other s results

this resulted in lower net investment income and an increase in market sensitive expenses  primarily pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we also experienced higher utilization of dental benefits along with a lower number of recoveries in our disability business 
higher levels of unemployment continued to impact certain group businesses as a decrease in covered payrolls reduced growth 
however  revenue growth remained solid in all of our businesses 
revenue growth in our dental and individual life businesses reflected strong sales and renewals 
the significant components of the million decline in operating earnings were the aforementioned decline in net investment income  especially in the closed block business  partially offset by an increase in the amortization of unearned revenue  the impact of a reduction in dividends to certain policyholders and favorable mortality in the individual life business 
until early  the earnings of the closed block did not have a full impact on operating earnings as the earnings or loss was partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend obligation 
however  in early the policyholder dividend obligation was depleted and  as a result  the total operating earnings or loss related to the closed block for the year ended december  was  and in the future may be  a component of operating earnings 
this resulted in a million decline in operating earnings in the decrease in net investment income of million was primarily due to a million decrease from lower yields  partially offset by a million increase from growth in average invested assets 
yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global financial markets  which primarily impacted other invested assets  real estate joint ventures and fixed maturity securities 
in addition  income from our securities lending program decreased primarily due to the smaller size of the program in the growth in the average invested asset base was primarily from an increase in net flows from our individual life  non medical health  and group life businesses 
the moderate recovery in equity markets in led to improved yields on other limited partnership interests  which partially offset the overall reduction in yields 
to manage the needs of our intermediate to longer term liabilities  our portfolio consists primarily of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities  structured finance securities comprised of mortgage and asset backed securities  mortgage loans  and us treasury  agency and government guaranteed fixed maturity securities and  to a lesser extent  certain other invested asset classes 
table of contents including real estate joint ventures and other invested assets to provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement 
other expenses were essentially flat despite an increase of million from the impact of market conditions on certain expenses  primarily pension and postretirement benefit costs 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million  predominantly from declines in information technology  travel  and professional services  including the positive impact of our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative 
a further reduction of expenses was achieved through a decrease in variable expenses  such as commissions and premium taxes of million  a portion of which is offset by dac capitalization 
the aforementioned declines in operating earnings were partially offset by the favorable impact of a million decrease in policyholder dividends in the traditional life business  the result of a dividend scale reduction in the fourth quarter of in addition  favorable mortality in the individual life business was partially offset by higher benefit utilization in the dental business during  reflecting the negative employment trends in the marketplace 
the net impact of these two items benefited operating earnings by million 
the results were also favorably impacted by our review of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and margins  which in turn are factors in determining the amortization for dac and unearned revenue 
this review resulted in an unlocking event related to unearned revenue and  coupled with the impact from the prior year s review  generated an increase in operating earnings of million 
this increase was recorded in universal life and investment type product policy fees 
partially offsetting these increases was the impact of lower separate account balances  which resulted in lower fee income of million 
dac amortization reflects lower current year amortization of million  stemming from the impact of the improvement in the financial markets in  which increased our expected future gross profits  as well as lower current year gross margins in the closed block 
this decrease was partially offset by the net impact of refinements in both the prior and current years of million  the majority of which was recorded in the prior year as a result of the review of certain dac related assumptions

table of contents annuity sales have outpaced the industry  increasing our market share 
fixed annuity sales benefited from enhanced marketing on our income annuity with life contingency products  which increased our premium revenues by million  or  before income taxes 
in the annuity business  the movement in premiums is almost entirely offset by the related change in policyholder benefits  as the insurance liability that we establish at the time we assume the risk under these contracts is typically equivalent to the premium earned less the amount of acquisition expenses 
our average pab grew by billion in  primarily due to an increase in sales of fixed annuity products and more customers electing the fixed option on variable annuity sales 
this has a favorable impact on earnings by increasing net investment income  which is somewhat offset by higher interest credited expense 
unfavorable market conditions resulted in poor investment performance  which outweighed the impact of higher variable annuity sales on our separate account balances causing the average separate account balance to remain lower than the previous year 
this resulted in lower policy fees and other revenues which are based on daily asset balances in the policyholder separate accounts 
the improvement in the financial markets was the primary driver of the million increase in operating earnings  with the largest impact resulting in a decrease in dac  voba and dsi amortization of million 
the results reflected increased  or accelerated  amortization primarily stemming from a decline in the market value of our separate account balances 
a factor that determines the amount of amortization is expected future earnings  which in the annuity business are derived  in part  from fees earned on separate account balances 
the market value of our separate account balances declined significantly in  resulting in a decrease in the expected future gross profits  triggering an acceleration of amortization in beginning in the second quarter of  the market conditions began to improve and the market value of our separate account balances began to increase  resulting in an increase in the expected future gross profits and a corresponding lower level of amortization in also contributing to the increase in operating earnings was an increase in net investment income of million  which was primarily due to a million increase from growth in average invested assets and a million increase in yields 
the increase in average invested assets was due to increased cash flows from the sales of fixed annuity products and more customers electing the fixed option on variable annuity sales  which were reinvested primarily in fixed maturity securities  other invested assets and mortgage loans 
the increase in yields was due to moderate improvement in the equity markets in which led to an increase in yields principally for other limited partnership interests and certain other invested assets  which was partially offset by a decrease in yields on real estate joint ventures  reflecting the severe downturn in the global financial markets 
to manage the needs of our intermediate to longer term liabilities  our portfolio consists primarily of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities  structured finance securities  mortgage loans and us treasury  agency and government guaranteed fixed maturity securities and  to a lesser extent  certain other invested asset classes  including real estate joint ventures in order to provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement 
as is typically the case with fixed annuity products  higher net investment income was somewhat offset by higher interest credited expense 
growth in our fixed annuity policyholder account balances increased interest credited expense by million in and higher average crediting rates on fixed annuities increased interest credited expense by million 
operating earnings were negatively impacted by million of operating losses related to the hedging programs for variable annuity minimum death and income benefit guarantees  which are not embedded derivatives  partially offset by a decrease in the liability established for these variable annuity guarantees 
the various hedging strategies in place to offset the risk associated with these variable annuity guarantee benefits were more sensitive to market movements than the liability for the guaranteed benefit 
market volatility  improvements in the equity markets  and higher interest rates produced operating losses on these hedging strategies in the current year 
our hedging strategies  which are a key part of our risk management  performed as anticipated 
the decrease in annuity guarantee benefit liabilities was due to the improvement in the equity markets  higher interest rates and the annual unlocking of future market expectations 
other expenses increased by million primarily due to an increase of million from the impact of market conditions on certain expenses 
these expenses are largely comprised of reinsurance costs  pension and postretirement benefit expenses  and letter of credit fees 
in addition  variable expenses  such as commissions and premium taxes  increased million  the majority of which have been offset by dac capitalization 
the positive impact of our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative was reflected in lower travel

our pension closeout business in the u 
k 
continues to expand and experienced premium growth during of almost million  or before income taxes 
however  this growth was more than offset by a decline in our domestic pension closeout business driven by unfavorable market conditions and regulatory changes 
a combination of poor equity returns and lower interest rates have contributed to pension plans being under funded  which reduces our customers flexibility to engage in transactions such as pension closeouts 
our customers plans funded status may be affected by a variety of factors  including the ongoing phased implementation of the pension protection act of  a comprehensive reform of defined benefit and defined contribution plan rules 
for each of these businesses  the movement in premiums is almost entirely offset by the related change in policyholder benefits 
the insurance liability that is established at the time we assume the risk under these contracts is typically equivalent to the premium earned 
market conditions also contributed to a lower demand for several of our investment type products 
the decrease in sales of these investment type products is not necessarily evident in our results of operations as the transactions related to these products are recorded through the balance sheet 
our funding agreement products  primarily the libor based contracts  experienced the most significant impact from the volatile market conditions 
as companies seek greater liquidity  investment managers are refraining from repurchasing the contracts when they mature and are opting for more liquid investments 
in addition  unfavorable market conditions continued to impact the demand for global guaranteed interest contracts  a type of funding agreement 
policyholder account balances for our investment type products were down by approximately billion during  as issuances were more than offset by scheduled maturities 
however  due to the timing of issuances and maturities  the average policyholder account balances and liabilities increased from to the impact 
table of contents of the decrease in policyholder account balances resulted in lower net investment income  which was somewhat offset by lower interest credited expense 
the primary driver of the million decrease in operating earnings was lower net investment income of million reflecting a million decrease from lower yields and a million increase due to growth in average invested assets 
yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global financial markets which impacted real estate joint ventures  fixed maturity securities  other invested assets and mortgage loans 
in addition  income from our securities lending program decreased  primarily due to the smaller size of the program during the year 
to manage the needs of our longer term liabilities  our portfolio consists primarily of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  us treasury  agency and government guaranteed securities and  to a lesser extent  certain other invested asset classes including real estate joint ventures in order to provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement 
for our shorter term obligations  we invest primarily in structured finance securities  mortgage loans and investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities 
the yields on these investments have moved consistent with the underlying market indices  primarily libor and treasury  on which they are based 
the growth in the average invested asset base is consistent with the increase in the average policyholder account balances and liabilities 
as many of our products are interest spread based  the lower net investment income was somewhat offset by lower net interest credited expense of million 
the decrease in interest credited expense is attributed to million from lower crediting rates 
crediting rates have moved consistent with the underlying market indices  primarily libor  on which they are based 
the increase in the average policyholder account balances resulted in a million increase in interest credited expense 
the year over year decline in operating earnings was also due in part to lower other revenues as the prior year benefited by million in fees for the cancellation of a bank owned life insurance stable value wrap policy combined with the surrender of a global guaranteed interest contract 
in addition  a refinement to a reinsurance recoverable in the small business record keeping line of business in the latter part of also contributed million to the decrease in operating earnings 
current year results benefited from favorable liability refinements as compared to unfavorable liability refinements in  as well as improved mortality experience in the current year  all in the pension closeouts business 
these items improved operating earnings by approximately million 
other products generated mortality gains or losses  however  the net change did not have a material impact on our year over year results 
although our other expenses only increased marginally and are not a significant driver of the decrease in operating earnings  the general themes associated with the increase are consistent with those factors discussed above in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations 
market conditions triggered an increase in our pension and postretirement benefit expenses of million 
in addition  variable expenses  such as commissions and premium taxes  have increased million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million  primarily in information technology  travel and professional services expenses  all of which were largely due to our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative

in particular  we experienced a large decrease in earned exposures in massachusetts  whose market was impacted by a regulatory change  which resulted in a marked increase in competition 
a return to more normal weather conditions in resulted in fewer  and less severe  catastrophe events than in this was more than offset by an increase in both non catastrophe claim frequencies and non catastrophe claim severities in mixed claim experience and the impact of lower exposures were the primary drivers of the million decrease in operating earnings 
while we had a million decrease in catastrophe related losses compared to the prior year  we also recorded million less of a benefit in from favorable development of prior year non catastrophe losses 
current year claim costs rose primarily as a result of a million increase in claim frequency from both our auto and homeowners products 
in addition  we had a million net increase in claim severity  stemming from higher severity in our auto line of business that was partially offset by lower severity in our homeowners line of business 
in  we experienced a decline in insured exposures  which contributed approximately million to the decrease in operating earnings 
while this decrease in exposures had a positive impact on the amount of claims  it was more than offset by the negative impact on premiums 
the decrease in exposures is largely attributable to slightly higher non renewal rates  partially offset by greater sales of new policies 
also contributing to the decline in earnings was a decrease of million in the average premium per policy  which is primarily due to a shift in earned exposures to lower average premium states and an increase of million in loss adjustment expenses  primarily related to a decrease in unallocated loss adjusting expense liabilities at the end of the impact of the items discussed above can be seen in the unfavorable change in the combined ratio  excluding catastrophes  to in from in and the unfavorable change in the combined ratio  including catastrophes  to in from in a million decrease in other expenses  including the net change in dac  partially offset the declines in operating earnings discussed above 
this improvement resulted from decreases in sales related expenses and from minor fluctuations in a number of expense categories  a portion of which is due to our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative

we experienced growth in the pension  group life  and medical businesses of our latin america region  specifically in mexico 
our operations in europe and the middle east continue to have strong growth in the european variable annuity business 
the reduction in operating earnings includes the adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in as the us dollar strengthened against the various foreign currencies 
this decreased operating earnings by million in relative to excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  operating earnings increased million  or  from the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by higher operating earnings of million in our asia pacific region  while operating earnings from our latin america and europe and middle east decreased by million and million  respectively 
asia pacific 
improving financial market conditions was the primary driver of the increase in operating earnings 
net investment income in the region increased by million due to an increase of million from improved yields on our investment portfolio  million from the change in results of operating joint ventures  and million from an increase in average invested assets 
the increase in yields was primarily due to higher income of million on the trading and other securities portfolio  stemming from equity markets experiencing some recovery in as our trading and other securities portfolio backs unit linked policyholder liabilities  this increase in income was entirely offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense 
the income of the japan joint venture improved by million due to favorable investment results and lower amortization of dac and voba 
the decrease in dac and voba amortization was primarily due to an increase in the market value of 
table of contents the joint venture s separate account balances  which is directly tied to the improving financial markets 
a factor that determines the amount of dac and voba amortization is expected future fees earned on separate account balances 
since the market value of separate account balances have increased  it is expected that future earnings on this block of business will be higher than previously anticipated 
as a result  the amortization of dac and voba was less in the current year 
operating earnings in this region also benefited from higher surrender charges of million 
difficult economic conditions in south korea during the first half of the year resulted in a higher level of surrenders 
growth in our japan reinsurance business and an increase in reinsurance rates contributed million to the increase in operating earnings 
in addition  the favorable impact of a reduction in the liability for our variable annuity guarantees contributed million to operating earnings 
the change in the liability was primarily due to an increase in separate account balances in the japan joint venture 
these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns 
the scenarios use best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize dac 
because separate account balances have had positive returns relative to the prior year  current estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously projected which resulted in a decrease in this liability in the current period 
partially offsetting these increases  higher dac amortization of million resulted from business growth and favorable investment results

the decrease in operating earnings was primarily driven by lower net investment income 
net investment income decreased by million due to a decrease of million from lower yields  partially offset by an increase of million due to an increase in average invested assets 
the decrease in yields was due  in part  to the impact of changes in assumptions for measuring the effects of inflation on certain inflation indexed fixed maturity securities 
this decrease was partially offset by a reduction of million in the related insurance liability primarily due to lower inflation 
the increase in net investment income attributable to an increase in average invested assets was primarily due to business growth and  as such  was largely offset by increases in policyholder benefits and interest credited expense 
higher claims experience in mexico resulted in a million decline in operating earnings 
the nationalization and reform of the pension business in argentina impacted both years earnings  resulting in a net million decline in operating earnings 
in addition  operating earnings decreased due to a net income tax increase of million in mexico  resulting from a change in assumption regarding the repatriation of earnings  partially offset by the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate in partially offsetting these decreases in operating earnings was the combination of growth in mexico s individual and institutional businesses and higher premium rates in its institutional business  which increased operating earnings by million 
pesification in argentina impacted both the current year and prior year earnings  resulting in a net million increase in operating earnings 
this benefit was largely due to a reassessment of our approach in managing existing and potential future claims related to certain social security pension annuity contract holders in argentina resulting in a liability release 
lower expenses of million resulted primarily from the impact of operational efficiencies achieved through our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative 
europe and middle east 
the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and a tax benefit  both of which occurred in the prior year  contributed million to the decline in operating earnings 
our investment of million in our distribution capability and growth initiatives in also reduced operating earnings 
there was an increase in net investment income of million  which was due to an increase of million from an improvement in yields and million from an increase in average invested assets 
the increase in yields was primarily due to favorable results on the trading and other securities portfolio  stemming from the equity markets experiencing some recovery in as our trading and other securities portfolio backs unit linked policyholder liabilities  the trading and other securities portfolio results were entirely offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense 
the increase in net investment income attributable to an increase in average invested assets was primarily due to business growth and was largely offset by increases in policyholder benefits and interest credited expense  also due to business growth

during  we participated in the federal reserve bank of new york term auction facility  which provided short term liquidity with low funding costs 
in response to the economic crisis and unusual financial market events that occurred in and continued into  we decided to utilize excess debt capacity 
the holding company completed three debt issuances in the holding company issued million of floating rate senior notes in march  billion of senior notes in may  and million of junior subordinated debt securities in july in february  in connection with the initial settlement of the stock purchase contracts issued as part of the common equity units sold in june  the holding company issued common stock for billion

operating earnings available to common shareholders improved by million  of which million was due to metlife bank and its acquisitions of a residential mortgage origination and servicing business and a reverse mortgage business  both during excluding the impact of metlife bank  our operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased million  primarily due to lower net investment income  partially offset by the impact of a lower effective tax rate 
the lower effective tax rate provided an increased benefit of million from the prior year 
this benefit was the result of a partial settlement of certain prior year tax audit issues and increased utilization of tax preferenced investments  which provide tax credits and deductions 

table of contents excluding a million increase from metlife bank  net investment income decreased million  which was primarily due a decrease of million due to lower yields  partially offset by an increase of million due to an increase in average invested assets 
consistent with the consolidated results of operations discussion above  yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global financial markets  which primarily impacted fixed maturity securities and real estate joint ventures 
the increased average invested asset base was due to cash flows from debt issuances during our investments primarily include structured finance securities  investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities  us treasury  agency and government guaranteed fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
in addition  our investment portfolio includes the excess capital not allocated to the segments 
accordingly  it includes a higher allocation of certain other invested asset classes to provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement including leveraged leases  other limited partnership interests  real estate  real estate joint ventures and equity securities 
after excluding the impact of a million increase from metlife bank  other expenses increased by million 
deferred compensation costs  which are tied to equity market performance  were higher due to a significant market rebound 
we also had an increase in costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative 
these increases were partially offset by lower postemployment related costs and corporate related expenses  specifically legal costs 
legal costs were lower largely due to the prior year commutation of asbestos policies 
in addition  interest expense declined slightly as a result of rate reductions on variable rate collateral financing arrangements offset by debt issuances in and effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
inflation in the us has remained contained and been in a general downward trend for an extended period 
however  in light of recent and ongoing aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures by the us federal government and foreign governments  it is possible that inflation could increase in the future 
globally  inflation trends can vary by region and between developed and emerging markets 
the japanese economy  to which we face increased exposure as a result of the acquisition  continues to experience low nominal growth and a deflationary environment 
as the global economy improves  inflation trends are increasing in other regions  particularly in emerging markets like china and india 
in the more developed eurozone countries  inflation rates  while not as high  have trended upward at a greater pace than in the us an increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways 
during inflationary periods  the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses 
inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials  potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs can not be passed through in our product prices 
inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses  which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation 
prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally  and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy  which could constrain overall economic activity  inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities 
investments investment risks 
the company s primary investment objective is to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the company is exposed to four primary sources of investment risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  interest rate risk  relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates  
table of contents liquidity risk  relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions  and market valuation risk  relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads 
the company manages risk through in house fundamental analysis of the underlying obligors  issuers  transaction structures and real estate properties 
the company also manages credit risk  market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation 
for real estate and agricultural assets  the company manages credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic  property type and product type diversification and asset allocation 
the company manages interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management strategies  product design  such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  and proactive monitoring and management of certain non guaranteed elements of its products  such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments in the management of credit  interest rate  currency and equity market risks 
current environment 
the global economy and markets are now recovering from a period of significant stress that began in the second half of and substantially increased through the first quarter of this disruption adversely affected the financial services industry  in particular 
the us economy entered a recession in late this recession ended in mid  but the recovery from the recession has been below historic averages and the unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time 
in addition  inflation has fallen over the last several years and is expected to remain at low levels for some time 
some economists believe that some level of disinflation and deflation risk remains in the us economy 
although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated  not all such markets are functioning normally  and some remain reliant upon government intervention and liquidity 
the global recession and disruption of the financial markets has also led to concerns over capital markets access and the solvency of certain european union member states  including portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain 
the japanese economy  to which we face increased exposure to as a result of the acquisition  continues to experience low nominal growth  a deflationary environment  and weak consumer spending

during the year ended december   the net unrealized loss position on fixed maturity and equity securities improved from a net unrealized loss of billion at december  to a net unrealized gain of billion at december   as a result of a decrease in interest rates  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in credit spreads 
investment outlook 
recovering private equity markets and stabilizing credit and real estate markets during had a positive impact on returns and net investment income on private equity funds  hedge funds and real estate funds  which are included within other limited partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint venture portfolios 
although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated  if there is a resumption of significant disruption  it could adversely impact returns and net investment income on these alternative investment classes 
net cash flows arising from our business and our investment portfolio will be reinvested in a prudent manner and according to our alm discipline in appropriate assets over time 
we will maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet business needs 
net investment income may be adversely affected if excess liquidity is required over an extended period of time to meet changing business needs

valuation of securities 
we are responsible for the determination of estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity  equity and trading and other securities  as well as short term securities is determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information quoted market prices in active markets  independent pricing services  or independent broker quotations 
the number of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument 
generally  we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities  but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy 
independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on inputs that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or similar techniques 
the assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration  and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
when a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service  management will value the security primarily using independent non binding broker quotations 
independent non binding broker quotations utilize inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies  including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets  for ensuring that observable market prices and market based parameters are used for valuation  wherever possible  and for determining that judgmental valuation adjustments  if any  are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time 
we review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and ensure that any changes to valuation methodologies are justified 
we gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions  valuation methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through various controls designed to ensure that the financial assets and financial liabilities are appropriately valued and represent an exit price 
the control systems and procedures include  but are not limited to  analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns  comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates  comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market  reviewing the bid ask spreads to assess activity and ongoing confirmation that independent pricing services use  wherever possible  market based parameters for valuation 
we determine the observability of inputs used in 
table of contents estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data 
the company also follows a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value 
if we conclude that prices received from independent pricing services are not reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value  we will seek independent non binding broker quotes or use an internally developed valuation to override these prices 
such overrides are classified as level despite the credit events prevalent since the second half of described above  including market dislocation  volatility in valuation of certain investments  and reduced levels of liquidity  which has since moderated but is still present in certain portions of the global financial markets and in certain asset sectors  our internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value  which reflect our estimates of liquidity and non performance risks  compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services  did not produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed maturity securities portfolio 
our estimates of liquidity and non performance risks are generally based on available market evidence and on what other market participants would use 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
as a result  we generally continued to use the price provided by the independent pricing service under our normal pricing protocol and pricing overrides were not material 
the company uses the results of this analysis for classifying the estimated fair value of these instruments in level  or for example  we will review the estimated fair values received to determine whether corroborating evidence ie  similar observable positions and actual trades will support a level classification in the fair value hierarchy 
security prices which cannot be corroborated due to relatively less pricing transparency and diminished liquidity will be classified as level even some of our very high quality invested assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a result of the market conditions described above 
for privately placed fixed maturity securities  the company determines the estimated fair value generally through matrix pricing  discounted cash flow techniques or from independent pricing services after assessing that the observability of inputs used can be corroborated with observable market data 
the discounted cash flow valuations rely upon the estimated future cash flows of the security  credit spreads of comparable public securities and secondary transactions  as well as taking into account  among other factors  the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with privately placed debt securities 
the company has reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of its securities 
based on the results of this review and investment class analyses  each instrument is categorized as level  or based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation methodologies 
certain us treasury  agency and government guaranteed fixed maturity securities  certain foreign government fixed maturity securities  residential mortgage backed securities rmbs  principally to be announced securities  exchange traded common stock and mutual fund interests  registered mutual fund interests priced using daily net asset value provided by fund managers included within trading and other securities  certain other securities classified as trading and other securities which are similar to the above described fixed maturity and equity securities and certain short term money market securities  including us treasury bills  have been classified into level because of high volumes of trading activity and narrow bid ask spreads 
most securities valued by independent pricing services have been classified into level because the significant inputs used in pricing these securities are market observable or can be corroborated using market observable information 
most investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities and certain below investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities priced by independent pricing services that use observable inputs have been classified within level distressed privately placed fixed maturity securities have been classified within level below investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities and less liquid securities with very limited trading activity where estimated fair values are determined by independent pricing services or by independent non binding broker quotations that use unobservable inputs or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  are classified as level use of independent non binding broker quotations generally indicates there is a lack of liquidity or the general lack of transparency in the process to develop these price estimates causing them to be considered level effective april   the company adopted accounting guidance that clarified existing guidance regarding estimating the estimated fair value of an asset or liability if there was a significant decrease in the volume and level of trading activity for these assets or liabilities and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the 
table of contents company s valuation policies as described above and in summary of critical accounting estimates estimated fair values of investments already incorporated the key concepts from this additional guidance  accordingly  this guidance results in no material changes in our valuation policies 
at april  and at each subsequent quarterly period in and  we evaluated the markets that our fixed maturity and equity securities trade in and in our judgment  despite the increased illiquidity discussed above  believe none of these fixed maturity and equity securities trading markets should be characterized as distressed and disorderly 
we will continue to re evaluate and monitor such fixed maturity and equity securities trading markets on an ongoing basis 
fair value hierarchy 
fixed maturity securities and equity securities available for sale measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources and fair value hierarchy are as follows december  fixed maturity equity securities securities in millions level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level independent pricing source internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques significant other observable inputs level independent pricing source internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques independent broker quotations significant unobservable inputs total estimated fair value

level fixed maturity securities are priced principally through market standard valuation methodologies  independent pricing services and independent non binding broker quotations using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
level fixed maturity securities consists of less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies including alternative residential mortgage loan rmbs and less liquid prime rmbs  certain below investment grade private placements and less liquid investment grade corporate securities included in us and foreign corporate securities and less liquid abs including securities supported by sub prime mortgage loans included in abs 
during the year ended december   level fixed maturity securities increased by million  or  excluding the impact of the acquisition  and  million  or  including the impact of the acquisition 
the level fixed maturity securities acquired from alico of  million have been included in purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the table below 
the increase was driven by net purchases in excess of sales and increases in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
net purchases in excess of sales of fixed maturity securities were concentrated in foreign government and abs 
the increase in estimated fair value in fixed maturity securities was concentrated in us and foreign corporate securities and abs including rmbs backed by sub prime mortgage loans due to improving or stabilizing market conditions including an improvement in liquidity coupled with the effect of decreased interest rates on such securities 

table of contents a rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity securities and equity securities available for sale measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable level inputs is as follows year ended december  fixed maturity equity securities securities in millions balance  beginning of year total realized unrealized gains losses included in earnings other comprehensive income loss purchases  sales  issuances and settlements transfers into and or out of level balance  end of year includes securities acquired from alico of  million for fixed maturity securities and million for equity securities 
an analysis of transfers into and or out of level for the year ended december  is as follows total gains and losses in earnings and other comprehensive income loss are calculated assuming transfers in or out of level occurred at the beginning of the period 
items transferred in and out for the same period are excluded from the rollforward 
total gains and losses for fixed maturity securities included in earnings of million and other comprehensive income loss of million respectively  were incurred for transfers subsequent to their transfer to level  for the year ended december  net transfers into and or out of level for fixed maturity securities were million for the year ended december   and were comprised of transfers in of  million and transfers out of  million  respectively 
overall  transfers into and or out of level are attributable to a change in the observability of inputs 
assets and liabilities are transferred into level when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data 
this occurs when market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs cannot be observed  current prices are not available  and when there are significant variances in quoted prices  thereby affecting transparency 
assets and liabilities are transferred out of level when circumstances change such that a significant input can be corroborated with market observable data 
this may be due to a significant increase in market activity  a specific event  or one or more significant input s becoming observable 
transfers into and or out of any level are assumed to occur at the beginning of the period 
significant transfers in and or out of level assets and liabilities for the year ended december  are summarized below 
during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers into level of  million resulted primarily from current market conditions characterized by a lack of trading activity  decreased liquidity and credit ratings downgrades eg  from investment grade to below investment grade 
these current market conditions have resulted in decreased transparency of valuations and an increased use of broker quotations and unobservable inputs to determine estimated fair value principally for certain private placements included in us and foreign corporate securities and certain cmbs 
during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers out of level of  million resulted primarily from increased transparency of both new issuances that subsequent to issuance and establishment of trading activity  became priced by independent pricing services and existing issuances that  over time  the company was able to corroborate pricing received from independent pricing services with observable inputs  or there were increases in market activity and upgraded credit ratings primarily for certain us and foreign corporate securities  rmbs and abs

fixed maturity securities credit quality ratings 
the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners naic evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called naic designations 
if no rating is available from the naic  then as permitted by the naic  an internally developed rating is used 
the naic ratings are generally similar to the credit quality designations of the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations nrsros for marketable fixed maturity securities  called rating agency designations  except for certain structured securities as described below 
naic ratings and include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade ie  rated baa or better by moody s investors service moody s or rated bbb or better by s p and fitch ratings fitch by such rating organizations 
naic ratings through include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade ie  rated ba or lower by moody s or rated bb or lower by s p and fitch by such rating organizations 
the naic adopted revised rating methodologies for non agency rmbs  including rmbs backed by sub prime mortgage loans reported within abs  that became effective december  and for cmbs and all other abs that became effective december  the naic s objective with the revised rating methodologies for these structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses  and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities 
the revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from such structured securities 
the three tables below present fixed maturity securities based on rating agency designations and equivalent designations of the naic  with the exception of certain structured securities held by the company s insurance subsidiaries that file naic statutory financial statements 
non agency rmbs  including rmbs backed by sub prime mortgage loans reported within abs  cmbs and all other abs held by the company s insurance subsidiaries that file naic statutory financial statements are presented based on final ratings from the revised naic rating methodologies described above which may not correspond to rating agency designations

the following three tables present information about the company s fixed maturity securities holdings by naic credit quality ratings 
comparisons between naic ratings and rating agency designations are published by the naic 
rating agency designations are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the naic acceptable rating organizations list  including moody s  s p  fitch and realpoint  llc

table of contents creditworthiness 
the monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans  which include those that are classified as restructured  potentially delinquent  delinquent or in foreclosure  as well as loans with higher loan to value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios 
the monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar  with a focus on higher risk loans  such as loans with higher loan to value ratios  including reviews on a geographic and property type basis 
loan to value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans 
loan to value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans 
loan to value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
a loan to value ratio greater than indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a loan to value ratio of less than indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan 
for commercial mortgage loans  the average loan to value ratio was and at december  and  respectively  and the average debt service coverage ratio was x  as compared to x at december  for agricultural mortgage loans  the average loan to value ratio was at both december  and  respectively 
the values utilized in calculating these ratios are developed in connection with our review of the commercial and agricultural mortgage loans  and are updated routinely  including a periodic quality rating process and an evaluation of the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral

the company has a conservative residential mortgage loan portfolio and does not hold any option arms  sub prime or low teaser rate

additionally  the company s investment in traditional residential interest only mortgage loans was million and million at december  and  respectively 
mortgage loan valuation allowances 
the company s valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss  as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified  but for which the company expects to incur a loss 
accordingly  a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses 
the company records additions to and decreases in its valuation allowances and gains and losses from the sale of loans in net investment gains losses 
the company records valuation allowances for loans considered to be impaired when it is probable that  based upon current information and events  the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loans being impaired  loan specific valuation allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the loan over either i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent  or iii the loan s observable market price 
the company also establishes valuation allowances for loan losses for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics  such as property types  loan to value ratios and debt service coverage ratios when  based on past experience  it is probable that a credit event has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
these valuation allowances are based on loan risk characteristics  historical default rates and loss severities  real estate market fundamentals and outlook  as well as  other relevant factors 
the determination of the amount of  and additions or decreases to  valuation allowances is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with its loan portfolios 
such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors  including the company s experience for loan losses  defaults and loss severity  and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics 
these evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations 
table of contents regularly  which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised 
negative credit migration including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans will result in an increase in the valuation allowance 
positive credit migration including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance

fair value hierarchy 
derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy  are presented as follows december  derivative derivative assets liabilities in millions quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level total estimated fair value the valuation of level derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of level and level derivatives 
although level inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and are assumed to be consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments  the use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of level derivatives and could materially affect net income 
derivatives categorized as level at december  include interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve  interest rate lock commitments with certain unobservable inputs  including pull through rates  equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs or that are priced via independent broker quotations  foreign currency swaps which are cancelable and priced through independent broker quotations  interest rate swaps with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve  credit default swaps based upon baskets of credits having unobservable credit correlations  as well as credit default swaps with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the credit curves and credit default swaps priced through independent broker quotes  foreign currency forwards priced via independent broker quotations or with liquidity adjustments  implied volatility swaps with unobservable volatility inputs or that are priced via independent broker quotations  equity options with unobservable volatility inputs or that are priced via independent broker quotations  currency options based upon baskets of currencies having unobservable currency correlations  and credit forwards having unobservable repurchase rates

policyholder liabilities the company establishes  and carries as liabilities  actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered  an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events  or to provide for future annuity payments 
amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
for more details on policyholder liabilities  see summary of critical accounting estimates 
also see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of certain policyholder liabilities at december  and due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities  the company cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities  and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future 
however  we believe our actuarial liabilities for future benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to be paid to policyholders 
we periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience 
we revise estimates  to the extent permitted or required under gaap  if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities 
the company has experienced  and will likely in the future experience  catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism  and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including pandemics  hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  tornadoes  explosions  severe winter weather including snow  freezing water  ice storms and blizzards  fires and man made events such as terrorist attacks 
due to their nature  we cannot predict the incidence  timing  severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism  but we make broad use of catastrophic and non catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils 
future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of expected future benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of expected future net premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits include mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumed and future losses are projected under loss recognition testing  then additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
insurance products 
future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions  liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance  long term care ltc policies  active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under participating life insurance contracts 
in order to manage risk  the company has often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on new individual life insurance policies 
the reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage 
the company entered into various derivative positions  primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions  to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts 

table of contents retirement products 
future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life contingent income annuities  supplemental contracts with and without life contingencies  liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdbs included in certain annuity contracts  and a certain portion of guaranteed living benefits 
see variable annuity guarantees 
corporate benefit funding 
liabilities are primarily related to structured settlement annuities 
there is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities 
a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result 
the company has various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario 
auto home 
future policy benefits include liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies  levels of severities  inflation  judicial trends  legislative changes or regulatory decisions 
assumptions are based upon the company s historical experience and analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business  and consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
international 
future policy benefits are held primarily for traditional life and accident and health contracts in japan  asia pacific and immediate annuities in latin america 
they are also held for total return pass thru provisions included in certain universal life and savings products mainly in japan and latin america  and traditional life  endowment and annuity contracts sold in various countries in asia pacific 
they also include certain liabilities for variable annuity guarantees of minimum death benefits  and longevity guarantees sold in japan and asia pacific 
finally  in europe and the middle east  they also include unearned premium liabilities established for credit insurance contracts covering death  disability and involuntary loss of employment  as well as traditional life  accident and health and endowment contracts 
factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at issue  lower than expected asset reinvestment rates  higher than expected lapse rates  asset default and more rapid improvement of mortality levels than anticipated for life contingent immediate annuities 
the company mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and through the development of periodic experience studies 
see variable annuity guarantees 
estimates for the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses are reset as actuarial indications change and these changes in the liability are reflected in the current results of operation as either favorable or unfavorable development of prior year losses

policyholder account balances policyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value  which includes accrued interest credited  but exclude the impact of any applicable surrender charge that may be incurred upon surrender 
insurance products 
policyholder account balances are held for death benefit disbursement retained asset accounts  universal life policies  the fixed account of variable life insurance policies  specialized life insurance products for benefit programs and general account universal life policies 
policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate set by the company  which are influenced by current market rates 
the majority of the policyholder account balances have a guaranteed minimum credited rate between and 
a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees 
the company has various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors  to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario

corporate benefit funding 
policyholder account balances are comprised of funding agreements 
interest crediting rates vary by type of contract  and can be fixed or variable 
variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index  most commonly month or month libor 
metlife is exposed to interest rate risks  and foreign exchange risk when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date 
the company may invest in floating rate assets  or enter into floating rate swaps  also tied to external indices  as well as caps to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company also mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and seeks to hedge all foreign currency risk through the use of foreign currency hedges  including cross currency swaps 
international 
policyholder account balances are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans in japan and latin america and to a lesser degree  amounts for unit linked type funds in certain countries across all regions that do not meet the gaap definition of separate accounts 
also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in japan and asia pacific that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees 
liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in japan and asia pacific are established in accordance with derivatives and hedging guidance and are also included within policyholder account balances 
these liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates  where there are interest rate guarantees 
the company mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and by hedging its variable annuity guarantees 
liabilities for unit linked type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments  as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder 
see variable annuity guarantees 
variable annuity guarantees the company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit ie  the benefit base less withdrawals 
in some cases the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits  bonus amounts  accruals or market value resets 
these guarantees are accounted for as insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on how and when the benefit is paid 
specifically  a guarantee is accounted for as an embedded derivative if a guarantee is paid without requiring i the occurrence of specific insurable event  or ii the policyholder to annuitize 
alternatively  a guarantee is accounted for as an insurance liability if the guarantee is paid only upon either i the occurrence of a specific insurable event  or ii upon annuitization 
in certain cases  a guarantee may have elements of both an insurance liability and an embedded derivative and in such cases the guarantee is accounted for under a split of the two models 
the net amount at risk nar for guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the nar disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements represents management s estimate of the current value of the benefits under these guarantees if they were all exercised simultaneously at december  and  respectively 
however  there are features  such as deferral periods and benefits requiring annuitization or death  that limit the amount of benefits that will be payable in the near future 
guarantees  including portions thereof  accounted for as embedded derivatives  are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances 
guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include gmab  the non life contingent portion of gmwb and the portion of certain gmib that do not require annuitization

the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk 
in connection with this adjustment  gains losses of million and  million are included in the gains losses of million and  million in net derivative gains losses for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  equity volatility  interest rates or foreign exchange rates 
additionally  because the estimated fair value for guarantees accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk  a decrease in the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to increase 
conversely  a widening of the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease 
the company uses derivative instruments and reinsurance to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
the derivative instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures  equity options and variance swaps  and interest rate swaps 
the change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk is not hedged

table of contents additionally  included in net derivative gains losses for the years ended december  and were gains losses of million and  respectively  related to ceded reinsurance 
guarantees  including portions thereof  have liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits 
guarantees accounted for in this manner include gmdbs  the life contingent portion of certain gmwb  and the portion of gmib that require annuitization 
these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns 
the scenarios use best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize deferred acquisition costs 
when current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected  liabilities will increase  resulting in a current period charge to net income 
the opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected 
at each reporting period  the company updates the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings 
the table below contains the carrying value for guarantees included in future policy benefits at december  in millions us business guaranteed minimum death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit international guaranteed minimum death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit total included in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended december  is a charge of million and for the year ended december  is a credit of million  related to the respective change in liabilities for the above guarantees 
the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the company uses reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
derivative instruments used are primarily equity futures  treasury futures and interest rate swaps 
included in policyholder benefits and claims associated with the hedging of the guarantees in future policy benefits for the year ended december  and were gains losses of million and million  respectively  related to reinsurance treaties containing embedded derivatives carried at estimated fair value and gains losses of million and million  respectively  related to freestanding derivatives 
while the company believes that the hedging strategies employed for guarantees included in both policyholder account balances and in future policy benefits  as well as other management actions  have mitigated the risks related to these benefits  the company remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay 
certain of the company s reinsurance agreements and most derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements  both of which  significantly reduces the exposure to counterparty risk 
in addition  the company is subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality  combined with adverse market events  produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed 
lastly  because the valuation of the guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk that is not hedged  changes in the nonperformance risk may result in significant volatility in net income 

table of contents other policy related balances other policy related balances include policy and contract claims  unearned revenue liabilities  premiums received in advance  policyholder dividends due and unpaid  and policyholder dividends left on deposit 
the liability for policy and contract claims generally relates to incurred but not reported death  disability  ltc and dental claims  as well as claims that have been reported but not yet settled 
the liability for these claims is based on the company s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims 
the company derives estimates for the development of incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development for each line of business 
the methods used to determine these estimates are continually reviewed 
adjustments resulting from this continuous review process and differences between estimates and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
the unearned revenue liability relates to universal life type and investment type products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods 
the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the product s estimated gross profits and margins  similar to deferred acquisition costs 
such amortization is recorded in universal life and investment type product policy fees 
also included in other policy related balances are policyholder dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and policyholder dividends left on deposit 
such liabilities are presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders 
policyholder dividends payable policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies 
liquidity and capital resources overview our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy  generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
the global economy and markets are now recovering from a period of significant stress that began in the second half of and substantially increased through the first quarter of this disruption adversely affected the financial services industry  in particular 
consequently  financial institutions paid higher spreads over benchmark us treasury securities than before the market disruption began 
the us economy entered a recession in late this recession ended in mid  but the recovery from the recession has been below historic averages and the unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time 
although conditions in the financial markets continued to materially improve in  there is still some uncertainty as to whether the stressed conditions that prevailed during the market disruption could recur  which could affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs and obtain capital 
liquidity management based upon the strength of its franchise  diversification of its businesses and strong financial fundamentals  we continue to believe the company has ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and unlikely but reasonably possible stress scenarios 
the company s short term liquidity position cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  excluding cash collateral received under the company s securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities  and cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivative instruments was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for the holding company and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities 

table of contents the company liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs 
liquidity needs are determined from a rolling month forecast by portfolio of investment assets and are monitored daily 
asset mix and maturities are adjusted based on the forecast 
cash flow testing and stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity  which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal 
the company includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products  including general account institutional pension products generally group annuities  including funding agreements  and certain deposit fund liabilities sold to employee benefit plan sponsors 
certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product 
in the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs  the company has various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need 
these options include cash flows from operations  the sale of liquid assets  global funding sources and various credit facilities 
under certain stressful market and economic conditions  the company s access to  or cost of  liquidity may deteriorate 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements  the company may have difficulty selling investment assets in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than the company otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
in addition  in the event of such forced sale  accounting rules require the recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities based upon the company s ability to hold such securities  which may negatively impact the company s financial condition 
in extreme circumstances  all general account assets other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose within a statutory legal entity are available to fund obligations of the general account within that legal entity 
capital the company s capital position is managed to maintain its financial strength and credit ratings and is supported by its ability to generate strong cash flows at the operating companies  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise additional capital to meet its operating and growth needs 
the company raised new capital from its debt issuances during the difficult market conditions prevailing since the second half of  as well as during the rebound and recovery periods beginning in the second quarter of see the company liquidity and capital sources debt issuances and other borrowings 
the increase in credit spreads experienced since then has resulted in an increase in the cost of such new capital  as well as increases in facility fees 
conversely  as a result of reductions in interest rates  the company s interest expense and dividends on floating rate securities have been lower 
despite the still unsettled financial markets  the company also raised new capital from a successful offering of the holding company s common stock in august  which provided financing for the acquisition 
see the company liquidity and capital sources common stock 
rating agencies 
rating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to the holding company s domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to the holding company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and equity capital of the company are among the many factors considered in determining the company s insurer financial strength and credit ratings 
each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors 
in addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies  rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

table of contents a downgrade in the credit or insurer financial strength ratings of the holding company or its subsidiaries would likely impact the cost and availability of financing for the company and its subsidiaries and result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
statutory capital and dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements 
except for american life  rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action 
rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and statutory reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis 
the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
these rules apply to each of the holding company s domestic insurance subsidiaries

all estimated cash payments presented in the table above are undiscounted as to interest  net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than years from the present date 
the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amount of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to the time value of money  which accounts for at least of the difference  as well as differences in assumptions  most significantly mortality  between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date 
for the majority of the company s insurance operations  estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balance liabilities as presented in the table above are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes 
these cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under gaap 
see policyholder account balances below 
actual cash payments to policyholders may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented in the table above due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments 
policyholder account balances policyholder account balances include liabilities related to conventional guaranteed interest contracts  guaranteed interest contracts associated with formal offering programs  funding agreements  individual and group annuities  total control accounts  individual and group universal life  variable universal life and company owned life insurance

these amounts relate to policies where the company is currently making payments and will continue to do so  as well as those where the timing of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts involve payment obligations where the timing of future payments is uncertain and where the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death  or where the occurrence of the payment triggering event  such as a surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  is outside the control of the company

liabilities related to unearned revenue and negative voba of billion and billion  respectively  have been excluded from the cash payments presented in the table above because they reflect accounting conventions and not contractual obligations 
with the exception of policyholder dividends left on deposit  and those items excluded as noted in the preceding sentence  the contractual obligation presented in the table above related to other policy related balances is equal to the liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
such amounts are reported in the one year or less category due to the short term nature of the liabilities 
contractual obligations on policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity 
b 
policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies 
as such  the contractual obligation related to policyholder dividends payable is presented in the table above in the one year or less category at the amount of the liability presented in the consolidated balance sheet 
c 
the nature of the policyholder dividend obligation is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long term projection of the performance of the closed block  we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability  if any  presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category 
this was presented to reflect the long duration of the liability and the uncertainty of the ultimate cash payment 
payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions the company has accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivative transactions 
as the securities lending transactions expire within the next year or the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain  the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table above 
the company also holds non cash collateral  which is not reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet  of million at december  bank deposits bank deposits of billion exceed the amount on the balance sheet of billion due to the inclusion of estimated interest payments 
liquid deposits  including demand deposit accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts  are assumed to mature at carrying value within one year 
certificates of deposit are assumed to pay all interest and principal at maturity 
short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities amounts presented in the table above for short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts presented in the table above do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase 
table of contents accounting fair value adjustments 
the amounts presented above also include interest on such obligations as described below 
short term debt consists of borrowings with original maturities of one year or less carrying fixed interest rates 
the contractual obligation for short term debt presented in the table above represents the principal amounts due upon maturity plus the related interest for the period from january  through maturity 
long term debt bears interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from january  through maturity 
interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
long term debt also includes payments under capital lease obligations of million  million  and million  in the one year or less  more than one year to three years  more than three years to five years and more than five years categories  respectively 
long term debt presented in the table above excludes  million at december  of long term debt relating to cses 
collateral financing arrangements bear interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from january  through maturity 
interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
pursuant to these collateral financing arrangements  the holding company may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the respective unaffiliated financial institutions 
see the company liquidity and capital sources collateral financing arrangements 
junior subordinated debt securities bear interest at fixed interest rates through their respective redemption dates 
interest was computed using the stated rates on the obligations for the period from january  through the scheduled redemption dates as it is the company s expectation that the debt will be redeemed at that time 
inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by billion 
commitments to lend funds the company commits to lend funds under mortgage loans  partnerships  bank credit facilities  bridge loans and private corporate bond investments 
in the table above  the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration date of the commitment 
as it relates to commitments to lend funds to partnerships and under bank credit facilities  the company anticipates that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years  however  as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted  such obligations are presented in the one year or less category in the table above 
commitments to fund bridge loans are short term obligations and  as a result  are presented in the one year or less category in the table above 
see off balance sheet arrangements 
operating leases as a lessee  the company has various operating leases  primarily for office space

if the timing of any of the other liabilities is sufficiently uncertain  the amounts are included within the one year or less category 
the other liabilities presented in the table above differ from the amount presented in the consolidated balance sheet by billion due primarily to the exclusion of items such as legal liabilities  pension and postretirement benefit obligations  taxes due other than income tax  unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest  accrued severance and employee incentive compensation and other liabilities such as deferred gains and losses 
such items have been excluded from the table above as they represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations

current income tax payable is also excluded from the table

the holding company is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding 
these markets  which serve as cost effective sources of funds  are critical components of the holding company s liquidity and capital management 
decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs  prospective views of balance 
table of contents sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure 
a disruption in the financial markets could limit the holding company s access to liquidity 
the holding company s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies 
we view our capital ratios  credit quality  stable and diverse earnings streams  diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings

liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics  including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio  timing differences in short term cash flow obligations  access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on the holding company s liquidity 
liquidity and capital sources dividends from subsidiaries 
the holding company relies in part on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements 
the holding company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles 
the dividend limitation for us insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year 
statutory accounting practices  as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which the company conducts business  differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap

the regulators of the non us operations  including the japan branch of american life  may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the us if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the operations of the non us operations  or for other reasons 
most of the non us subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries and are not directly owned by the holding company 
the capital and rating considerations applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into the holding company 
the company s management actively manages its target and excess capital levels and dividend flows on a pro active basis and forecasts local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle 
the dividend capacity of certain us and us subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market 
management of the holding company cannot provide assurances that the holding company s subsidiaries will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the holding company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends and that the applicable regulators will not disapprove any dividends that such subsidiaries must submit for approval

market risk exposures the company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity market 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes results most significantly from its holdings of fixed maturity securities  as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term interest rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt  policyholder account balances related to certain investment type contracts  and net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits 
table of contents which have the same type of interest rate exposure medium and long term interest rates as fixed maturity securities 
the company employs product design  pricing and alm strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate movements 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset credited rates for certain products 
alm strategies include the use of derivatives and duration mismatch limits 
see risk factors changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from its holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity and equity securities  mortgage loans  and certain liabilities  as well as through its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the company s investment portfolios are the euro  the japanese yen and the canadian dollar 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency risk in the company s liabilities are the british pound  the euro and the swiss franc 
selectively  the company uses us dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities 
through its investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures  the company is primarily exposed to the mexican peso  the japanese yen  the south korean won  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the chilean peso  the australian dollar  the argentine peso  the polish zloty  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
in addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps  forwards and options  local surplus in some countries is held entirely or in part in us dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
the company has matched much of its foreign currency liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing its risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
see risk factors fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our profitability 
equity market 
the company has exposure to equity market risk through certain liabilities that involve long term guarantees on equity performance such as net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits  certain policyholder account balances along with investments in equity securities 
we manage this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our alm strategies including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits 
the company also manages equity market risk exposure in its investment portfolio through the use of derivatives 
equity exposures associated with other limited partnership interests are excluded from this section as they are not considered financial instruments under gaap 
management of market risk exposures the company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk  including the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk management 
to manage interest rate risk  the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models  including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
the new york state insurance department regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of alm and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the business segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 

table of contents common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each asset portfolio has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments  derivatives or curve mismatch strategies 
foreign currency exchange rate risk management 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is assumed primarily in three ways investments in foreign subsidiaries  purchases of foreign currency denominated investments in the investment portfolio and the sale of certain insurance products 
the company s treasury department is responsible for managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries 
limits to exposures are established and monitored by the treasury department and managed by the investment department 
the investment department is responsible for managing the exposure to foreign currency investments 
exposure limits to unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the standing authorizations granted to management by the board of directors and are reported to the board of directors on a periodic basis 
the lines of business are responsible for establishing limits and managing any foreign exchange rate exposure caused by the sale or issuance of insurance products 
metlife uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments  its equity exposure in subsidiaries and its foreign currency exposures caused by the sale of insurance products 
equity market risk management 
equity market risk exposure through the issuance of variable annuities is managed by the company s asset liability management unit in partnership with the investment department 
equity market risk is realized through its investment in equity securities and is managed by its investment department 
metlife uses derivatives to hedge its equity exposure both in certain liability guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefit and equity securities 
these derivatives include exchange traded equity futures  equity index options contracts and equity variance swaps 
the company also employs reinsurance to manage these exposures 
hedging activities 
metlife uses derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and equity risk 
derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on accounting results and gaap and statutory capital 
the construction of the company s derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged 
some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets 
the company s use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows risks related to living guarantee benefits the company uses a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the risk associated with variable annuity living guarantee benefits 
these hedges include equity and interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  currency futures forwards  equity indexed options and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps 
minimum interest rate guarantees for certain company liability contracts  the company provides the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate 
these contracts include certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities 
the company purchases interest rate floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees 
reinvestment risk in long duration liability contracts derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts  such as deferred annuities 
hedges include zero coupon interest rate swaps and swaptions 

table of contents foreign currency risk the company uses currency swaps and forwards to hedge foreign currency risk 
these hedges primarily swap foreign currency denominated bonds  investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity exposures to us dollars 
general alm hedging strategies in the ordinary course of managing the company s asset liability risks  the company uses interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors and inflation swaps 
these hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows 
risk measurement sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing the analysis summarized below  the company used market rates at december  the sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of the company s market risk exposures interest rate  equity market and foreign currency exchange rate relating to its trading and non trading assets and liabilities 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of its market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent estimated fair values of the company s foreign currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates  and the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity market prices 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot ensure that its actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  for the derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the period 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of its management 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity exposures 
the table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair value for each market risk exposure of the company s market sensitive assets and liabilities at december  december  in millions non trading interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk equity market risk trading interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk
