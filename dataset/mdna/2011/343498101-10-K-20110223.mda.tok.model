the company produces breads  buns  rolls  tortillas  snack cakes and pastries that are distributed fresh to us customers in the southeast  mid atlantic  and southwest as well as select markets in california and nevada and frozen to customers nationwide 
our businesses are organized into two reportable segments dsd and warehouse delivery 
the dsd segment focuses on the production and marketing of bakery products to us customers in the southeast  mid atlantic  and southwest as well as select markets in california and nevada primarily through its dsd system 
the warehouse delivery segment produces snack cakes for sale to co pack  retail and vending customers nationwide as well as frozen bread  rolls and buns and tortillas for sale to retail and foodservice customers nationwide primarily through warehouse distribution 
we aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvement in the operating results of our existing businesses and  after detailed analysis  acquiring businesses and properties that add value to the company 
we believe this consistent and sustainable growth will build value for our shareholders 
sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions and product line extensions  marketing and service 
the company manages these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring its higher margin branded products  while using store branded products to absorb overhead costs and maximize use of production capacity 
sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased volume and the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity vie  as discussed in note  variable interest entity  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k  partially offset by favorable pricing and mix shifts 
during fiscal  our sales were negatively impacted by the weakened economy  the competitive landscape and higher promotional activity within the baking industry 
while the company expects sales to grow  it cannot guarantee at what level considering the current economic environment and competitive landscape in the baking industry 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  periodically experience price fluctuations  and  for that reason  we continually monitor the market for these commodities 
the cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation  weather conditions  domestic and international demand or other unforeseen circumstances 
agricultural commodity prices reached all time high levels during and the first half of before declining during commodity prices began to rise in the second half of and are expected to continue rising during we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting to reduce the impact of such volatility in raw material prices 
any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings 
critical accounting estimates note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  
table of contents the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and disclosure of the company s critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
the following is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates  and the accounting policies and methods listed below which are used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  derivative instruments  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles  self insurance reserves  income tax expense and accruals  and pension obligations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
independent distributors receive a discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers 
the company records such amounts as selling  distribution and administrative expenses 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase distributor discounts  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in selling  distribution and administrative expenses at the time the discount is offered 
the consumer packaged goods industry has used scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
consequently  revenue is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer 
this technology is referred to as pay by scan pbs 
the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs  and there has been a sharp increase in its use since that time 
the company believes it is a baked foods industry leader in pbs and utilizes this technology with a majority of its larger retail customers such as wal mart  kroger  food lion and winn dixie 
in fiscal the company recorded million in sales through pbs 
the company will continue to implement pbs technology for current pbs customers as they open new retail stores during in addition  new pbs customers will begin implementation during revenue on pbs sales is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer because that is when title and risk of loss is transferred 
non pbs sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer ie the independent distributor or retail customers since that is when title and risk of loss is transferred 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information on pbs and the significant accounting policies associated with pbs 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to certain commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting to manage the impact of volatility in raw material prices 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to long lived assets were necessary for fiscal years or there was an impairment charge of million recorded in fiscal  as discussed below in results of operations 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two step process 
the first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment  or reporting unit  with which the goodwill is associated 
this fair value is calculated as the average of projected ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization using a reasonable multiplier and projected revenue using a reasonable multiplier 
this fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit  and if less than the carrying value  the goodwill is measured for potential impairment under step two 
under step two of this calculation  goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  determined in the same manner as a business combination  with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to goodwill were necessary for the fiscal years   or in connection with acquisitions  the company has acquired trademarks  customer lists and non compete agreements  which are intangible assets subject to amortization 
the company evaluates these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the undiscounted future cash flows of each intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to amortizable intangible assets were necessary for the fiscal years   or the company also owns trademarks acquired in acquisitions that are intangible assets not subject to amortization 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in addition  the useful life is evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life 
the fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to fair value 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to intangible assets not subject to amortization were necessary for the fiscal years   or see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further information relating to the company s goodwill and other intangible assets 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  auto liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data 
though the company does not expect them to do so  actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated 
material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
income tax expense and accruals 
the annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate 
the effect of these changes  if any  would be recognized when the change takes place 

table of contents deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserve for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance  which could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
periodically we face audits from federal and state tax authorities  which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact the ultimate payment of such potential exposures 
while the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not currently believe that future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  the irs completed the audit of fiscal years and the results of the audit were immaterial  and the company is no longer subject to federal examination for years prior to see note  income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information on income taxes 
pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plans based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations reflect key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans portfolios  past performance of these assets  the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  and other factors 
material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to experience different than assumed and changes in these assumptions 
future benefit obligations and annual pension costs could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
effective january   the company curtailed its largest defined benefit plan that covered the majority of its workforce 
benefits under this plan were frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under this plan 
the company continues to maintain another defined benefit plan that covers a small number of union employees 
effective august   the company assumed sponsorship of two defined benefit plans as part of the butterkrust acquisition 
benefits under these plans are frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under these plans 
the company recorded pension cost of million for fiscal a quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s fiscal pension cost by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point change in the long term expected rate of return assumption would impact the company s fiscal pension cost by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
a quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
the company expects pension income of approximately million for fiscal the discount rate used by the company reflects rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company looks to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments to determine its discount rate 
the company uses a cash flow matching technique to select the discount rate 
the expected cash flows of each pension plan are matched to a yield curve based on aa graded bonds available in the marketplace at the measurement date 
a present value is developed  which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date  the company considers the plan assets historical actual returns  targeted asset allocations  and the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  based on the company s investment strategy 
while appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance  the assumption represents management s best estimate of the long term prospective return 
based on these factors the long term rate of return assumption for the plans was set at for fiscal  as compared with the average annual return on the 
table of contents plans assets over the past years of approximately net of expenses 
the expected long term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities  real estate  other diversifying strategies including  absolute return funds  hedged equity funds  and guaranteed insurance contracts  and short term investments and cash 
the company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension costs do not include an explicit expense assumption and the return on assets rate reflects the long term expected return  net of expenses 
the company determines the fair value of substantially all its plans assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans projected benefit obligations pbo 
if the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of the larger of i the pbo or ii the market value of plan assets  the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the expected average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plans 
the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
the company uses a calendar year end for the measurement date since the plans are based on a calendar year and because it approximates the company s fiscal year end 
amortization of this unrecognized loss during fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
to the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized  then this loss will increase the company s pension costs in the future

the increase in non retail and other sales  which include contract production and vending  was due primarily to the acquisitions  partially offset by decreases in vending 
materials  supplies  labor and other production costs exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately 
the decrease as a percent of sales was primarily due to significant decreases in ingredient costs 
these were partially offset by sales declines  higher workforce related costs as a percent of sales  start up costs for new production lines and higher costs as a percent of sales for the companies acquired in commodities  such as our baking ingredients  periodically experience price fluctuations  and  for that reason  we continually monitor the market for these commodities 
the commodities market continues to be volatile 
agricultural commodity prices reached all time high levels during and the first half of before declining during commodity prices increased in the second half of and are expected to continue rising in the cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation  weather conditions  
table of contents domestic and international demand or other unforeseen circumstances

table of contents net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
the company maintains a transportation agreement with an entity that transports a significant portion of the company s fresh bakery products from the company s production facilities to outlying distribution centers 
the company represents a significant portion of the entity s revenue 
this entity qualified as a vie for reporting periods prior to january  under previous accounting guidance  and all the earnings of the vie were eliminated through noncontrolling interest because the company did not have an equity ownership interest in the vie 
in  the fasb amended the consolidation principles associated with vie accounting by replacing the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in the vie with a qualitative approach 
the qualitative approach is focused on identifying which company has both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
as a result of this qualitative analysis  the company is no longer required to consolidate the vie beginning on january  at adoption

all the earnings of the vie were eliminated through noncontrolling interest due to the company not having any equity ownership in the vie

it is generally the company s policy not to provide third party guarantees 
no liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements with respect to such guarantees 
when an independent distributor terminates its relationship with the company  the company  although not legally obligated  generally purchases and operates that territory utilizing the truck of the former distributor

the individuals will receive shares of our common stock equal to the dollar amount of their election divided by the company s common stock price on january  a total of approximately  deferred shares will be issued throughout the election dates chosen

guarantees and indemnification obligations 
our company has provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in various agreements with customers  suppliers and other parties  as well as in agreements to sell business assets or lease facilities 
in general  these provisions indemnify the counterparty for matters such as breaches of representations and warranties  certain environmental conditions and tax matters  and  in the context of sales of business assets  any liabilities arising prior to the closing of the transactions 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company

we do not believe that any of these commitments will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition

additionally  the guidance includes conforming amendments to employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosure of activity within level fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years 
the impact of adopting this guidance resulted in additional disclosures in note  postretirement plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the guidance affects the overall consolidation analysis and requires enhanced disclosures on involvement with variable interest entities vie 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  prior to fiscal  we consolidated a vie  as disclosed in note  variable interest entity  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k  because we determined the company was the primary beneficiary 
under this guidance  we have determined that the company no longer qualifies as the primary beneficiary and ceased consolidating the vie beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company will continue to record certain of the trucks and trailers the vie uses for distributing our products as right to use leases

in february  the fasb issued new guidance that amended certain recognition and disclosure requirements for subsequent events 
the guidance changed the requirement for public companies to report the date through which subsequent events were reviewed 
this guidance was effective at issuance 
the implementation of the standard and new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
information regarding non gaap financial measures the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
however  from time to time  the company may present in its public statements  press releases and sec filings  non gaap financial measures such as  ebitda and gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization to measure the performance of the company and its operating divisions 
ebitda is used as the primary performance measure in the company s annual executive bonus plan 
the company defines ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and income attributable to non controlling interest 
the company believes that ebitda is a useful tool for managing the operations of its business and is an indicator of the company s ability to incur and service indebtedness and generate free cash flow 
furthermore  pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  ebitda is used to determine the company s compliance with certain financial covenants 
the company also believes that ebitda measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because ebitda measures assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation or amortization  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and non operating factors such as historical cost 
ebitda is also a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to a income from operations or net income loss as a measure of operating performance  b cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s ability to meet its cash needs  or c any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with gaap 
our method of calculating ebitda may differ from the methods used by other companies  and  accordingly  our measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

interest rate risk the company has interest rate swaps with initial notional amounts of million and million  respectively  to fix the interest rate on the million term loan entered into on august  to fund the acquisitions of butterkrust and holsum

a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to quantify the company s potential exposure to interest rate risk with respect to the interest rate swaps 
as of january   a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of the interest rate swap by million 
the analysis disregards changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying debt  however  the company expects that any increase or decrease in payments under the interest rate swap would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in interest expense 
the cash effects of the company s commodity derivatives are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flow from operating activities
