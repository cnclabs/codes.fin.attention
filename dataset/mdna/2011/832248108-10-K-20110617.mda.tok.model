item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations derivative financial instruments for further information 
outbreaks of disease among or attributed to livestock can significantly affect production  the supply of raw materials  demand for our products and our business 
we take precautions to ensure that our livestock are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary manner 
nevertheless  we are subject to risks relating to our ability to maintain animal health and control diseases 
livestock health problems could adversely impact production  the supply of raw materials and consumer confidence in all of our operating segments 
from time to time  we have experienced outbreaks of certain livestock diseases and we may experience additional occurrences of disease in the future 
disease can reduce the number of offspring produced  hamper the growth of livestock to finished size  result in expensive vaccination programs and require in some cases the destruction of infected livestock  all of which could adversely affect our production or ability to sell or export our products 
adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products  particularly as we expand our branded pork products 
in addition to risks associated with maintaining the health of our livestock  any outbreak of disease elsewhere in the us or in other countries could reduce consumer confidence in the meat products affected by the particular disease  generate adverse publicity  depress market conditions for our hogs internationally and or domestically and result in the imposition of import or export restrictions 
outbreaks of disease among or attributed to livestock also may have indirect consequences that adversely affect our business 
for example  past outbreaks of avian influenza in various parts of the world reduced the global demand for poultry and thus created a temporary surplus of poultry both domestically and internationally 
this poultry surplus placed downward pressure on poultry prices which in turn reduced meat prices including pork both in the us and internationally 
any perceived or real health risks related to our products or the food industry generally or increased regulation could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally  including risks posed by the following food spoilage or food contamination  evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health related concerns  consumer product liability claims  product tampering  the possible unavailability and expense of product liability insurance  and the potential cost and disruption of a product recall 
adverse publicity concerning any perceived or real health risk associated with our products could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products  which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products  particularly as we expand our branded products business 
we could also be adversely affected by perceived or real health risks associated with similar products produced by others to the extent such risks cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of such products generally and  therefore  lead customers to opt for other meat options that are perceived as safe 
the a hn influenza outbreak that began in late fiscal illustrates the adverse impact that can result from perceived health risks associated with the products we sell 
although the cdc and other regulatory and scientific bodies indicated that people cannot get a hn influenza from eating cooked pork or pork products  the perception of some consumers that the disease could be transmitted in that manner was the apparent cause of the temporary decline in pork consumption in late fiscal and early fiscal our products are susceptible to contamination by disease producing organisms or pathogens  such as listeria monocytogenes  salmonella  campylobacter and generic e 
coli 
because these organisms and pathogens are generally found in the environment  there is a risk that one or more  as a result of food processing  could be present in our products 
we have systems in place designed to monitor food safety risks throughout all stages of our vertically integrated process 
however  we cannot assure you that such systems  even when working effectively  will eliminate the risks related to food safety 
these organisms and pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
in addition to the risks caused by our processing operations and the subsequent handling of the products  we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products 
we could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or adverse test results 
any product contamination also could subject us to product liability claims  adverse publicity and government scrutiny  investigation or intervention  resulting in increased costs and decreased sales as customers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products 
any of these events could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
our manufacturing facilities and products  including the processing  packaging  storage  distribution  advertising and labeling of our products  are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign laws and regulations in the food safety area  including constant government inspections and governmental food processing controls 
loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand  introducing new products  building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 
if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations  particularly if it relates to or compromises food safety  we could be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or asset seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  future material changes in food safety regulations could result in increased operating costs or could be required to be implemented on schedules that cannot be met without interruptions in our operations 
environmental regulation and related litigation and commitments could have a material adverse effect on us 
our past and present business operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment  including among others the treatment and discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposition of manure and solid wastes and the emission of greenhouse gases 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us  including administrative  civil and criminal penalties  liability for damages and negative publicity 
some requirements applicable to us may also be enforced by citizen groups or other third parties 
natural disasters  such as flooding and hurricanes  can cause the discharge of effluents or other waste into the environment  potentially resulting in our being subject to further liability claims and governmental regulation as has occurred in the past 
see item business regulation for further discussion of regulatory compliance as it relates to environmental risk 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations 
we also face the risk of lawsuits based on the law of nuisance even if we are operating in compliance with applicable regulations 
before we acquired psf and subsequent to our acquisition of psf  certain nuisance suits in missouri resulted in jury verdicts against psf 
currently  we are defending a number of additional nuisance suits with respect to farms in missouri 
see item legal proceedings missouri litigation 
although we are continuing psf vigorous defense of these claims  we cannot assure you that we will be successful  that additional nuisance claims will not arise in the future or that the accruals for this litigation will not have to be substantially increased 
in addition  we acquired psf in fiscal  which entered into environmental consent decrees in the state of missouri requiring psf to research  develop and implement new technologies to control wastewater  air and odor emissions from its missouri farms 
see item business regulation for further information regarding these obligations 
we cannot assure you that the costs of carrying out these obligations will not exceed previous estimates or that requirements applicable to us will not be altered in ways that will require us to incur significant additional costs and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  new environmental issues could arise that would cause currently unanticipated investigations  assessments or expenditures 
governmental authorities may take further action restricting our ability to produce and or sell livestock or adopt new regulations impacting our production or processing operations  which could adversely affect our business 
a number of states  including iowa and missouri  have adopted legislation that prohibits or restricts the ability of meat packers  or in some cases corporations generally  from owning livestock or engaging in farming 
in addition  congress has recently considered federal legislation that would ban meat packers from owning livestock 
we cannot assure you that such or similar legislation affecting our operations will not be adopted at the federal or state levels in the future 
such legislation  if adopted and applicable to our current operations and not successfully challenged or settled  could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our financial statements 
in fiscal  the state of north carolina enacted a permanent moratorium on the construction of new hog farms using the lagoon and sprayfield system 
the moratorium limits us from expanding our north carolina production operations 
this permanent moratorium replaced a year moratorium on the construction of hog farms with more than hogs or the expansion of existing large farms 
this moratorium may over time lead to increased competition for contract growers 
further  in june  the united states department of agriculture  grain inspection  packers and stockyards administration gipsa published a proposed rule adding new regulations under the packers and stockyards act psa 
if adopted as proposed  the new regulations appear to  among other things prohibit meat packers from purchasing livestock from other packers or their affiliates  eliminate the requirement that gipsa or livestock producers demonstrate competitive harm to prove violations of sections a and b of the psa  which sections limit unfair  unjustly discriminatory or deceptive practices and undue or unreasonable preferences or advantages in livestock purchasing practices  require meat packers to maintain written records justifying deviations from standard price or contract terms offered to livestock producers  and limit a packer ability to purchase livestock through dealers operating as packer buyers 
as an integrated hog producer and processor  these new regulations  if adopted  could significantly impact our relationships both with other meat packers to whom we sell livestock and with our independent contract growers from whom we buy livestock by prohibiting or restricting numerous practices that have been permitted for decades 
we cannot predict whether the proposed regulations or some modified regulations will be adopted or the extent of the effect of any such regulations on the meat processing industry or on our operations or financial results 
our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position 
as of may   we had approximately billion of indebtedness  guarantees of up to million for the financial obligations of certain unconsolidated joint ventures and hog farmers  guarantees of million for leases that were transferred to jbs in connection with the sale of smithfield beef  and aggregate borrowing capacity available under our abl credit facility as defined below totaling million  taking into account no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of million 
in june fiscal  we refinanced our asset based revolving credit agreement totaling billion that supported short term funding needs and letters of credit the abl credit facility into two separate facilities an inventory based revolving credit facility up to million  with an option to expand up to billion the inventory revolver  and an accounts receivable securitization facility up to million the securitization facility 
we may request working capital loans and letters of credit under both facilities 
our indebtedness may increase from time to time for various reasons  including fluctuations in operating results  working capital needs  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures 
in addition  due to the volatile nature of the commodities markets  we may have to borrow significant amounts to cover any margin calls under our risk management and hedging programs 
during fiscal  margin deposits posted by us ranged from million to million negative amounts representing margin deposits we have received from our brokers 
our consolidated indebtedness level could significantly affect our business because it may  together with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness  limit or impair our ability in the future to obtain financing  refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and materially impair our liquidity  a downgrade in our credit rating could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase the cost of future borrowings  it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise  a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes  which amount would increase if prevailing interest rates rise  substantially all of our assets in the united states secure the inventory revolver  the securitization facility  our million term loan due june  the rabobank term loan and our outstanding senior secured notes  which could limit our ability to dispose of such assets or utilize the proceeds of such dispositions and  upon an event of default under any such secured indebtedness  the lenders thereunder could foreclose upon our pledged assets  and it could make us more vulnerable to downturns in general economic or industry conditions or in our business 
further  our debt agreements restrict the payment of dividends to shareholders and  under certain circumstances  may limit additional borrowings  investments  the acquisition or disposition of assets  mergers and consolidations  transactions with affiliates  the creation of liens and the repayment of certain debt 
should market conditions deteriorate  or our operating results be depressed in the future  we may have to request amendments to our covenants and restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such relief should it be needed in the future 
a breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default that would permit our senior lenders  including lenders under the inventory revolver  the securitization facility  the rabobank term loan  the holders of our senior secured notes or the holders of our senior unsecured notes  as the case may be  to declare all amounts outstanding under the inventory revolver  the securitization facility  the rabobank term loan  the senior secured notes or the senior unsecured notes to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and the commitments of the relevant lenders to make further extensions of credit under the inventory revolver and the securitization facility could be terminated 
if we were unable to repay our secured indebtedness to our lenders  these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness  which could include substantially all of our assets 
our future ability to comply with financial covenants and other conditions  make scheduled payments of principal and interest  or refinance existing borrowings depends on future business performance that is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors  including the other risks set forth in this item a 
we may not be successful in implementing and executing on our hog production cost savings initiative 
in fiscal  we announced a plan to improve the cost structure and profitability of our domestic hog production operations 
the cost savings initiative includes a number of undertakings designed to improve operating efficiencies and productivity 
these consist of farm reconfigurations and conversions  and termination of certain high cost  third party hog grower contracts and breeding stock sourcing contracts  as well as a number of other cost reduction activities 
we can provide no assurance  however  that the cost savings initiative will result in the expected profitability improvement in our hog production segment 
our operations are subject to the risks associated with acquisitions and investments in joint ventures 
from time to time we review opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions 
we have also pursued and may in the future pursue strategic growth through investment in joint ventures 
these acquisitions and investments may involve large transactions or realignment of existing investments 
these transactions present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including diversion of management attention from other business concerns  difficulty with integrating businesses  operations  personnel and financial and other systems  lack of experience in operating in the geographical market of the acquired business  increased levels of debt potentially leading to associated reduction in ratings of our debt securities and adverse impact on our various financial ratios  the requirement that we periodically review the value at which we carry our investments in joint ventures  and  in the event we determine that the value at which we carry a joint venture investment has been impaired  the requirement to record a non cash impairment charge  which charge could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge  would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business  assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses  potential disputes with the sellers  and for our investments  potential lack of common business goals and strategies with  and cooperation of  our joint venture partners 
in addition  acquisitions outside the us may present unique difficulties and increase our exposure to those risks associated with international operations 
we could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems of which we are not aware or liabilities that exceed expectations 
our numerous equity investments in joint ventures  partnerships and other entities  both within and outside the us  are periodically involved in modifying and amending their credit facilities and loan agreements 
the ability of these entities to refinance or amend their facilities on a successful and satisfactory basis  and to comply with the covenants in their financing facilities  affects our assessment of the carrying value of any individual investment 
as of may   none of our equity investments represented more than of our total consolidated assets 
if we determine in the future that an investment is impaired  we would be required to record a non cash impairment charge  which could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge 
in addition  any such impairment charge would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future
