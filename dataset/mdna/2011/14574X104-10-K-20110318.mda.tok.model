we own and operate two hispanic restaurant brands  pollo tropical and taco cabana together referred to by us as our hispanic brands  which we acquired in and  respectively 
we are also the largest burger king franchisee  based on the number of restaurants  and have operated burger king restaurants since as of january   our company owned restaurants included pollo tropical restaurants and taco cabana restaurants  and we operated burger king restaurants under franchise agreements 
we are franchising our pollo tropical restaurants and as of january  we had franchised restaurants located in puerto rico  ecuador  honduras  trinidad  the bahamas and on college campuses in florida 
although we are not actively franchising our taco cabana restaurants  we had four taco cabana franchised restaurants at january  located in the united states 
we believe that the diversification and strength of our restaurant brands as well as the geographic dispersion of our restaurants provide us with stability and enhanced growth opportunities 
for the years ended december   and  we had total revenues of million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents the following is an overview of the key financial measures discussed in our results of operations restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales  net of discounts  at our company owned and operated restaurants 
restaurant sales are influenced by menu price increases  new restaurant openings  closures of restaurants and changes in comparable restaurant sales 
restaurants are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been open for months for our burger king restaurants and months for our pollo tropical and taco cabana restaurants 
for comparative purposes  the calculation of the changes in comparable restaurant sales is based on a week year 
was a week fiscal year 
for purposes of calculating the changes in comparable restaurant sales  we have excluded restaurant sales data for the extra week of cost of sales consists of food  paper and beverage costs including packaging costs  less purchase discounts 
cost of sales is generally influenced by changes in commodity costs  the sales mix of items sold and the effectiveness of our restaurant level controls to manage food and paper costs 
key commodities for our pollo tropical and taco cabana restaurants  including chicken and beef  are generally purchased under contracts for future periods up to one year 
restaurant wages and related expenses include all restaurant management and hourly productive labor costs  employer payroll taxes  restaurant level bonuses and related benefits 
payroll and related benefits are subject to inflation  including minimum wage increases and increased costs for health insurance  workers compensation insurance and state unemployment insurance 
restaurant rent expense includes base rent and contingent rent on our leases characterized as operating leases  reduced by the amortization of gains on sale leaseback transactions 
other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant level operating costs  the major components of which are royalty expenses for our burger king restaurants  utilities  repairs and maintenance  real estate taxes and credit card fees 
advertising expense includes all promotional expenses including television  radio  billboards and other media for our hispanic brand restaurants and advertising payments based on a percentage of sales as required under our franchise agreements for our burger king restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants  legal  auditing and other professional fees and stock based compensation expense 
adjusted segment ebitda  which is the measure of segment profit or loss used by our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance  is defined as earnings attributable to the applicable segment before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment and other lease charges  stock based compensation expense  other income and expense and gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt 
adjusted segment ebitda may not be necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation 
adjusted segment ebitda for our burger king restaurants includes general and administrative expenses related directly to the burger king segment as well as the expenses associated with administrative support to all three of our segments including executive management  information systems and certain accounting  legal and other administrative functions 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes the depreciation of fixed assets  including equipment  owned buildings and leasehold improvements utilized in our restaurants  depreciation of assets under lease financing obligations and the amortization of burger king franchise rights and franchise fees 
interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with the notes  borrowings under our senior credit facility  amortization of deferred financing costs and imputed interest expense on leases entered into in connection with sale leaseback transactions which are accounted for as lease financing obligations 
interest expense also includes any gains and losses from the settlement of lease financing obligations 
interest on borrowings under our senior credit facility is generally based on libor plus a current margin of or prime as we designate 
consequently  changes in libor rates or prime will impact our interest expense 

table of contents recent and future events affecting our results of operations spin off of hispanic brands on february  we announced our intention to pursue splitting our business into two separate  publicly traded companies through the tax free spin off of our hispanic brands to our stockholders 
the company to be spun off would operate our pollo tropical and taco cabana businesses 
carrols restaurant group would continue to own and operate our franchised burger king restaurants 
we are developing detailed plans for the proposed spin off 
the separation plan  including transaction structure  timing  composition of senior management and the boards of directors  capital structure and other matters  will be subject to approval by our board of directors  customary regulatory and other approvals and the receipt of a favorable irs tax ruling  among other things 
we believe that the separation will enable each company to better focus on its respective opportunities as well as to pursue its own distinct plan and growth strategy including acquisition opportunities in the burger king system 
we expect to complete the spin off by the end of  however there can be no assurance that we will complete the spin off by then or at all 
refinancing of outstanding indebtedness we are planning to undertake a refinancing of our existing debt and we plan to do so with a separate financing of the burger king and hispanic brand businesses 
our intent in bifurcating the financing is to facilitate the contemplated spin off of our hispanic brands at a later date  and avoid having to alter or reconstitute the capital structure at that time 
presently  our plan is to complete this refinancing in the middle of  however there can be no assurance that the refinancing will be completed within such time period  on favorable terms  or at all 
due to the interest rate terms in our existing senior credit facility it is likely that the refinancing will increase our interest expense in the aggregate 
future restaurant closures we evaluate the performance of our burger king restaurants on an ongoing basis including an assessment of the current and future operating results of the restaurant  and in relation to burger king franchise agreement renewals  the cost of required capital improvements 
we may elect to close restaurants based on such evaluation 
in  we closed seven burger king restaurants  not including restaurants relocated within the same market area 
we currently anticipate that we will close an additional ten burger king restaurants in  excluding any burger king restaurants which we may close and relocate 
we closed two underperforming taco cabana restaurants and two underperforming pollo tropical restaurant in we currently anticipate the closing of one taco cabana restaurant and one pollo tropical restaurant in we do not believe that the future impact on our consolidated results of operations from such restaurant closures will be material  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
our determination of whether to close restaurants in the future is subject to further evaluation and may change

we have not included obligations under our postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table as our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance  but is funded as retiree medical claims are paid 
also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers compensation  general liability and employee healthcare claims for which we pay all claims  subject to annual stop loss limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate 
the majority of our recorded liabilities related to self insured employee health and insurance plans represent estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
long term debt obligations 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for details of our long term debt 
capital lease and operating lease obligations 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for details of our capital lease and operating lease obligations 
lease financing obligations 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for details of our lease financing obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases  which are primarily for our restaurant properties and not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in food and paper costs  labor and other operating expenses and energy costs 
wages paid in our restaurants are impacted by changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates 
accordingly  changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates directly affect our labor costs 
we typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation  at least in part  through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in the significant accounting policies footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
sales recognition at our company owned and operated restaurants is straightforward as customers pay for products at the time of sale and inventory turns over very quickly 
payments to vendors for products sold in the 
table of contents restaurants are generally settled within days 
the earnings reporting process is covered by our system of internal controls and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments 
however  critical accounting estimates and judgments  as noted below  are inherent in the assessment and recording of accrued occupancy costs  insurance liabilities  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment  assessing impairment of long lived assets and lease accounting matters 
while we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could vary from these assumptions 
it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions 
accrued occupancy costs 
we make estimates of accrued occupancy costs pertaining to closed restaurant locations on an ongoing basis 
these estimates require assessment and continuous evaluation of a number of factors such as the remaining contractual period under our lease obligations  the amount of sublease income we are able to realize on a particular property and estimates of other costs such as property taxes 
differences between actual future events and prior estimates could result in adjustments to these accrued costs 
total accrued occupancy costs pertaining to closed restaurant locations was million at december  insurance liabilities 
we are insured for workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance claims under policies where we pay all claims  subject to annual stop loss limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate 
at december   we had million accrued for these insurance claims 
we record insurance liabilities based on historical and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and adjust accruals as warranted by changing circumstances 
since there are estimates and assumptions inherent in recording these insurance liabilities  including the ability to estimate the future development of incurred claims based on historical trends or the severity of the claims  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities 
income taxes 
we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
we are required to record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the value of estimated deferred tax assets are different from those recorded 
this would include making estimates and judgments on future taxable income  the consideration of feasible tax planning strategies and existing facts and circumstances 
when the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is expected to be different from that recorded  the asset balance and income statement would reflect any change in valuation in the period such determination is made 
evaluation of goodwill 
we must evaluate our recorded goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis 
we have elected to conduct our annual impairment review of goodwill assets at december our review at december  indicated there has been no impairment as of that date 
in reviewing goodwill for impairment  we compare the net book values of our reporting units to their estimated fair values 
in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units  we employ a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market based approach 
assumptions include our anticipated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital 
the results of these analyses are corroborated with other value indicators where available  such as comparable company earnings multiples 
this annual evaluation of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units including projections regarding future operating results and market values 
we had three reporting units with goodwill balances as of our most recent measurement date 
the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our respective reporting units by almost for our pollo tropical restaurants  more than for our taco cabana restaurants and more than for our burger king restaurants 
these estimates may differ from actual future events and if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets  principally property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we determine if there is impairment at the restaurant level by comparing undiscounted future cash flows from the related long lived assets to their respective carrying values 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining 
table of contents lease term  including sales trends  labor rates  commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
this process of assessing fair values requires the use of estimates and assumptions  including our ability to sell the related assets and market conditions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of burger king franchise rights 
we assess the potential impairment of burger king franchise rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we determine if there is impairment by comparing the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows from those acquired restaurants with the respective carrying value of franchise rights for each burger king acquisition 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of the acquired restaurants including sales trends  labor rates  commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions over their remaining franchise life 
if acquired franchise rights are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the franchise rights carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
lease accounting 
judgments made by management for our lease obligations include the length of the lease term  which includes the determination of renewal options that are reasonably assured 
the lease term can affect the classification of a lease as capital or operating for accounting purposes  the term over which related leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized  and any rent holidays and or changes in rental amounts for recognizing rent expense over the term of the lease 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
we also must evaluate sales of our restaurants which occur in sale leaseback transactions to determine the proper accounting for the proceeds of such sales either as a sale or a financing 
this evaluation requires certain judgments in determining whether or not clauses in the lease or any related agreements constitute continuing involvement 
for those sale leasebacks that are accounted for as financing transactions  we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate  or another rate in cases where the incremental borrowing rate is not appropriate to utilize  for purposes of determining interest expense and the resulting amortization of the lease financing obligation 
changes in the determination of the incremental borrowing rates or other rates utilized in connection with the accounting for lease financing transactions could have a significant effect on the interest expense and underlying balance of the lease financing obligations 
effects of new accounting standards there are currently no recent accounting pronouncements which had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of the date of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates  primarily limited to our senior credit facility 
at december   there were million of term loan a borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a per annum rate  at our option  of either the applicable margin ranging from to based on our senior leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility plus the greater of i the prime rate or ii the federal funds rate for that day plus  or 
table of contents adjusted libor plus the applicable margin percentage in effect ranging from to based on our senior leverage ratio 
a change in interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements have been negotiated in advance to minimize price volatility 
where possible  we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases that are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing 
however  long term increases in commodity prices may result in lower restaurant level operating margins
