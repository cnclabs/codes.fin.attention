as such  company restaurant sales decreased million in and million in as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in restaurant sales in both years is due primarily to decreases

distribution sales to jack in the box and qdoba franchisees grew million in and million in as compared with the prior year 
the growth in distribution sales in both years primarily reflects an increase in the number of franchise restaurants that purchase ingredients and supplies from our distribution centers  which contributed additional sales of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and were partially offset by lower psa volumes in higher commodity prices also contributed to the sales increase in

overall commodity costs increased approximately and at our jack in the box and qdoba company operated restaurants  respectively  including higher costs for beef  cheese  pork  dairy  eggs and shortening  partially offset by lower costs for poultry and bakery 
the decline in reflects a decrease in commodity costs at our jack in the box restaurants of including beef  shortening  poultry and bakery  margin improvement initiatives and selling price increases  which more than offset the impact of unfavorable product mix and promotions 
payroll and employee benefit costs were of company restaurant sales in  in and the decrease in reflects leverage from same store sales increases  lower insurance costs and the benefit of refranchising  which were partially offset by increases in unemployment taxes in several states in which we operate and higher levels of staffing designed to improve the guest experience at our jack in the box restaurants

occupancy and other costs were of company restaurant sales in and and in the percentage in reflects the leverage from same store sales increases  lower utilities expense and the benefit of refranchising 
these benefits were offset by higher costs associated with the rollout of new uniforms and menu boards at our jack in the box restaurants  higher psa depreciation expense related to the re image program at jack in the box and higher rent expense as a percentage of sales resulting from a greater proportion of company operated qdoba restaurants compared with fiscal the higher percentage in compared with is due primarily to sales deleverage and higher depreciation from the jack in the box re image program  which were partially offset by lower utilities expense

these increases were partially offset by the leverage provided from same store sales growth and higher franchise fee revenue

additionally  in  jack in the box advertising costs decreased due to lower psa sales at company operated restaurants  partially offset by incremental company contributions of approximately million 
the change in incentive compensation expense reflects an improvement in the company s results compared with performance goals in and a weakening in as compared with the previous year

the changes in market values had a negative impact of million in compared with a net benefit of million in and a negative impact of million in in  the decrease in pension and postretirement benefits expense principally relates to the curtailment of the company s qualified pension plan whereby participants will no longer accrue benefits after december  the increase in pension and postretirement benefits expense in primarily relates to a decrease in the discount rate as compared with qdoba general and administrative costs increased in and primarily due to higher overhead to support our growing number of company operated restaurants

the decision to close these restaurants was based on a comprehensive analysis that took into consideration levels of return on investment and other key operating performance metrics 
after consideration of the fiscal closure charge  impairment and other charges  net decreased an additional million in due primarily to declines in costs related to our restaurant re image and new logo program as this program nears completion and lower impairment charges for underperforming jack in the box restaurants as compared with gains on the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  net are detailed in the following table dollars in thousands number of restaurants sold to franchisees gains on the sale of company operated restaurants loss on expected sale of underperforming market gains on the sale of company operated restaurants  net average gain on restaurants sold gains were impacted by the number of restaurants sold and changes in average gains recognized  which relate to the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants

interest expense  net interest expense  net is comprised of the following in thousands interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million in and decreased million in the increase in is primarily attributable to an increase in the amortization of deferred finance fees related to the refinancing of our credit facility in and higher average borrowings  offset in part by lower average interest rates 
the decrease in is primarily due to lower average interest rates and borrowings  partially offset by a million loss on the early retirement of debt recorded in connection with the refinancing of our credit facility 

table of contents income taxes the income tax provisions reflect effective tax rates of   and of pretax earnings from continuing operations in   and  respectively 
the higher tax rate in is primarily due to the market performance of insurance investment products used to fund certain non qualified retirement plans 
the lower tax rate in is largely attributable to the impact of audit settlements  higher work opportunity tax credits and the market performance of insurance investment products 
changes in the cash value of the insurance products are not included in taxable income 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted share  in  million  or per diluted share  in  and million  or per diluted share  in we estimate that the extra rd week benefitted net earnings by approximately million  or per diluted share  in fiscal earnings from discontinued operations  net as described in the financial reporting section  quick stuff s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations 
in  the loss from discontinued operations  net was million  and included a loss from the sale of quick stuff of million  net of tax 
liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  the sale of jack in the box company operated restaurants to franchisees and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
our cash requirements consist principally of working capital  capital expenditures for new restaurant construction and restaurant renovations  income tax payments  debt service requirements  and obligations related to our benefit plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets  which results in a working capital deficit 
cash and cash equivalents increased slightly to million at october  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
during  cash flows provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of restaurants to franchisees  and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility were partially offset by 
table of contents repurchases of common stock and property and equipment expenditures

operating cash flows from continuing operations increased million in compared with due primarily to reductions in payments for the following advertising due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants million  income taxes million  property rent related to fluctuations in the timing of payments for the month of october million  pension contributions million and bonuses million 
the impact of these payment reductions were partially offset by a million decrease in net income adjusted for non cash items  a decrease in beverage incentives received resulting from a decline in the number of company operated restaurants million and a decrease in minimum rent receipts from franchisees attributable to the timing of collections for october rents million 
refer to the results of operations section of our md a for a discussion of factors leading to the decrease in cash net income 
in  cash flows from continuing operations decreased million compared with due primarily to the timing of working capital receipts and disbursements and a decrease in cash flows related to higher company restaurant costs  our refranchising strategy and same store sales declines at our jack in the box restaurants 
operating cash flows from our discontinued operations in and were not material to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
investing activities 
investing activity cash flows used in continuing operations increased million in compared with due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures  a decrease in proceeds from assets held for sale and leaseback and an increase in cash used to acquire qdoba franchise operated restaurants  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of restaurants to franchisees and collections of notes receivables related to prior years refranchising activity 
in  cash flows from continuing operations increased million compared with this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of sites that we sold and leased back and lower spending for purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by decreases in proceeds from and collections of notes receivable related to the sale of restaurants to franchisees

in  capital expenditures increased million compared with due primarily to higher spending associated with our jack in the box restaurant re image and new logo program  an increase in the number of new qdoba restaurants developed  an increase in the number of jack in the box restaurants rebuilt and the implementation of a new supply chain system 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in spending related to a decrease in the number of new jack in the box restaurants developed 
in  we substantially completed the re imaging of our company operated jack in the box restaurants 
in  capital expenditures decreased million due primarily to a decline in the number of new jack in the box and qdoba restaurants developed and the number of existing restaurants rebuilt  and lower spending related to our re image program and network and system upgrades 
in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
we plan to open approximately new jack in the box and new qdoba company operated restaurants in sale of company operated restaurants we have continued to expand franchise ownership in the jack in the box system primarily through the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees

for additional information related to ffe  refer to note  indebtedness and note  variable interest entities  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities decreased million in and increased million in as compared with the previous year 
in  the decrease is due primarily to higher debt payments in related to the refinancing of our credit facility  offset in part by cash used in to repurchase shares of our common stock and the change in our book overdraft 
the increase in primarily relates to repurchases of our common stock and the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in refinancing in  we replaced our then existing credit facility with our current credit facility intended to provide a more flexible capital structure 
in connection with the refinancing  borrowings under the term loan and million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to repay all borrowings under the prior credit facility and related transaction fees and expenses  including those associated with the new credit facility

as part of the credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
we may make voluntary prepayments of the loans under the revolving credit facility and term loan at any time without premium or penalty 
specific events  such as asset sales  certain issuances of debt and insurance and condemnation recoveries  may trigger a mandatory prepayment 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our credit facility  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments  stock repurchases  dividend payments and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios

as of october   ffe has borrowed million against this facility 
for additional information related to ffe  refer to note  indebtedness and note  variable interest entities  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under our credit facility  we consider interest rate swaps 
in august  we entered into two forward looking swaps that will effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan to a fixed rate basis beginning september through september based on the term loan s applicable margin of as of october   these agreements would have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of 
previously  we held two interest rate swaps that effectively converted million of our variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis from march to april  for additional information related to our interest rate swaps  refer to note  derivative instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents includes expected payments associated with our non qualified defined benefit plan  postretirement benefit plans and our non qualified deferred compensation plan through fiscal consists primarily of letters of credit for workers compensation and general liability insurance 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities 
the timing and amounts of future cash payments related to these liabilities are uncertain 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan qualified plan covering substantially all full time employees hired before january  our policy is to fund our qualified plan at amounts necessary to satisfy the minimum amount required by law  plus additional amounts as determined by management to improve the plan s funded status 
effective september  we amended our qualified plan whereby participants will no longer accrue benefits after december  as a result  our discretionary contributions will likely be lower in the future when compared with recent years 
contributions beyond fiscal will depend on pension asset performance  future interest rates  future tax law changes  and future changes in regulatory funding requirements 
based on the funding status of our qualified plan as of our last measurement date  we are not required to make a minimum contribution in for additional information related to our pension plans  refer to note  retirement plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
discussion of critical accounting estimates we have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review generally includes a restaurant level analysis  except when we are actively selling a group of restaurants  in which case we perform our impairment evaluations at the group level 
impairment evaluations for individual restaurants take into consideration a restaurant s operating cash flows  the period of time since a restaurant has been opened or remodeled  refranchising expectations  and the maturity of the related market 
impairment evaluations for a group of restaurants take into consideration the group s expected future cash flows and sales proceeds from bids received  if any  or fair market value based on  among other considerations  the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants 
if the assets of a restaurant or group of restaurants subject to our impairment evaluation are not recoverable based upon the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds fair value 
our estimates of cash flows used to assess impairment are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during fiscal year  impairment charges to write down certain assets to their estimated fair value were not material 
retirement benefits our defined benefit and other postretirement plans costs and liabilities are determined using several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  including assumptions about the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
our discount rate is set annually by us  with assistance from our actuaries  and is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a population of high quality bonds with a moody s or standard and poor s rating of aa or better meeting certain other criteria 
as of october   our discount rate was for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our expected long term rate of return on assets is determined taking into consideration our projected asset allocation and economic forecasts prepared with the assistance of our actuarial consultants 
as of october   our assumed expected long term rate of return was for our qualified defined benefit plan 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may affect the amount of pension expense we record 
a hypothetical basis 
table of contents point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our fiscal pension and postretirement plan expense 
we expect our pension and postretirement expense to increase million in fiscal principally due to a decrease in our discount rate from to and the market performance of the plan assets in the fourth quarter of self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation  general liability  automotive  and health benefits 
in estimating our self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analysis of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
restaurant closing costs restaurant closing costs consist of future lease commitments  net of anticipated sublease rentals and expected ancillary costs 
we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  at the date we cease using a property 
subsequent adjustments to the liability as a result of changes in estimates of sublease income or lease cancellations are recorded in the period incurred 
the estimates we make related to sublease income are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual sublease income due to changes in economic conditions  desirability of the sites and other factors 
share based compensation we offer share based compensation plans to attract  retain and motivate key officers  non employee directors and employees to work toward the financial success of the company 
share based compensation cost for our stock option grants is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
our goodwill impairment analysis includes a qualitative assessment 
if this assessment results in a less than likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  then no impairment is recognized and step two of the impairment test is not required 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of october  legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts  as we deem appropriate 
because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable  and unfavorable resolutions could occur  assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events 
as a result  the amount of ultimate loss may differ from those estimates 
income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  among other items  depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  allowable tax credits  effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
we adjust our effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which was issued to enhance comparability between entities that report under us gaap and ifrs  and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s equity 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption of the new guidance is permitted  and full retrospective application is required 
this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to risks relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates
