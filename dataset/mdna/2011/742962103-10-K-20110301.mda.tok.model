item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for more information regarding our capital ratios and the minimum regulatory guidelines 
source of strength 
under a longstanding policy of the frb  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to support them 
the frb takes the position that in implementing this policy  it may require a bank holding company to provide financial support to its subsidiaries at times it deems appropriate 
acquisitions and activities 
the bhc act requires prior frb approval for  among other things  the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or for a merger or consolidation of a bank holding company with another bank holding company 
with limited exceptions  the bhc act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries 
a bank holding company may  however  engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities that the frb has determined  by regulation or order  to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto  such as owning and operating a savings association  performing functions or activities that may be performed by a trust company  owning a mortgage company  or acting as an investment or financial advisor 
the frb  as a matter of policy  may require a bank holding company to be well capitalized at the time of filing an acquisition application and upon consummation of the acquisition 
the gramm leach bliley act allows bank holding companies that are in compliance with certain requirements to elect to become financial holding companies 
financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities than is otherwise permitted for bank holding companies 
at this time  privatebancorp has not elected to become a financial holding company 
redemptions 
under the bhc act  bank holding companies are required to provide the frb with prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of their outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months is equal to or more of their consolidated net worth 
the frb may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law  regulation  frb order  or any condition imposed by or written agreement with the frb 
this prior notice requirement does not apply to any bank holding company that meets certain well capitalized and well managed standards and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues 

table of contents under provisions of the treasury s troubled asset relief program s capital purchase program cpp as more fully discussed below under emergency economic stabilization act  banks who sold equity securities to the treasury under the cpp are generally prohibited  provided that such securities remain outstanding  from acquiring or redeeming their common  preferred or trust preferred securities for three years  without the consent of the treasury 
pursuant to our participation in the cpp  as discussed below  our ability to repurchase equity securities is restricted until january   subject to certain exceptions  unless we redeem the treasury s preferred stock investment prior to that time or otherwise obtain the treasury s approval 
tie in arrangements 
under the bhc act and frb regulations  we are prohibited from engaging in tie in arrangements in connection with an extension of credit  lease  or sale of property or furnishing of services 
accordingly  we may not condition a client s purchase of one of our services on the purchase of another service  except with respect to traditional banking products 
interstate banking and branching legislation 
under the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act  bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed are allowed to acquire banks across state lines subject to certain limitations 
states may prohibit interstate acquisitions of banks that have not been in existence for at least five years 
the frb is prohibited from approving an application for acquisition if the applicant controls more than of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide 
in addition  interstate acquisitions may also be subject to statewide concentration limits 
furthermore  under the interstate banking act  banks are permitted  under some circumstances  to merge with one another across state lines and thereby create a main bank with branches in separate states 
approval of interstate bank mergers is subject to certain conditions  including adequate capitalization  adequate management  cra compliance and deposit concentration limits  compliance with federal and state antitrust laws and compliance with applicable state consumer protection laws 
after establishing branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction  a bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal and state law 
ownership limitations 
under the federal change in bank control act  a person may be required to obtain the prior regulatory approval of the frb before acquiring the power to directly or indirectly control the management  operations or policies of privatebancorp or before acquiring control of or more of any class of our outstanding voting stock 
under the illinois banking act  any acquisition of privatebancorp stock that results in a change in control may require prior approval of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation 
dividends 
the frb has issued an updated policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies 
in the policy statement  the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company should inform the frb and should eliminate  defer or severely limit the payment of dividends if i the bank holding company s net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  ii the bank holding company s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or iii the bank holding company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
the policy statement also provides that the frb should be informed in advance prior to declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period eg  quarter for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure 
additionally  the frb possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends 
in light of the recent losses we have incurred  we provide notice to and obtain approval from the frb before declaring or paying any dividends 
in addition to the restrictions on dividends imposed by the frb  delaware law also places limitations on the ability of a corporation to pay dividends 
corporations may only pay dividends out of surplus or net profits in accordance with delaware law 
the ability of a holding company to pay dividends may also depend on the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries 
as a result of the losses incurred by our banking subsidiaries during  and  we did not receive any dividends from our banking subsidiaries during this period and we were dependent upon the capital maintained at the holding company level to pay dividends 
banks that participated in the treasury s cpp are also subject to dividend restrictions 
because of our participation in the cpp  prior to january   or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred  if earlier  we may not pay regular quarterly dividends on our common stock above per share without the treasury s consent 
in addition  we may not pay dividends on our common stock unless we have paid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock and nonvoting common stock 
bank regulation our subsidiary bank  the privatebank chicago  is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by various federal and state authorities 
additionally  as an affiliate of our subsidiary bank  privatebancorp is also subject  to some extent  to regulation by our 
table of contents subsidiary bank authorities 
the privatebank chicago is an illinois state chartered bank and as such  is subject to supervision and examination by the illinois department of financial and professional regulation and  as a frb non member bank  its primary federal regulator  the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the privatebank  na the privatebank wisconsin  a former bank subsidiary and a national bank  was merged with and into the privatebank chicago effective as of october  the former operations of the privatebank wisconsin are now regulated as part of the privatebank chicago 
regulatory approvals and enforcement 
federal and state laws require banks to seek approval by the appropriate federal or state banking agency or agencies for any merger and or consolidation by or with another depository institution  as well as for the establishment or relocation of any bank or branch office and  in some cases to engage in new activities or form subsidiaries 
federal and state statutes and regulations provide the appropriate bank regulatory agencies with great flexibility and powers to undertake enforcement actions against financial institutions  holding companies or persons regarded as institution affiliated parties 
possible enforcement actions range from the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to a cease and desist order  civil money penalties  receivership  conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance 
transactions with affiliates 
federal and state statutes place certain restrictions and limitations on transactions between banks and their affiliates  which include holding companies 
among other provisions  these laws place restrictions upon extensions of credit by an insured financial institution to the bank holding company and any non banking affiliates  the purchase by an insured financial institution of assets from affiliates  the issuance by an insured financial institution of guarantees  acceptances or letters of credit on behalf of affiliates  and investments by an insured financial institution in stock or other securities issued by affiliates or acceptance thereof as collateral for an extension of credit 
permissible activities  investments and other restrictions 
federal and state laws provide extensive limitations on the types of activities in which our subsidiary bank may engage and the types of investments they may make 
for example  banks are subject to restrictions with respect to engaging in securities activities  real estate development activities and insurance activities and may invest only in certain types and amounts of securities and may invest only up to certain dollar amount thresholds in their premises 
monetary policy 
our subsidiary bank is affected by the credit policies of the frb  which regulate the national supply of bank credit 
such regulation influences overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the frb s monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and this trend is likely to continue in the future 
dividends 
federal and state laws restrict and limit the dividends our subsidiary bank may pay 
under the illinois banking act  the privatebank chicago  while continuing to operate a banking business  may not pay dividends of an amount greater than its current net profits after deducting losses and bad debts 
for the purpose of determining the amount of dividends that an illinois bank may pay  bad debts are defined as debts upon which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of six months or more unless such debts are well secured and in the process of collection 
in addition to the foregoing  the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non capital standards established under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act of  as described below 
reserve requirements 
our subsidiary bank is subject to frb regulations requiring depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts 
effective as of december   the first million of a bank s transaction accounts subject to adjustments by the frb are exempt from the reserve requirements 
the frb regulations generally require reserves on a bank s transaction accounts totaling between million and million 
for transaction accounts totaling over million  frb regulations require reserves of million plus of the amount over million 
cross guaranty 
under the federal deposit insurance act  an insured institution that is commonly controlled with another insured institution shall generally be liable for losses incurred  or reasonably anticipated to be incurred  by the fdic in connection with the default of such commonly controlled insured institution  or for any assistance provided by the fdic to such commonly controlled institution  which is in danger of default 
standards for safety and soundness 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act of fdicia and the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  require the fdic  together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies  to prescribe standards of safety and soundness  by regulations or guidelines  relating generally to operations and management  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  stock valuation and compensation 

table of contents the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal stockholder 
in addition  the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted regulations that authorize  but do not require  the agencies to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying the safety and soundness guidelines to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the agency may seek to enforce its order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have also adopted guidelines for asset quality and earning standards 
state chartered banks may also be subject to state statutes  regulations and guidelines relating to safety and soundness  in addition the federal requirements 
capital requirements and prompt corrective action 
fdicia defines five capital levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
fdicia requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that fall below minimum capital standards and prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distribution that would cause it to be undercapitalized 
institutions that are not adequately capitalized may be subject to a variety of supervisory actions  including restrictions on growth  investment activities  capital distributions and affiliate transactions  and will be required to submit a capital restoration plan which  to be accepted by the regulators  must be guaranteed in part by any company having control of the institution for example  the company or a stockholder controlling the company 
in other respects  fdicia provides for enhanced supervisory authority  including greater authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for critically undercapitalized institutions 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and its implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  the agencies may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
state chartered banks may also be subject to similar supervisory actions by their respective state banking agencies 
insurance of deposit accounts 
under fdicia  as a fdic insured institution  our subsidiary bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk it poses to the deposit insurance fund the dif 
the fdic has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured deposits in order to achieve required ratios in the insurance fund and to impose special additional assessments 
to determine an institution s assessment rate  each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories using a two step process based on capital and supervisory information 
each insured institution is assigned to one of the following three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized 
each insured institution is then assigned one of three supervisory ratings a institutions with few minor weaknesses  b institutions which demonstrate weaknesses which  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to dif or c institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to dif unless effective corrective action is taken 
insured institutions classified as strongest by the fdic are subject to the lowest insurance rate  insured institutions classified as weakest by the fdic are subject to the highest insurance assessment rate 
in october  the fdic published a restoration plan to reestablish the dif to the statutory required minimum percentage of deposits  and has amended the plan from time to time thereafter 
as part of the restoration plan  the fdic increased risk based assessment rates 
in november  the fdic approved a final rule that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the prepaid assessments were recorded as a prepaid expense against which future quarterly assessments are applied 
in we paid million in deposit insurance prepayments through depending on our performance  any growth and other factors  this prepayment may be more or less than the aggregate insurance assessments through in february  the fdic approved final rules amending the deposit insurance assessment regulations 
the rules implement a provision in the dodd frank act that broadens the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on total assets less average tangible equity 
in addition to broadening the assessment base  the rules establish a separate risk based assessment system for large institutions with more than billion in assets and for other large  highly complex institutions 
prior to the rules taking effect  the rate for insured institutions are assessed based primarily on capital and supervisory information  including examination ratings and certain other factors as described above 
the rules eliminate the existing risk categories for large institutions and make the assessment rate a function of examination ratings  a performance component  which is designed to assess the institution s financial 
table of contents performance and ability to withstand stress  a loss severity component  which is designed to assess the level of potential loss in a failure scenario  and other factors and considerations 
under the rules  large institutions would be subject to different minimum and maximum total assessment rate ranges 
the ranges would be subject to certain adjustments by the fdic without further rulemaking 
the fdic intends for the new large bank pricing system to result in higher assessments for banks with high risk asset concentrations  less stable balance sheet liquidity  or potentially higher loss severity in the event of failure 
the rules take effect april  and will impact assessments beginning in the second quarter of pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act and the american recovery and reinvestment act of each as described more fully below  the maximum deposit insurance on qualifying accounts was increased from  to  until december  the dodd frank act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance on qualifying accounts to  deposit insurance may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
such terminations can only occur  if contested  following judicial review through the federal courts 
we do not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance for our subsidiary bank 
the dodd frank act raised the minimum reserve ratio of the dif from to of estimated insured deposits  which ratio is required to be attained by september   and eliminated the size limit of the dif 
the fdic is also required to offset the effect of restoring the dif to the required ratio by september  on institutions with less than billion in assets 
this may result in increased assessments on certain institutions with more than billion in assets 
see the supervision and regulation dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act section in item  business for additional information regarding the dodd frank act 
community reinvestment 
under the cra  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions  or limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
however  institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities 
performance is tested in three areas a lending  to evaluate the institution s lending performance  particularly to low and moderate income individuals and neighborhoods and small businesses in its assessment areas  b investment  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low income or moderate income individuals and small businesses  and c service  to evaluate the institution s delivery of products and services through its branches  and automated teller machines as well as its service to the community 
the cra requires each federal banking agency  in connection with its examination of a financial institution  to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution  including applications for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations  acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities  and savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
the cra also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the privatebank chicago was assigned a satisfactory rating at its most recent cra examinations 
anti money laundering ofac sanctions programs 
the bank secrecy act bsa  as amended by the usa patriot act of  imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing 
financial institutions are required to establish programs designed to implement bsa requirements that include verifying customer identification  reporting certain large cash transactions  responding to requests for information by law enforcement agencies  and monitoring  investigating and reporting suspicious transactions or activity 
the treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against entities such as targeted foreign countries  terrorists  international narcotics traffickers  and those engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
we are subject to these rules and have implemented policies  procedures and controls to comply with the aml regulations and the ofac sanctions programs 
compliance with consumer protection laws 
our bank is subject to many state and federal statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers  such as  cra  the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act and the home mortgage disclosure act 
real estate lending concentrations 
the fdic  occ and frb have issued guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 
the guidance focuses on institutions properly identifying whether they have a commercial real estate concentration and  if so  instituting the appropriate risk management procedures and increasing capital so that it is commensurate with the risk of having such a concentration 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses 
in december  the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interagency policy statement revising their previous policy on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll  which was issued in the policy statement was updated to ensure consistency with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and post supervisory guidance 
according to the revised policy statement  the alll represents one of the most significant estimates in an institution s financial statements and regulatory reports 
because of its significance  each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses 
the policy statement provides that to fulfill this responsibility  each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll is in accordance with us gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
consistent with long standing supervisory guidance  the policy states that institutions must maintain an alll at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio 
estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
arriving at an appropriate allowance involves a high degree of management judgment and results in a range of estimated losses 
emergency economic stabilization act on october   the us congress enacted the emergency economic stabilization act eesa 
eesa authorized the secretary of the treasury to purchase up to billion in troubled assets from qualifying financial institutions pursuant to the troubled asset relief program tarp 
on october   the treasury  pursuant to its authority under eesa  announced the cpp 
pursuant to the cpp  qualifying public financial institutions could issue senior preferred stock to the treasury in an amount not less than of risk weighted assets and not more than of risk weighted assets or billion  whichever is less 
the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock are included in the financial institution s tier capital 
the senior preferred stock pays a dividend per annum until the fifth year of the investment and per annum thereafter 
in addition to the senior preferred stock  participating public financial institutions must issue a warrant to the treasury for the purchase of common stock in an amount equal to of the preferred stock investment 
the treasury will not exercise any voting rights with respect to the common shares acquired through the exercise of the warrants 
financial institutions participating in the cpp must agree and comply with certain restrictions  including restrictions on redemption  dividends  repurchases and executive compensation  as discussed below 
finally  the treasury may unilaterally amend any provision of the cpp to comply with changes in applicable federal statutes 
redemption 
the terms of the cpp contained restrictions on the redemption of the treasury s preferred stock investment 
these restrictions on redemptions were modified on february   in connection with enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of discussed below 
dividends 
prior to the third anniversary of the investment or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred the financial institution may not increase common dividends beyond certain levels without the treasury s consent 
in addition  the financial institution may not pay dividends on common stock unless the financial institution has paid dividends on the preferred stock 
if the financial institution does not pay dividends on the senior preferred stock for six dividend periods  the treasury will have the right to elect two members to the board of directors 
repurchases 
prior to the third anniversary of the investment or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred  the financial institution may not repurchase other equity securities or trust preferred securities without the treasury s consent  except repurchases in the ordinary course related to employee benefit plans in a manner consistent with past practice  certain market making and related transactions by a broker dealer subsidiary of the financial institution  certain custodian or trustee transactions for another beneficial owner  or certain agreements pre dating participation in the cpp 
executive compensation 
participating financial institutions must modify certain senior executive compensation agreements consistent with eesa  which generally prohibits incentive compensation agreements that encourage senior executive officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks 
in addition  incentive compensation paid to senior executive officers must be recovered if such payments are subsequently determined to be based upon materially inaccurate financial results ie  a clawback provision 
participating financial institutions are prohibited from making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and are required to limit the federal tax deduction for compensation paid to senior executive officers to  for this purpose  senior executive officer means an individual who is one of the top five highly paid executives whose compensation is required to be disclosed pursuant to the exchange act 
as discussed below  these executive compensation restrictions were further expanded by the american recovery and reinvestment act of on january   privatebancorp closed a transaction with the treasury in order to participate in the cpp 
privatebancorp issued preferred stock to the treasury equal to million and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
table of contents 
as a result of the completion of two qualified equity offerings in pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds in excess of million  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant was reduced by from  to  shares 
pursuant to its participation in the cpp  privatebancorp is subject to the provisions therein 
american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of recovery act was signed into law 
included among the many provisions in the recovery act are restrictions affecting financial institutions who are participants in the tarp  which are set forth in the form of amendments to the eesa 
these amendments provide that during the period in which any obligation under the tarp remains outstanding other than obligations relating to outstanding warrants  tarp recipients are subject to appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance which were set forth in an interim final rule regarding tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance  issued by the treasury and effective on june  interim final rule 
among the executive compensation and corporate governance provisions included in the recovery act and the interim final rule are the following an incentive compensation clawback provision to cover senior executive officers defined in this instance and below to mean the named executive officers for whom compensation disclosure is provided in the company s proxy statement and the next most highly compensated employees  a prohibition on certain golden parachute payments to cover any payment related to a departure for any reason with limited exceptions made to any senior executive officer as defined above and the next five most highly compensated employees  a limitation on incentive compensation paid or accrued to the five most highly compensated employees of the financial institution  subject to limited exceptions for pre existing arrangements set forth in written employment contracts executed on or prior to february   and certain awards of restricted stock which may not exceed of annual compensation  are subject to a two year holding period and cannot be transferred until the treasury s preferred stock is redeemed in full  a requirement that the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer provide in annual securities filings  a written certification of compliance with the executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of the interim final rule  an obligation for the compensation committee of the board of directors to evaluate with the company s chief risk officer certain compensation plans to ensure that such plans do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risks or the manipulation of reported earnings  a requirement that companies adopt a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  a requirement that companies permit a separate  non binding shareholder vote to approve the compensation of executives  and a provision that allows the treasury to review compensation paid prior to enactment of the recovery act to senior executive officers and the next most highly compensated employees to determine whether any payments were inconsistent with the executive compensation restrictions of the eesa  as amended  tarp or otherwise contrary to the public interest 
in addition  companies who have issued preferred stock to the treasury under tarp are now permitted to redeem such investments at any time  subject to consultation with banking regulators 
upon such redemption  the warrants may be immediately liquidated by the treasury 
fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program in october  the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system 
the program was comprised of two voluntary components the transaction account guarantee program tagp and the debt guarantee program dgp 
transaction account guarantee program 
pursuant to the tagp  the fdic fully insured  without limit  qualifying transaction accounts held at qualifying depository institutions through december  qualifying transaction accounts included non interest bearing transaction accounts  interest on lawyers trust accounts ioltas and negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts with interest rates less than 
the fdic assessed a fee equal to basis points on transaction account deposit balances in excess of the  insured limit  which were subsequently increased to to basis points depending upon an institution s deposit insurance assessment risk category 
as provided by the dodd frank act  as discussed below  the fdic will insure the full balance of non interest bearing transaction accounts  including ioltas but not now accounts  through december   replacing the tagp at the end of beginning on january   non interest bearing transaction accounts will be insured under the fdic s general deposit insurance coverage rules 

table of contents debt guarantee program 
pursuant to the dgp  eligible entities were permitted to issue fdic guaranteed senior unsecured debt in an amount up to of the entity s senior unsecured debt outstanding as of september  privatebancorp has not issued any guaranteed debt under the dgp 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which significantly changes the financial regulatory landscape and will affect the operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies as well as others 
although many of the details of the dodd frank act and the full impact it will have on financial institutions and their holding companies are uncertain at this point  in part because many of the provisions require the adoption of implementing rules and regulations  changes mandated by the dodd frank act and the expected burden of compliance with the new law and its rules and regulations could increase operating costs and reduce revenues of financial institutions and their holding companies 
for example  the dodd frank act requires the adoption of new capital regulations by no later than january the regulations are required to be  at a minimum  as stringent as current capital and leverage requirements and may limit the use of subordinated debt or similar instruments to meet capital requirements 
the dodd frank act also provides that any trust preferred securities and certain hybrid securities issued on or after may  will be considered tier and not tier capital 
any trust preferred securities issued prior to may  by banks with assets of less than billion as of december  would continue to qualify as tier capital 
any trust preferred securities issued prior may  by banks with assets greater than billion as of december  will continue to qualify as tier capital until january  at that time  the treatment of the trust preferred securities as tier capital will be phased out over a three year period ending in january our currently outstanding trust preferred securities will be grandfathered for tier eligibility 
the dodd frank act also requires regulatory agencies to seek to make capital requirements for bank holding companies countercyclical  so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
certain financial institutions  including those of our size  will be required to conduct annual stress tests in accordance with regulations to be adopted 
although its impact on the implementing rules and regulations of the dodd frank act remain unclear  the us federal banking agencies have expressed support for recently issued proposals by the basel committee on banking supervision  commonly referred to as basel iii  that provide for heightened bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements that would be phased in over a multi year period 
basel iii provides for a minimum common equity risk based capital requirement  a tier risk based capital requirement and an total risk based capital requirement  an additional common equity capital conservation buffer and a periodic countercyclical capital buffer 
the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress 
the countercyclical buffer would be implemented according to national circumstances 
the basel iii proposals also include a non risk based leverage ratio  as a supplement to the capital requirements  and liquidity requirements 
the extent to which regulators in the united states adopt or incorporate provisions of basel iii in future legislation  including the implementing rules and regulations of the dodd frank act  remains unclear 
the dodd frank act permanently increases the deposit insurance limit to  per depositor and  effective july   repeals the prohibition on banks payment of interest on demand deposit accounts of commercial clients 
under the dodd frank act  the fdic will insure the full balance of non interest bearing transaction accounts through december   replacing the tagp at the end of the unlimited coverage provided under the dodd frank act applies only to non interest bearing transaction accounts  which are accounts where interest is neither accrued nor paid  depositors are permitted to make an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals and the bank does not reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended withdrawal 
unlike the coverage provided under tagp  now accounts are not eligible for unlimited deposit interest under the dodd frank act regardless of interest rate  even if no interest rate is paid on the account 
beginning on january   non interest bearing transaction accounts will be insured under the fdic s general deposit insurance coverage rules 
the dodd frank act broadens the assessment base for deposit insurance from one based on domestic deposits to one based on total assets less average tangible equity 
it also raises the minimum reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from to of estimated insured deposits  which ratio is required to be attained by september   and eliminates the size limit on the deposit insurance fund 
see the supervision and regulation bank regulation insurance of deposit accounts section in item  business for additional information 
in other provisions  the dodd frank act increases the regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions 
the regulations are expected to impose additional reporting and monitoring requirements  require higher capital and margin requirements and require that certain trades be executed through clearinghouses 
another significant aspect of the dodd frank act is the creation of a new bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws  which are currently handled by different federal authorities 
these agencies will continue their consumer protection functions until july   at which point these functions will be 
table of contents consolidated with the bureau 
the bureau will have broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
among other things  it is anticipated that the bureau may consider significant reforms in the mortgage industry

item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks  including those discussed below  which may affect the value of our securities 
the risks discussed below are those that we believe are the most significant risks affecting us and our business  although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
before making a decision to invest in our securities  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report 
risks related to our business we have significant credit risk related to our commercial real estate and construction loans 
at december   our commercial real estate and construction loans totaled billion and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of our total loan portfolio 
we had million in total nonperforming loans at december   compared to million at december   largely due to deterioration in our commercial real estate portfolio 
approximately and of nonperforming loans at december  and december   respectively  were commercial real estate or construction loans 
the real estate market continues to experience a variety of difficulties and challenging economic conditions 
in particular  market conditions in the chicago metropolitan area  in which we have a significant concentration of real estate collateral  showed minimal improvement during and remains stressed 
although certain commercial real estate assets such as multi family  office and retail have shown some signs of stabilization  the overall commercial real estate market remains depressed 
our commercial real estate and construction portfolios followed trends in the sector which included elevated commercial vacancy rates  sponsor bankruptcies  illiquid markets for real estate and downward pressure on real estate values and leasing rates 
our commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios include loans with large principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful leasing or sale of the property  the successful operation of the business occupying the property  the cost and time frame of constructing or improving a property and the availability of permanent financing 
the repayment of these loans is particularly influenced by general conditions in the real estate markets or in the local economy where the property is located 
many commercial real estate and construction loans do not fully amortize the balance over the loan period  but have balloon payments due at maturity 
the borrower s ability to make a balloon payment may depend on their ability to either refinance the loan or complete a timely sale of the underlying property 
the borrower s inability to use funds generated by a project to service a loan 
table of contents until a project is completed  and the more pronounced risk to interest rate movements and the real estate market that these borrowers face while a project is being completed or seeking a buyer  can also make construction loans more vulnerable to risk of default 
on a non owner occupied commercial property  if the cash flow from a borrower s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed  that borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
in the event of a default on a commercial real estate or construction loan  we may be required to foreclose on the real estate securing the loan 
the foreclosure process can be time consuming and costly 
further  once we foreclose on the real estate  we may be unable to sell the property in a cost effective or timely manner which may result in increased losses and carrying costs 
we had million in other real estate owned oreo at december   compared to million at december  if the economy generally  or the real estate market specifically  does not improve or experiences further deterioration  we may experience additional charge offs and provisions for loan losses and or increased oreo levels which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans  the repayment of which is largely dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower and the state of the economy 
the repayment of our commercial and industrial and owner occupied commercial real estate loans is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower 
if the economy remains weak for a prolonged period or experiences further deterioration or if the industry or market in which the borrower operates weakens  our borrowers may experience depressed or dramatic and sudden decreases in revenues that could hinder their ability to repay their loans 
our commercial and industrial loan portfolio  which includes owner occupied commercial real estate  totaled billion  or of our total loan portfolio  at december   compared to billion  or of our total loan portfolio  at december  unlike commercial real estate loans  or our owner occupied commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans are secured by different types of collateral related to the underlying business  such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
should a commercial and industrial loan require us to foreclose on the underlying collateral  the unique nature of the collateral may make it more difficult and costly to liquidate  thereby increasing the risk to us of not recovering the principal amount of the loan 
accordingly  our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected by defaults in this portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
lending money is a substantial part of our business 
every loan we make carries a certain risk of non payment 
this risk is affected by  among other things the credit risks posed by the particular borrower and loan type  changes in economic and industry conditions  the duration of the loan  in the case of a collateralized loan  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral  and the ability to identify potential repayment issues in loans at an early stage 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance is not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio and management s judgment 
the calculation of the allowance involves a great deal of judgment and uncertainty particularly given the current state of the economy and the real estate environment 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not incur losses on these loans greater than what we have provided for in the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to at december  our allowance as a percentage of total loans reflects a level based on management s analysis of the risk inherent in our loan portfolio 
although we believe our loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date  the allowance may not be adequate especially if economic conditions worsen or the factors used to calculate the allowance change 
our regulators also review the adequacy of our allowance and have authority to compel us to increase our allowance in current or future periods 

table of contents a large portion of our loan portfolio was originated since when we initiated a strategic plan to transform the bank into a leading middle market commercial bank 
the behavior of a portfolio of more mature loans may be more predictable based on past performance history than a newer portfolio  such as ours  because loans typically do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time 
as a result  the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will occur when the newer portion of the portfolio becomes more seasoned  which may be higher than current levels 
in calculating the allowance  we use historical default and loss information 
for those segments of our portfolio that are less seasoned  such as our commercial and industrial portfolio  the available historical default and loss data is more limited  making it more difficult to estimate the probable losses inherent in those portfolios 
in the event we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses  our credit losses exceed our allowance or we are required to take higher than anticipated charge offs in future periods  our earnings and our capital will also be adversely affected 
in addition  because a significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of larger credit relationships consistent with our commercial middle market strategy  we may have clients that expose us to significant concentrations of credit risk in one borrower or related obligors 
based on information we use to evaluate aggregate credit exposures to related borrowers for internal risk management purposes  we estimate that currently about one third of our total credit commitments including loans outstanding and unfunded commitments involve client relationships that have aggregate credit exposures greater than million 
at december   we had client relationships with aggregate credit exposures greater than million 
we may experience choppiness in our quarterly loan loss provision expense and charge offs if larger credits default  which may result in uneven credit quality trends 
depending on collateral values  the unexpected occurrence of an event or development adversely impacting one or more of our large clients could materially affect our results of operation and financial condition 
we may be unable to maintain capital at required or appropriate levels 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  we are subject to minimum capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies 
the current economic environment and the challenges facing many financial institutions  however  have resulted in heightened capital expectations from the federal banking agencies and the market particularly with respect to financial institutions experiencing credit challenges in their loan portfolios 
furthermore  recent legislative action such as the dodd frank act and the basel iii proposals could ultimately result in capital requirements that are more stringent than current requirements and expectations  although the ultimate outcome of these actions are currently unknown 
we currently manage our balance sheet to maintain capital ratios at levels above the minimum regulatory guidelines that we deem adequate for our risk profile and expect to manage growth within our existing capital base 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to maintain capital at these levels or at levels required or expected by our regulators or future legislation 
our capital position may be affected by further credit losses and credit deterioration  potential asset impairment  significant draws on our unfunded commitments  or unexpected asset growth 
see also risk factors if we are required to take charges related to asset impairments  including deferred tax valuation allowances and goodwill impairments  our results of operations and capital position may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to maintain capital at required or appropriate levels  we may be required to raise capital 
our ability to raise capital will be dependent upon our access to the capital markets and will be influenced by events  circumstances and risks that are specific to us and the banking industry  each of which may adversely affect our capital costs and the dilutive impact on our stockholders 
we may not be able to access sufficient and cost effective sources of liquidity 
we depend on access to a variety of funding sources to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients  including funding new loans and client draws on unused lines of credit 
as of december   we had a total of billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit 
currently  our primary sources of liquidity are client deposits  large institutional deposits  and wholesale market based borrowings  including brokered deposits 
in addition to on balance sheet liquidity and funding  we maintain access to various external sources of funding 
these external sources of funding include federal fund counterparty lines  repurchase agreements  the discount window at the federal reserve bank and the brokered deposit market 
our ability to access these external sources depends on availability in the market place and a number of factors such as counterparty relationship strength in the case of federal fund counterparty lines and repurchase agreements or the availability of loans eligible under the federal reserve s criteria eg  stipulations of documentation requirements  credit quality  payment status and other criteria in the case of the discount window at the federal reserve bank 
if our primary sources of liquidity are insufficient and we are unable to adequately access external sources  we may be required to increase our on balance sheet liquidity and funding by accessing the capital markets  which may not be cost effective or may have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 

table of contents commencing in and continuing throughout  we experienced a significant increase in client deposits 
this has allowed us to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding sources 
however  there can be no assurance that this level of client deposit growth will continue or remain at current levels or that we will be able to maintain the lower reliance on wholesale deposits 
as returns in the equity markets improve  when the economy improves  interest rates rise or as the types of accounts eligible for fdic insurance coverage are reduced  we expect some of our client deposits to move to other investment options  thus causing a reduction in our client deposits and increased reliance on wholesale or other funding sources 
in addition  because our deposit base is relatively concentrated given our core commercial banking strategy  the loss of large client relationships could negatively impact our liquidity 
at december   more than of our total deposits related to client relationships with greater than million in deposit balances 
our holding company s liquidity position is affected by the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand  payment of interest and dividends on debt and equity securities currently outstanding  debt service  capital we inject into our bank subsidiary and any redemption of debt 
our future liquidity position may be adversely affected if our bank experiences net losses  we deem it advisable or are required by our regulators to use cash at the holding company to support our bank subsidiary through additional capital contributions  we experience greater than anticipated outflows of client deposits  or we have difficulty raising cash through the issuance of debt or equity securities or accessing additional sources of funding 
given the losses we recorded in and  we are highly dependent upon the current cash position of the holding company to meet our liquidity needs and to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock for the foreseeable future 
if we need to limit future capital infusions to our banking subsidiary to manage holding company liquidity  we could become capital constrained at the bank which may restrict our asset growth 
this could adversely affect our results of operations 
the loss of key managing directors may adversely affect our operations 
we are a relationship driven organization 
our growth and development during the past three years have resulted in large part from the efforts of our managing directors who have primary contact with our clients and are extremely important in maintaining personalized relationships with our client base  which is a key aspect of our business strategy 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations if we are unable to replace these employees or we are unable to successfully retain the client relationships of a departing managing director 
to the extent weak financial performance  restrictions on compensation due to our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  limitations on available equity awards  or regulatory guidance impact our ability to offer competitive pay programs  we may not be successful in motivating and retaining key employees 
we are dependent upon our information processing systems to effectively conduct our business 
we rely heavily on communications  data processing and other information processing systems to conduct our business and support our day to day banking  investment  and trust activities  many of which are provided through third parties 
any failure or disruption in these products or services  including any failure or interruption resulting from a breach in security  could result in disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  risk management  or other systems 
we have policies and procedures expressly designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure  interruption  or security breach of our systems 
however  there can be no assurance that our policies  procedures and security efforts will be effective  or that any such failures  interruptions  or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that the impact will not be substantial  including damage to our reputation  a loss of customer business  additional regulatory scrutiny  or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure  systems  controls and personnel relative to our size and products and services  our ability to effectively operate our business may be impaired and our business could be adversely affected 
if we are required to take any charges related to asset impairments  including deferred tax valuation allowances and goodwill impairments  our results of operations and capital position may be adversely affected 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets and million of net deferred tax assets that arise because of differences in accounting treatment for financial and tax reporting purposes 
in assessing whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was needed  we considered a number of factors relevant to our judgment 
the evidence associated with our cumulative pre tax loss for financial statement purposes  measured on a trailing three year period  and the continuing challenging conditions in the commercial real estate sector were among the negative factors in our analysis 
positive evidence included our taxable income position for and  the expectation of reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods  and our other expectations 
our expectations for achieving future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  in amounts sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets are based in large part on the prospects for generating pre tax book income 
we relied on several factors in our judgment as to the quality and reliability of future pre tax book income 
these included our achievement of positive pre tax income results in recent quarters  the growth trends in pre tax  pre loan loss provision earnings during and  
table of contents the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio along with the declining balances of such loan segments 
we also considered the relative stability of credit trends in recent quarters 
we believe our capital position provides a level of confidence regarding our ability to absorb future credit losses without impairing longer term prospects for generating future pre tax book income and taxable income in amounts that more likely than not would be sufficient to support the realization of deferred tax assets 
based on our analysis of all the factors considered  we reached the conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will be realized in future tax periods 
our conclusion is dependent on a number of factors  including those described above 
to the extent these or certain other assumptions change materially  we may need to establish a valuation allowance against all or part of the net deferred tax asset  which would adversely affect our results of operations and capital levels and ratios 
in addition  even if we continue to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed for us gaap  we could be required to disallow all or a portion of the net deferred tax asset for bank regulatory purposes 
at december   we had a disallowed deferred tax asset for holding company consolidated regulatory purposes of million 
the assessment of whether the net deferred tax asset is disallowed  in whole or in part  for regulatory purposes whether on a holding company consolidated basis or a bank consolidated basis is based on regulatory guidelines  which in some cases  are more restrictive than those of us gaap 
although a disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory purposes does not impact our results of operations  it does reduce our regulatory capital ratios 
goodwill is an intangible asset and is subject to periodic impairment analysis 
certain facts or circumstances may indicate impairment that may lead us to recording an expense to write down this asset 
we had million in goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
our goodwill was created as a result of several acquisitions we completed in prior years 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
fair values of reporting units are determined using a combination of market based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available  and discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts 
our impairment determination would rely on assumptions critical to the process including discount rates  asset and liability growth rates  and other income and expense estimates 
if the impairment analysis of a reporting unit leads us to a conclusion that the book value exceeds its fair value and upon further analysis if the carrying fair value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  we would incur an impairment charge for some or all of our goodwill

for additional discussion of goodwill  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
risks related to our operating environment weak economic conditions could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
various segments of the us economy have been in a prolonged and deep slowdown over the past three years  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in each of our markets remains stressed and volatile 
continued and sustained periods of high unemployment or further deterioration in the national or local business or economic conditions could result in  among other things  a further deterioration of credit quality or a reduced demand for credit  including a resultant effect on our loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses 
these factors could result in higher delinquencies and additional charge offs in future periods  especially given our exposure to commercial real estate and construction lending 
such circumstances would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
continued sustained weakness in business and economic conditions generally  or in our markets specifically  could adversely impact our business through more clients and counterparties becoming delinquent  filing for protection under bankruptcy laws or defaulting on their loans or other obligations to us  a decrease in the value of the collateral underlying loans  requiring paydowns by our borrowers to remain in loan to value compliance or  alternatively  resulting in a default  a decrease in the value of any loans that we may hold for sale or property acquired upon default  lengthy holding periods required to liquidate property acquired upon default or loans held for sale  thereby increasing carrying costs and potentially impacting market values  and sluggish demand for loans and other products and services offered by us 

table of contents an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults in future periods could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provision for loan and covered asset losses  and valuation adjustments on any loans held for sale  which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
our operating results are largely dependent on our net interest income 
fluctuations in interest rates may significantly affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on earning assets  usually loans and investment securities  and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
we are unable to predict fluctuations in interest rates  which are affected by factors including monetary policy of the frb  actual inflation or deflation or expectations regarding the same  recession  unemployment rates  money supply  domestic and foreign events  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
the timing of any frb action to curtail or eliminate various stimulus related programs  as a result of inflation concerns or otherwise  could have an impact on interest rates in general and our net interest margin in particular 
our investment portfolio also contains interest rate sensitive instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates or spreads caused by governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  issuer or insurer credit deterioration and other factors beyond our control 
a rise in interest rates or spread widening would reduce the net unrealized gains currently reflected in our investment portfolio  offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested 
demand for the products or services of our capital markets group could be negatively impacted by interest rate changes and a decrease in sales volumes from this group could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
risks related to the financial services industry we are highly regulated and may be adversely affected by changes in banking laws  regulations  and regulatory practices 
we are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination 
this regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing consumer credit  and anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws  but also capital adequacy  asset quality and risk  management ability and performance  earnings  liquidity  and various other factors 
as part of this regulatory structure  we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
under this structure the regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine  among other things  that our operations are unsafe or unsound  fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies 
this supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct  growth and profitability of our operations 
any failure on our part to comply with current laws  regulations  other regulatory requirements or expectations or safe and sound banking practices or concerns about our financial condition  or any related regulatory sanctions or adverse actions against us  could increase our costs or restrict our ability to expand our business and result in damage to our reputation 
changes in laws  regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting the financial services industry  and the effects of such changes  are difficult to predict and may have unintended consequences 
new regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
these changes also can adversely affect borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
the impact of the recently enacted dodd frank act is still uncertain  is expected to increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs of doing business and could result in enhanced capital and leverage requirements and restrictions on certain products and services we offer 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which significantly changes the financial regulatory landscape and will affect the operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies as well as others 
although many of the details of the dodd frank act and the full impact it will have on our business or revenues are uncertain at this point  in part because many of the provisions require the adoption of implementing rules and regulations  the burden of compliance with the new law and its rules and regulations could increase operating costs and reduce revenue 
for example  the dodd frank act requires the adoption of new capital regulations by no later than january the regulations are required to be  at a minimum  as stringent as current capital and leverage requirements and may limit the use of subordinated debt or similar instruments to meet capital requirements 
future issuances of trust preferred securities have been disallowed as tier qualifying capital by the dodd frank act  although our currently outstanding trust preferred securities have been grandfathered for 
table of contents tier eligibility 
the dodd frank act also requires regulatory agencies to seek to make capital requirements for bank holding companies countercyclical  so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
the us federal banking agencies have also expressed support for recently issued proposals by the basel committee on banking supervision  commonly referred to as basel iii  that provide for heightened bank capital requirements that would be phased in over a multi year period 
to the extent the capital requirements under the dodd frank act are similar to the basel iii proposals  or otherwise impose heightened capital requirements  we could be required to raise additional capital depending on our business activities  asset mix  growth plans and results of operation 
the dodd frank act also provides that certain financial institutions of our size will be required to conduct annual stress tests in accordance with regulations to be adopted 
the testing will require resources and increase our compliance costs 
in other provisions  the dodd frank act increases the regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions 
this is expected to impact our capital markets group which offers an extensive range of over the counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives products to our clients 
the regulations are expected to impose additional reporting and monitoring requirements  all of which would likely result in added costs of doing business  require higher capital and margin requirements and require that certain trades be executed through clearinghouses 
depending on the outcome of regulatory implementation  the prospects for our capital markets business and the demand for its products may be diminished 
the dodd frank act repeals the prohibition on banks payment of interest on demand deposit accounts of commercial clients beginning one year from the date of enactment  and the market impact of this change is not yet known 
another significant aspect of the dodd frank act that will affect us is the creation of a new bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the bureau will have broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
among other things  it is anticipated that the bureau may consider significant reforms in the mortgage industry that could have an adverse affect on our mortgage business 
no assurance can be given as to the ultimate effect that the dodd frank act or any of its provisions will have on our business  financial condition and results of operations  the financial services industry or the economy 
our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program subjects us to certain restrictions 
on january   we issued approximately million of our senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
based on our participation in the cpp  we agreed to comply with its terms and conditions  which subjects us to certain restrictions  oversight  costs and compliance and reputational risks 
for example  we may not  without the consent of the treasury  increase our dividend  currently per share per quarter  above a rate of per quarter or  subject to certain exceptions  engage in repurchases of our common stock or trust preferred securities until january  or  if earlier  the date on which all preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred by the treasury 
our participation in the cpp also subjects us to additional executive compensation and other restrictions  which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified senior executive officers and other employees  particularly in light of the fact that some of the financial institutions with which we compete are not subject to the restrictions imposed by the cpp 
furthermore  under the terms of the securities purchase agreement we entered into with the treasury  the treasury will be able to unilaterally amend the agreement to make it consistent with any subsequent statutory provisions implemented by congress 
if we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the program or the securities purchase agreement  including any restrictions upon our use of the cpp proceeds  we could become subject to a regulatory enforcement action or legal proceedings brought by the us government  which  in turn  would present significant reputational risks for us that could affect our ability to retain or attract new clients or investors if and when we determine to raise additional capital or both 
we have counterparty risk  the creditworthiness of other financial institutions could expose us to losses on contracts we have with these institutions and could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our clients  specifically products and services relating to foreign exchange  derivatives and letters of credit 
our ability to provide certain products and service could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other banks 
banks are interrelated as a result of lending  clearing  correspondent  counterparty and other relationships 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more banks  or the banking industry generally  have in the past led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of the transactions engaged in by us in the ordinary course of business  particularly in our capital markets group  expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or customer 
in such instances  the collateral we hold may be insufficient to mitigate our losses  as we may be unable to realize or liquidate at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure 
such losses could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our capital markets group offers an extensive range of over the counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives products 
although we do not engage in any proprietary trading and we structure these client generated trading activities to mitigate our exposure to market risk  we remain exposed to various risks  the most significant of which include credit risk of our counterparties  operational risk and settlement risk  which may be most significant in foreign exchange transactions where timing differences between settlement centers can result in us paying our client and or counterparty before actually receiving the funds 
the exposure of our counterparties requires active monitoring as well as liquidity management to ensure timely and cost efficient posting of collateral 
operational risk includes errors in execution of internal bank procedures and controls  which could expose us to financial and or reputation loss 
a lapse or breakdown of these procedures or controls could significantly increase our exposure to counterparty credit risk and operational risk  which could result in a material loss to us 
our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry 
we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment 
we compete for loans  deposits  wealth management and other financial services in our geographic markets with other commercial banks  financial companies  thrifts  credit unions and brokerage firms operating in the markets we serve 
many of our competitors offer products and services that we do not or have greater resources and economies of scale to offer products and services that we offer more cost effectively 
certain of our competitors may have better name recognition and market presence that could benefit them in attracting business 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do or offer more favorable terms 
to be competitive  we will need to continue to invest in technology  infrastructure and human resources 
this investment is directed at enhancing our risk management function and generating new products and services  and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of our clients and regulators 
falling behind our competitors  who may have more extensive resources to invest  in any of these areas  could adversely affect our business 
we may be required in the future to pay higher fdic premiums or special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings 
fdic premiums and special assessments represent a significant cost for us 
during  we expensed total deposit insurance premiums of million 
in february  the fdic approved final rules that broaden the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets less tangible equity  establish a separate risk based assessment system for large institutions with more than billion in assets and increase the maximum assessment rates subject to further adjustment by the fdic 
although our current expectation is that the new rules will not have a significant impact on our assessments  there can be no assurance that the adoption of the new rules will not result in increased premiums 
further  if the actions taken by the fdic are insufficient to restore the insurance fund in a timely manner  or if additional bank failures further deplete the insurance fund  the fdic may require even higher premiums and impose additional special assessments in the future 
the fdic could also increase our premiums as a result of regulatory examination findings or conclusions

the following discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a comprehensive review of our operating results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto  and other financial information presented in this form k 
unless otherwise stated  all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis 
overview net income for was million  up from a net loss of million for we reported a net loss available to common stockholders for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted share  an improvement from a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
for  we reported net revenue growth of and a increase in operating profit from the prior year 
overall performance was driven by margin expansion  growth in core fee based products  and a favorable shift in the deposit mix  which reduced the cost of funds 
net interest income for increased from compared to  net interest income reflects the impact of downward deposit repricing and growth in earning assets 
net interest margin was for  up from in net interest margin continued to benefit from deposit repricing 
with the continued low rate environment  further opportunities to materially reduce cost of funds will likely be limited in for the year ended december   non interest income increased to million  up from million for non interest income growth reflects continued success in expanding client relationships 
treasury management income  up from  continues to be a strong area of non interest income growth 
wealth management income also increased over the prior year 
new loan originations drove growth in unused commitment  loan  and letter of credit fees 
mortgage banking income rose from  consistent with the broader industry trend of increased refinancing activity based on the low interest rate environment that prevailed over the past year 
exclusive of cva adjustments  capital markets income decreased year over year  reflecting the reduced client demand for interest rate derivatives 
net securities gains of million and million were included within non interest income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total expenses were impacted by higher workout related credit costs and increased compensation expense 
non interest expense for was million  compared to million for credit related expenses  which include net foreclosed property expense  loan and collection expense  and the provision for unfunded commitments  increased million from  primarily related to higher net foreclosed property expense due to an increase in other real estate owned oreo volume 
compensation expense was up million from the prior year  impacted by increases in commission based compensation and annual incentive compensation 
efforts to reshape our loan portfolio consistent with our commercial middle market strategy resulted in commercial loans representing of our total portfolio at december   diversified across industries  compared to at december  as a percentage of total loans  commercial real estate and construction loans were lower at december  compared to december  total loans were relatively flat year over year as the decrease in commercial real estate and construction loans during was offset by growth in commercial loans 
while some of our credit quality trends showed signs of stabilizing in  our credit quality continued to be impacted by the weak commercial real estate sector 
nonperforming assets were million at december   an increase of from december   due to an increase in oreo as accounts moved through the credit management process 
nonaccrual loans trended modestly lower in  decreasing million from the prior year 
nonperforming assets to total assets were at december   compared to at december  as we continue to work through the credit cycle  nonperforming asset levels may fluctuate due to the uneven timing over which these issues may emerge and the timing of dispositions or other remediation efforts 
we continue to pursue opportunities for loan and oreo sale transactions to resolve problem assets when appropriate 
despite ongoing workout 
table of contents efforts  our ability to meaningfully reduce nonperforming assets primarily depends on the broader economy s recovery and stabilization of the commercial real estate market 
for  the provision for loan loss  excluding covered loan provision  was million  down from million in the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was at december   compared to at december  net charge offs were million for  compared to million in the prior year

results of operations the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan and covered loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio s composition and performance  the identification of nonperforming loans  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from wealth management  capital markets product income  treasury management income  mortgage banking income  bank owned life insurance and fees for ancillary banking services 
net securities gains losses  if any  are also included in non interest income 
net interest income net interest income is the primary source of our revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest earning and other assets or activities 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates  including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  repricing frequencies  and the use of interest rate swaps and caps 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because non interest bearing sources of funds  principally non interest bearing demand deposits and equity  also support earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
our accounting and reporting policies conform to us gaap and general practice within the financial services industry 
for purposes of this discussion  net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component  such as interest rate spread and net interest margin  have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt securities to those on taxable interest earning assets 
although we believe that these non us gaap financial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance  these non us gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to us gaap 
the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income is presented in the following table 

table of contents table effect of tax equivalent adjustment amounts in thousands years ended december  change net interest income us gaap tax equivalent adjustment tax equivalent net interest income table provides average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for the three years ended december  the table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for and  including the tax equivalent yields on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
table below details variances in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and analyzes the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume and rate changes 
interest income and yields are presented on a tax equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of  which includes the tax equivalent adjustment as presented in table above 
compared to net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for was  an increase of basis points from in a higher volume of interest earning assets positively impacted interest income by million  while a decline in the average rate earned on covered assets and securities had a negative impact of million 
despite an increase of million on average nonaccrual loans from to  the yield on loans  excluding covered assets  improved basis points from the increase in loan yields reflects a change in loan mix more heavily weighted to higher yielding commercial loans than lower yielding commercial real estate loans 
lower short term interest rates and deposit repricing initiatives decreased interest expense by million  offset in part by higher interest rates paid on borrowings 
while total average interest bearing liabilities increased during  a favorable shift in the mix lowered the amount of higher cost funding and led to a million reduction in interest expense due to volume 
increases in net interest margin and interest income for include the benefit of a full year of higher interest earning assets from the mid fdic assisted acquisition  primarily in the form of covered assets 
covered asset accretion positively impacted net interest margin by and basis points for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest margin has been impacted by high liquidity on the balance sheet primarily held in low yielding cash deposits at the federal reserve 
we anticipate net interest margin is likely to continue to be impacted by the higher liquidity levels 
in addition  we do not anticipate meaningful continued benefit of the downward repricing of deposits to net interest margin 
we may see pressure on our net interest margin over the coming year if the rate environment remains low 
compared to net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for was  an increase of basis points from for the increase in net interest margin was due to a basis point decrease in the cost of funds  which was partially offset by a basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets year over year 
during  we re priced our interest bearing liabilities such that the level of reductions outpaced those on our interest earning assets 
net interest margin and interest income for included the benefit of higher interest earning assets from the mid fdic assisted acquisition  primarily in the form of covered assets

wealth management s fee revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the year ended december  wealth management s auma were billion at december   an increase from billion at december  the decrease in revenue year over year is due to lower asset values during the first half of  a higher allocation of assets to non fee producing cash equivalents  and an increase in lower fee producing client relationships during compared to other income  service charges  and fees increased million from to the increase was primarily due to fees related to increased product offerings such as syndication fees and increases in unused commitment and letters of credit fees 
non interest income in included net investment securities gains of million compared to  in the prior year 
the increase in securities gains was primarily due to sales of us treasury securities made during non interest expense an analysis of non interest expense is presented in the following table

see table  non us gaap measures  for a reconciliation of the effect of the tax equivalent adjustment 
compared to non interest expense increased million  or  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense  an increase in net foreclosed property and loan and collection expenses related to credit deterioration  and a higher provision for unfunded commitments 
compensation expense increased million  or  from and is largely attributable to higher annual incentive compensation  a higher level of average full time equivalents fte as a result of the fdic assisted transaction in mid  and increases in commission based compensation 
incentive compensation expense was higher in  as the prior year did not include any significant level of bonus expense due to the loss from continuing operations reported in net foreclosed property expense  which includes write downs on foreclosed properties  gains and losses on sales of foreclosed properties  and other expenses associated with the foreclosure process and maintenance of oreo  increased million from the increase in net foreclosed property expense is primarily due to maintenance and administration associated with a higher volume of oreo properties  coupled with higher valuation write downs in as compared to the prior year 
loan and collection expense increased million  or  from due to a higher volume of appraisals and legal costs incurred in connection with credit remediation efforts on our nonperforming loans 
we anticipate loan and collection costs to remain at an elevated level until nonperforming loans decline meaningfully 

table of contents other expenses increased million  or  from the prior year period 
other expenses include various categories such as bank charges  costs associated with the cdars product offering  education related costs  subscriptions  and miscellaneous losses and expenses 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and million in higher costs associated with the use of third party service providers as volumes increased due to the expanded client base 
insurance expense increased million  or  from excluding the million fdic special assessment in  deposit insurance premiums increased in due to the combined effect of a higher deposit base upon which fees are assessed  higher fee rates  and the additional basis point assessment paid on covered transaction accounts exceeding  under the transaction account guarantee program component of the temporary liquidity guarantee program tagp  which we elected to participate in through december  in february  the fdic adopted final rules relating to deposit insurance premiums 
although our current expectation is that the new rules will not have a significant impact on our assessments  there can be no assurance that the adoption of the new rules will not result in increased assessments 
the rules take effect april   and will impact assessments beginning in the second quarter of net occupancy expense increased million  or  from the increase in net occupancy expense from the prior year reflects  in additional facility rental expense  million in increased depreciation expense  and  in increased maintenance contract expense related to additional offices acquired in the fdic assisted transaction  as well as our increased office space 
professional services  which includes fees paid for legal  accounting  and consulting services  decreased million  or  from the decrease from the prior year period relates in part to non recurring expenses incurred one year ago in connection with the fdic assisted transaction and subsequent integration activities 
compared to non interest expense increased million  or  from to the increase represented continued investment in our strategic development during and a combined increase in salaries  net occupancy expense  technology costs  loan and collection expenses  and insurance costs 
the increase over the prior year was also due to the transaction integration costs attributable to the fdic assisted transaction in mid compensation expense increased million  or  during  due to the increase in ftes from to the increase in ftes was primarily associated with the addition of more than employees from the fdic assisted transaction in mid the increase was partially offset by a million net reduction in compensation paid under our annual cash incentive plan compared to full year due to the net loss in  the plan did not provide for incentive compensation payment to employees other than to associate managing directors  certain officers and staff 
the increase in occupancy expense during to million  compared to million in  reflected the investments we made in growing our office space to accommodate our larger downtown chicago team along with ten additional offices acquired as a result of the fdic assisted transaction 
technology and related costs increased to million in  compared to million in technology and related costs increased during due to increased operational costs and investment in technology to support our expanded products and services as a result of our growth and the fdic assisted transaction integration costs 
professional fees increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase was primarily due to costs associated with the execution of the fdic assisted transaction and subsequent integration activities 
insurance expense increased by million to million in  compared to million in the increase in insurance expense was primarily due to increased fdic insurance premiums caused by increased rates  special assessments totaling million in the second quarter  and a increase in deposit balances during loan and collection expense increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase was due to costs associated with nonperforming loan review  monitoring  and workout activity 
other expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the million increase was largely attributable to higher cdars fee expense correlated to the growth in this deposit category from the prior year  increased fees paid to third party service providers used on a recurring basis  and restructuring charges incurred during income taxes 
table of contents our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
an analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods through are presented in the following table 
table income tax provision analysis dollars in thousands years ended december  income loss before income tax provision income tax expense benefit effective income tax benefit rate n m the effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of federal income tax benefit rate of for pre tax loss periods principally due to state income taxes  the effects of earnings from tax exempt securities and bank owned life insurance  non deductible compensation and business expenses  tax credits and in  tax audit settlements 
the effective tax rate in is not meaningful because the small amount of pre tax income causes the permanent differences described above to disproportionately impact the effective tax rate compared to what would normally be expected 
the effective tax benefit rate was marginally greater in than in primarily because of the higher proportion of tax exempt income  relative to the loss before income taxes 
this was mitigated somewhat in by a proportionally higher amount of non deductible compensation 
realization of deferred tax assets net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
as a result of the pre tax losses incurred during and  we are in a cumulative pre tax loss position for financial statement purposes for the three year period ended december  this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  we have concluded that based on the weight provided by other positive evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
deferred tax assets at december  represent the aggregate of federal and state tax assets  although federal taxes represent the primary component of the balance 
taxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable income amounts provide sources from which deferred tax assets may be absorbed 
most significantly  however  we have relied on our ability to generate future federal taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  as the primary source from which deferred tax assets at december  will be absorbed 
in making the determination that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized  we considered negative evidence associated with the cumulative book loss position  our past performance in forecasting credit costs  as well as continued challenging conditions in the commercial real estate sector 
we have considered the positive evidence associated with a taxable income generated in and  b reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods  c the decline in the cumulative book loss during and our expectations regarding  d our success in achieving increasing levels of pre tax  pre loan loss provision earnings during and  a core source for future taxable income  e our reporting of pre tax profits in each of the past three quarters and five of the past eight quarters  f the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio during the past three years and the relative stability of credit trends in recent quarters  g our excess capital position relative to well capitalized regulatory standards and other industry benchmarks  and h no history of federal net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of the year federal net operating loss carryforward period 
in addition  we also considered both positive and negative evidence associated with the estimated timing of reversals of deferred deductible and deferred taxable items and the level of such net reversal amounts relative to taxable income run rate assumptions in future periods 
certain of the factors noted above support our expectation of generating future pre tax book earnings in future periods 
we believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels exclusive of reversing temporary differences that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets 

table of contents at december   the company had approximately million of deferred tax assets that relate to equity compensation awards that may not be fully realized  primarily due to a decline in the company s stock price since the awards were granted 
in such circumstances a valuation allowance is not recorded but when such awards vest  are exercised or expire  the company incurs tax charges because of the stock price shortfall 
during and such shortfall amounts totaled million and million  respectively  and in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance for share based compensation  were charged to stockholders equity because there was a sufficient level of excess tax benefits accumulated from prior years 
the company expects that the balance of prior year excess tax benefits may be reduced to in the future due to additional shortfall charges  in which case any future charges may need to be recorded to income tax expense  resulting in an increase in the company s effective tax rate 
the amount of such shortfall charges in future periods  the amount that may be charged to income tax expense and the timing of such charges cannot be reasonably estimated because it is largely dependent on changes in the company s stock price and other factors 
operating segments results we have three primary business segments banking  wealth management  and holding company activities 
the privatebank mortgage company results are included in the banking segment 
banking the profitability of our banking segment is primarily dependent on net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net income for the banking segment for the year ended december  was million  a million increase from net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income for the banking segment resulted primarily from a increase in net interest income and a increase in non interest income  offset by a increase in non interest expense 
net income for the banking segment for the year ended december  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  net interest income for the banking segment for the year ended december  increased to million from million in and million in total loans for the banking segment increased slightly to billion at december   compared to billion at december  commercial loans  including commercial and industrial and certain owner occupied commercial real estate loans  continued to be the fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio and increased to billion  or of our total loans  from billion  or of total loans at december  commercial real estate loans were of our total loans at december   compared to of total loans at december  total deposits increased by to billion at december  from billion at december  growth in non interest bearing demand deposits and money market deposits accounted for the majority of the deposit growth

lodestar investment counsel  llc  an investment management firm and partially owned subsidiary  is included in our wealth management segment 
we own a controlling interest in lodestar and management of lodestar owns the remaining interest 
net income attributable to controlling interests for wealth management increased to million for the year ended december   from million for  and up from million for the same period in the increase in net income from to is attributable to a increase in fee revenue  offset by a increase in non interest expense 
wealth management auma grew to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  wealth management s fee revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in fee revenue was attributable to larger auma over the course of than the prior years

fees paid to third party investment managers increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in the decrease from to was generally attributable to a decline in total assets managed by third party investment managers  with an increase in assets managed in mutual funds and exchange traded funds  as well as an increase in the portion of funds that are managed by fixed income managers rather than equity managers 
holding company activities the holding company activities segment consists of parent company only matters and intersegment eliminations 
the holding company s most significant assets are its net investments in its bank subsidiary and its mortgage subsidiary 
undistributed earnings 
table of contents relating to these investments are not included in the holding company financial results 
holding company financial results are represented primarily by interest expense on borrowings and operating expenses 
recurring operating expenses consist primarily of share based compensation and professional fees 
the holding company activities segment reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the same period in and a net loss of million for additional information about our operating segments are also discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
financial condition investment securities portfolio management we manage our investment portfolio with a goal of maximizing the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines  to meet pledging and liquidity requirements  and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to attempt to protect net interest income against the impact of changes in interest rates 
we may adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors  including expected liquidity needs  the current and forecasted interest rate environment  our actual and anticipated balance sheet growth rate  the relative value of various segments of the securities markets  and the broader economic environment 
investments are comprised of debt securities and to a small degree  non marketable equity investments 
our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of residential mortgage backed pools  collateralized mortgage obligations  us treasury and agency securities  and state and municipal securities 
all debt securities are classified as available for sale and may be sold as part of our asset liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on the securities available for sale represent the difference between the aggregated cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported  on an after tax basis  as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
this balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change  thereby affecting the aggregate fair value of the portfolio 
non marketable equity investments include fhlb stock and other various equity securities

portfolio composition outstanding loans  excluding covered assets  increased to billion at december   compared to billion at december   with new loans and advances on existing facilities offset by paydowns and payoffs of existing loans and charge offs 
loan growth during was relatively flat compared to the loan growth we experienced in  as a result of modest overall borrowing demand during and low line utilization rates resulting from higher levels of liquidity maintained by our commercial clients relative to historic periods 
loan growth was also impacted as we selectively focused on executing strategic opportunities within our existing capital base

commercial loans increased by million  or  to of total loans at december   compared to at december  commercial real estate and construction loans decreased by million in aggregate to of total loans at december   compared to at december  as we exited relationships and worked out problem loans concentrated in the commercial real estate category 

table of contents commercial loans increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the growth in commercial loans accounted for all the net loan growth within our loan portfolio during the year consistent with our commercial middle market strategy 
commercial real estate loans decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  the reduction in commercial real estate loans resulted from paydowns and payoffs of existing loans  charge offs  offset by the migration of loans previously reported in the construction category  as these loans progressed past the construction phase as certificates of occupancy were issued 
construction loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  residential construction decreased to million at december  as a result of lower residential construction volume and our continued efforts to reduce our residential development portfolio 
non residential construction loans decreased to million at december  due to the current construction downturn and the lifecycle migration of loans secured by construction projects to commercial real estate loans

the majority of our loans is not fully amortizing over the term of the loan and may become delinquent at maturity if the borrower is unable to obtain refinancing when  for example  the appraised value of the underlying collateral no longer supports the credit 
in recent quarters  the amount of in flows to nonperforming loans has exceeded delinquent loan levels  reflecting  in part  the fact that loans which cannot be renewed or repaid at maturity often become nonperforming before days past due 
all loans greater than days past due are nonperforming 
nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure proceedings and awaiting disposition oreo 
nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans that remain on nonaccrual  and  for periods prior to  loans past due days and accruing interest 
we specifically exclude certain restructured loans that accrue interest from our definition of nonperforming loans if the borrower has demonstrated the ability to meet the new terms of the restructuring as evidenced by a minimum of six months of performance in compliance with the restructured terms or if the borrower s performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time of the restructuring supports returning the loan to accruing status 
all loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest payments become days past due or earlier when management deems the collectability of the principal or interest to be in question rather than waiting until the loans become days past due 
once interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is reversed 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is only recorded on a cash basis after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal and or interest 
foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs at time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
on a periodic basis  the book values of these properties are adjusted based upon new appraisals and or market indications 
write downs are recorded for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
nonperforming assets  including nonaccrual loans  are presented in tables  and additional information on our oreo is presented in tables through as part of our ongoing risk management practices and in certain circumstances  we may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines 
in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate  extension of the maturity date  reductions in the principal balance  or other actions intended to minimize potential losses that would otherwise not be considered or improve our ultimate recovery on the loan 
concessionary modifications are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings 
restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual  moving to nonaccrual  or continuing on accrual status  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower 
we may utilize a multiple note structure as a workout alternative for certain loans 
the multiple note typically structures a troubled loan into two notes  where the first note is reasonably 
table of contents assured of repayment and performance according to the prudently modified terms and the portion of the troubled loan that is not reasonably assured of repayment is charged off 
troubled debt restructurings accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms  otherwise the restructured loan will remain on nonaccrual 
the composition of our restructured loans is presented in tables and total nonperforming assets increased by million from million at december  to million at december  during the year  total oreo increased million  reflecting the movement of several larger accounts to oreo  while total nonperforming loans decreased by during the year

nonperforming loan inflows result not only from delinquent payment trends but also from maturing loans for products in which exit financing at maturity is difficult such as the current market for commercial real estate refinancing 
commercial nonperforming loans increased by million  or  from december  a meaningful amount of the increase in commercial nonperforming loans was concentrated in two relationships 
commercial real estate nonperforming loans increased by million  or  from december   due to the continuing stress in this product sector and the lack of velocity in the market 
construction nonperforming loans decreased by million  or  from december  reflecting work out efforts and charge offs 
approximately of nonperforming loans at december  were commercial real estate and construction loans compared to at december  restructured loans accruing interest were million at december   compared to no restructured loans accruing interest at december  of the modified loans added during the year  were from three large credit relationships totaling million where management identified restructuring opportunities 
restructured loans accruing interest are not considered to be nonperforming assets 
we executed a number of transactions to reduce problem assets during we closed nonperforming loan and oreo sales totaling million and million  respectively  during as we look to dispose of nonperforming assets  our efforts and strategies may be impacted by a number of factors  including but not limited to  the pace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy  instability or lack of meaningful activity in the real estate market or higher levels of real estate coming into the market for sale

we do not necessarily expect to realize losses on these potential problem loans  but we do recognize these loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management 
although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans  they may never become nonperforming 
because many of the potential problem loans are commercial real estate related  a highly stressed loan sector  and because the potential problem loan population contains some larger sized credits  our total nonperforming assets may fluctuate over the next several quarters as we continue to execute remediation plans and work through the credit cycle 
potential problem loans as of december  are included in table 
table of contents the company has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a numerical rating of through loans rated and better ratings  inclusive are credits that exhibit acceptable financial performance  cash flow  and leverage 
if any risk exists  we attempt to mitigate by structure  collateral  monitoring  or other meaningful controls 
credits rated are considered special mention as these credits demonstrate potential weakness and that if left unresolved  may result in deterioration in the company s credit position and or the repayment prospects for the credit 
borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends  high leverage  tight liquidity or other credit concerns 
potential problem loans have a risk rating of and are considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor  the collateral pledged  or guarantors 
these loans generally have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved 
nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans risk rated or and have all the weaknesses inherent in a rated potential problem loan with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
special mention  potential problem and nonperforming loans are reviewed at minimum on a quarterly basis  while all other rated credits are reviewed as the situation warrants 
the following table presents the credit quality of our loan portfolio as of december   segmented by our transformational and legacy portfolios 
we aggregate loans by originating line of business for reserve purposes because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loans underwritten by the business units 
loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes in are considered legacy loans 
loans originated by a business unit that was established in connection with or following the business transformation plan are considered transformational loans 
renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans depending on the structure or defining characteristics of the new transaction 
the company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after  all new loan originations are considered transformational

the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance is not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward based on current and available information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired the specific component of the allowance  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified the general component of the allowance  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio and management s judgment 
the specific component of the allowance relates to impaired loans 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
all loans that are over days past due in principal or interest are by definition considered impaired and placed on nonaccrual status 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on  as applicable  the fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent  the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable fair value 
impaired loans exceeding  are evaluated individually while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of asset and product type 
if the estimated fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest  net of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premium or discount  impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses 
the recognition of any reserve required on new impaired loans is recorded in the same quarter in which the movement to nonaccrual occurred 
impaired loans with specific reserves are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve 
any impaired loan in which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made 
when collateral dependent real estate loans are determined to be impaired  updated appraisals are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally every six months 
in addition  both borrower and market specific factors are taken into consideration  which may result in obtaining more frequent appraisal updates or broker price opinions 
appraisals are typically conducted by third party independent appraisers under internal direction and engagement 
any appraisal with a value in excess of  is internally reviewed 
appraisals received with a value in excess of million may be sent to an outside technical review firm if appropriate 

table of contents both levels of review involve a scope appropriate for the complexity and risk associated with the loan and its collateral 
we consider other factors or recent developments which could adjust the valuations indicated in the appraisals or internal reviews 
as of december   the average appraisal age used in the impaired loan valuation process was approximately days 
the amount of impaired assets which  by policy  requires an independent appraisal  but does not have a current external appraisal at year end is not material to the overall reserve 
in situations such as this  we establish a probable impairment reserve for the account based on our experience in the related asset class and type 
the general component of the allowance is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio 
the methodology takes into account at a product level the originating line of business ie  the transformational or legacy status of the loan  the origination year  the risk rating migration of the note  and historical default and loss history of similar products 
using this information  the methodology produces a range of possible reserve amounts by product 
we consider the appropriate place within or outside these model ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the model that includes market and economic data and management judgment 
we also assess the general allocated component estimate in total and consider whether  based on management s judgment  any upwards or downwards adjustment is appropriate based on general and industry specific economic data  credit trends  information outside the model and other relevant indicators 
in our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance at december   we considered a number of factors for each product that included  but were not limited to  the following for the commercial portfolio  the pace of growth in the commercial loan sector  the growth of manufacturing activity  loss severity and default trends  for the commercial real estate portfolio  the potential impact of general commercial real estate trends  occupancy and leasing rate trends  the higher frequency of default in more recent years  charge off severity and collateral value deterioration  for the construction portfolio  the frequency of default  delinquency rates  industry experience on construction loan losses  construction spending rates  and employment rates in the construction industry  and for the residential  home equity  and personal portfolios  home price indices  sales volume  unemployment rates  vacancy rates  foreclosure rates  loan to value ratios  and delinquency rates 
the establishment of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment and includes a level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses actually occur 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including client performance  the economy  changes in interest rates and property values  and the interpretation by regulatory authorities of loan classifications 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately and consider this process to be an important credit management tool  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio 
at least quarterly  management with the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the allowance for loan losses and the underlying methodology 
as of december   management deemed the allowance for loan losses to be adequate ie  sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio  including those not yet identifiable 
as an integral part of their examination process  various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

continued high levels of charge offs reflect real estate collateral values  particularly land values  which have remained low

table of contents the following table presents our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates shown 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands as of december  of total allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total allowance general allocated reserve commercial commercial real estate construction residential real estate home equity personal total allocated specific reserve unallocated reserve total the allocated reserve for commercial real estate portfolio decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in this allocation is due in part to a lower amount of loans in the commercial real estate sector at december  as compared to december   as well as a significant level of commercial real estate related charge offs during the allocated reserve for our commercial loan portfolio has increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december   which is reflective of the growth in balances of this loan product type 
general allocated component of the allowance the general allocated component of the allowance decreased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the reduction in the general allocated reserve was primarily influenced by the improved risk profile of the performing portfolio during the year  the continued strategic shift away from commercial real estate exposure to commercial transactions  modest new loan growth  and the changing mix of the performing portfolio in which older legacy loans comprise a continually lower relative exposure in comparison to the total performing loans 
specific component of the allowance at december   the specific component of the allowance increased by million to million from million at december  the specific reserve requirements are primarily influenced by new loan additions to nonperforming status  as well as changes to collateral values 
our impaired loans are primarily collateral dependent with such loans totaling million of the total million in impaired loans at december  reserve for unfunded commitments in addition to the allowance for loan losses  we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities 
at december   our reserve for unfunded commitments was million  a million increase over million at december  net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
during  we refined our methodology to calculate our unfunded commitment reserves on unfunded commitments to more closely align with the method we use to calculate our general component of our allowance 
during  we also increased the reserve to account for one partially drawn letter of credit that was issued on behalf of an obligor where the collectability is in doubt 
these factors accounted for most of the increased unfunded commitment reserve during unfunded commitments  excluding covered assets  totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 

table of contents covered assets covered assets represent purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic as a result of the fdic assisted acquisition of the former founders banks from the fdic  whereby the fdic will reimburse us for the majority of future losses incurred on these assets existing at the date of acquisition 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic generally will assume of the first million of credit losses and of the credit losses in excess of million 
the carrying amounts of covered assets are presented in the following table table covered assets amounts in thousands december  december  commercial loans commercial real estate loans residential mortgage loans consumer installment and other loans foreclosed real estate assets in lieu estimated loss reimbursement by the fdic total covered assets allowance for covered loan losses net covered assets total covered assets decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the reduction is primarily attributable to million in principal paydowns  net of advances  as well as the resulting impact of such on the evaluation of expected cash flows and discount accretion levels 
in addition  the estimated loss reimbursement by the fdic the fdic indemnification receivable further contributed to the reduction as a result of loss claims paid by the fdic 
the allowance for covered loan losses increased by million to million at december  from million at december   reflecting a further credit deterioration in expected cash flows on certain pools of covered loans since the date of acquisition 
of the total increase in the allowance for covered loan losses  was offset through the fdic indemnification receivable and the remaining representing the non reimbursable portion of the loss share agreement recognized as a charge to provision for loan and covered loan losses on the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the fdic had reimbursed the company million in losses under the loss share agreements 
the following table presents covered loan delinquencies and nonperforming covered assets for the past two years and excludes purchased impaired loans which are accounted for on a pool basis 
since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows  the past due status of the pools  or that of individual loans within the pools  is not meaningful 
because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of loans  they are all considered to be performing 
these assets are excluded from the asset quality presentation of our originated loan portfolio  given the loss share indemnification from the fdic

we also have in place contingency funding plans designed to allow us to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding may be constrained 
as part of our asset liability management strategy  we utilize a variety of funding sources in an effort to optimize the balance of duration risk  cost  liquidity risk and contingency planning 
the bank s principal sources of funds are client deposits  including large institutional deposits  wholesale market based borrowings  capital contributions by the parent company  and cash from operations 
the bank s principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios  including loans  and to a lesser extent  our investment portfolio  which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk 
the primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends when received from its bank subsidiary  and proceeds from the issuance of senior  subordinated and convertible debt  as well as equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt  interest paid to our debt holders  dividends paid to stockholders  and subsidiary funding through capital contributions 
we consider client deposits our core funding source 
at december   of our total assets were funded by client deposits  compared to at december  we define client deposits as all deposits other than traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars 
time deposits are included as client deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
our client deposits are relatively concentrated given the nature of our business model  and we take this into account in managing our liquid asset levels 
liquid assets refer to cash on hand  federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral 
net liquid assets at the bank subsidiary were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we maintain liquidity sufficient to meet client liquidity needs  fund loan growth  selectively purchase securities and investments and opportunistically pay down wholesale funds 
while we first look toward internally generated deposits as our funding source  we utilize wholesale funding  including brokered deposits  as needed to enhance liquidity and to fund asset growth 
brokered deposits are deposits that are sourced from external and unrelated financial institutions by a third party 
this funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by the bank  but brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of long term funding 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits  excluding reciprocal cdars  to levels no more than of total deposits  and total brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
we do not expect these threshold limitations to limit our ability to grow 
net cash inflows provided by operations were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash outflows from investing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to million for prior year 
cash inflows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  were million  compared to billion in for additional information regarding our investment portfolio  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation investment securities portfolio

these deposits are classified as brokered deposits for regulatory deposit purposes  however  we classify a portion of cdars as client cdars due to the source being our existing and new client relationships and are  therefore  not traditional brokered deposits 
we also participate in a non client cdars program that is more like a traditional brokered deposit program in that our relationship is with the underlying depositor 
total deposits  net of traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars 
total deposits at december  increased from year end primarily due to growth in money market accounts and non interest bearing demand deposits  offset by reductions in interest bearing demand deposits  brokered deposits  and time deposits

brokered deposits  excluding client cdars  were of total deposits at december  and public balances  denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities  are included as a part of our total deposits 
we enter into specific agreements with certain public customers to pledge collateral  primarily securities  in support of the balances on account 
these relationships also provide numerous cross sell and business referral opportunities 
at december   we had public funds on account totaling million  of which less than were collateralized with securities 
year to year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates

over the past several years  our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short 
we expect short term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place for at least the near term 
in the event that time deposits are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank  we expect to replace those deposits with traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowed money or capital  or we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs

we replaced this funding with increased levels of client deposits 
during  the company participated in the frb s term auction facility taf  a temporary credit program made available to banking institutions as part of the us government s economic stabilization initiatives 
these borrowings were fully repaid by the bank during the second half of and the program itself was discontinued in in addition to on balance sheet liquidity and funding  the bank maintains access to various external sources of funding  which assist in the prudent management of funding costs  interest rate risk  and anticipated funding needs or other considerations 
some sources of funding are accessible same day while others require advance notice 
funds that are immediately accessible include federal fund counterparty lines  which are uncommitted lines of credit from other financial institutions  and the borrowing term is typically overnight 
federal fund lines fluctuate based on availability in the market place and counterparty relationship strength 
repurchase agreements or repos are also an immediate source of funding in which the bank pledges assets to a counterparty against which the bank can borrow with the agreement to repurchase at a specified date in the future 
repos can vary in term  from overnight to longer but are regarded as short term in nature 
an additional source of overnight funding is the discount window at the federal reserve bank 
the bank maintains access to the discount window by pledging loans as collateral to the federal reserve 
funding availability is primarily dictated by the amount of loans pledged by the bank  but also impacted by the margin applied to the loans by the federal 
table of contents reserve 
the amount of loans pledged to the federal reserve can fluctuate due to the availability of loans eligible under the federal reserve s criteria which include stipulations of documentation requirements  credit quality  payment status and other criteria 
the bank had unused overnight fed funds borrowings available for use of million at december  and million at december  our total availability of overnight fed fund borrowings is not a committed line of credit and is dependent upon lender availability 
at december   we also had million in borrowing capacity through the frb discount window s primary credit program  which includes federal term auction facilities  compared to billion at december  our borrowing capacity under this program  which we regard as a contingent funding source  changes each quarter subject to available collateral and frb discount factors 
the reduced availability at the frb discount window was predominately attributable to fewer loans meeting the frb pledging guidelines 
we continue to add eligible loans to the collateral pool and as of march  we had million in borrowing capacity 
long term debt which is comprised of junior subordinated debentures  million in a subordinated debt facility and the long term portion of fhlb advances  totaled million at december   decreasing million from million at december  the current year reduction is due to the movement of the current portion of fhlb advances from long term classification to short term 
the weighted average interest rate of long term fhlb advances at december  was compared to at december  over the past three years  we merged former bank subsidiaries that were member banks of the fhlb into the privatebank chicago 
the privatebank chicago is currently not a member bank and until it becomes a member  does not have access to additional fhlb borrowings 
advances prior to the bank mergers remain outstanding until maturity 
during there was no change in outstanding balances of junior subordinated debentures and the subordinated debt facility  totaling in aggregate million at year end and however  effective in the latter part of  the interest rate on million of junior subordinated debentures moved from fixed rate to variable in accordance with the original terms of the debentures  effectively reducing interest paid thereon from a weighted average at december  to a weighted average at december  refer to notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details regarding the junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt facility 
contractual obligations  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities through our normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
such obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances  as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial services provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process as all comparable loans we make

our purchase obligations include payments under  among other things  consulting  outsourcing  data  advertising  sponsorships  software license and telecommunications 
purchase obligations also includes the estimated cash severance amounts not prohibited under the executive compensation restrictions applicable to tarp cpp participants due to employees under employment contracts and arrangements  assuming an involuntary termination date of december  our commitments to fund civic and community investments  which represent future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low income housing  small business real estate  and historic tax credit projects that qualify for cra purposes  are not included in the contractual obligations table above 
the timing and amounts of these commitments are projected based upon the financing arrangements provided in each project s partnership or operating agreement  and could change due to variances in the construction schedule  project revisions  or the cancellation of the project 
as of december   the company had  of unrecognized tax benefits exclusive of net interest expense accruals that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized in future periods

table of contents capital issuances during  we did not have any common or preferred stock offerings 
the following is a summary of capital raising activities 
issuance of preferred stock in january  we sold  shares of a newly created class of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b to the treasury as part of the tarp cpp program 
we also issued to the treasury a ten year warrant to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock  or of the aggregate dollar amount of series b preferred shares purchased by the treasury  at an exercise price of per share 
in december as a result of the completion of the offerings  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant held by the treasury was reduced by from  to  shares 
the series b preferred stock and warrants qualify for regulatory tier capital and the preferred stock may be redeemed at any time subject to regulatory approval 
following a redemption of the preferred stock  the warrants may be liquidated by the treasury  through either a redemption at market prices or through a sale by the treasury to a third party 
the preferred stock has a dividend rate of for the first five years  increasing to thereafter 
among other things  we are subject to restrictions and conditions including those related to the payment of dividends on our common stock  share repurchases  executive compensation  and corporate governance 
we have deployed this new capital mainly to support prudent new lending in the markets we serve 
refer to emergency economic stabilization act eesa in supervision and regulation and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements of item and item  respectively  of this form k for additional discussion of the cpp and tarp programs 
issuance of common stock during  we undertook two common equity raises  in addition to converting existing preferred shares to common capital 
in may  we issued approximately million shares of newly issued common stock at a public offering price of per share 
we granted the underwriters an over allotment option to purchase an additional million shares which they partially exercised and purchased an additional  shares 
the net proceeds from the offering  including the partial exercise of the over allotment option  were approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions but before offering expenses 
in june  we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to create a new class of non voting common stock the non voting common stock  and amend and restate the certificate of designations of the company s series a junior nonvoting preferred stock the series a preferred stock to provide  among other things  that the shares of series a preferred stock are convertible only into shares of non voting common stock 
under the amended terms of the series a preferred stock  each share of series a preferred stock is convertible into one share of non voting common stock 
on june   we issued  shares of non voting common stock to gtcr upon notice of conversion by gtcr of all of its  shares of series a preferred stock 
this transaction resulted in a reclassification of preferred stock capital to common stock capital and did not increase total stockholders equity 
the shares of series a preferred stock held and converted by gtcr represented all of the authorized  issued and outstanding shares of series a preferred stock on such date 
we also entered into an amendment to our existing preemptive and registration rights agreement with gtcr pursuant to which we agree  among other things  to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the newly issued shares of non voting common stock for resale under the securities act of in november  we closed an underwritten public offering of common stock  which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  and issued a total of approximately million shares for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions 
of that amount  approximately million was purchased by certain funds managed by gtcr 
in addition  gtcr purchased approximately million of non voting common stock of the company  equating to million shares  through an exercise of its existing preemptive rights 
the net proceeds from both the public offerings  as well as from the sale of non voting common stock  qualify as tangible common equity and tier capital and are being used to further capitalize our subsidiary banks in order to support continued growth and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including possible fdic assisted acquisition transactions subject to satisfying eligibility requirements to participate in such transactions 
capital management under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  the company and the bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies 
these guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in the guidelines  including the leverage ratio which is tier capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets  and the tier capital ratio and the total capital ratio each as a percentage of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories 
these minimum ratios are shown in the table below 

table of contents to satisfy safety and soundness standards  banking institutions are expected to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet  regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activities and plans 
under our capital planning policy  we target capital ratios at levels we believe are appropriate based on such risk considerations  taking into account the current operating and economic environment  internal risk guidelines  and our strategic objectives as well as regulatory expectations 
at the bank  primarily due to our recent credit loss experience and levels of non performing loans  the current minimum capital requirements are ratios of tier leverage and total risk based capital 
our current plans are to continue to manage growth within our existing capital base and we do not currently have plans to raise additional capital in the near term

dividends we declared dividends of per common share during based on the closing stock price at december  of  the annualized dividend yield on our common stock was 
although we currently intend to continue to pay dividends on our common stock and our preferred stock at the current levels  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so 
as a result of our participation in the tarp cpp  we are subject to various restrictions on our ability to increase the cash dividends we pay on our common stock above the quarterly rate of per share  the rate in effect when our participation in tarp cpp began 
in light of the recent losses we have incurred  we provide notice to and obtain approval from the frb before declaring or paying any dividends 
for additional information regarding limitations and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends  refer to the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections 
the dividend payout ratio  which represents the percentage of dividends declared to stockholders to earnings per share  was for and for the dividend payout ratio has averaged approximately for the past five years 
stock repurchase program our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the applicable restrictions of the cpp following the sale of the preferred stock to the treasury under the tarp program 
please refer to eesa in supervision and regulation of item of this form k for additional discussion of the cpp and tarp programs 
in connection with restrictions on stock repurchases as part of the cpp  we terminated our repurchase program in february the restrictions on repurchases will not affect our ability to repurchase shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans  as such transactions are in the ordinary course and consistent with our past practice 
during  we repurchased  shares with a value of per share with all repurchases associated with shares submitted in satisfaction of taxes and or exercise price amounts in connection with the settlement of share based compensation awards 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
non us gaap measures this report contains both us gaap and us gaap based financial measures 
these non us gaap measures include net interest income  net interest margin  net revenue  operating profit  and efficiency ratio all on a fully taxable equivalent basis  tier common capital  tangible common equity to tangible assets  tangible equity to tangible assets  and tangible equity to risk weighted assets 
we believe that presenting these non us gaap financial measures will provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance  our business  and performance trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of others in the banking industry 
we use net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating various performance measures by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments assuming a tax rate 
management believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it enhances comparability to net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources  and accordingly believes that providing this measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes 
we also consider various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy  including tier common capital  tangible common equity ratio  tangible equity to tangible assets  and tangible equity to risk weighted assets  in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators 
these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes 
certain of these measures exclude the ending balances of goodwill and other intangibles and or 
table of contents preferred capital components 
because us gaap does not include capital ratio measures  we believe there are no comparable us gaap financial measures to these ratios 
we believe these non us gaap measures are relevant because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions 
additionally  presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capitalization to other companies 
however  because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios  our calculations may not be comparable with other companies  and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited 
non us gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied  and are not audited 
although these non us gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under us gaap 
as a result  we encourage readers to consider our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements of item of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes are the 
table of contents accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies  as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired the asset specific component  as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are not specifically identified the general allocated component  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio and management s judgment 
the asset specific component relates to impaired loans 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the loan s observable fair value  fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent  or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  impairment is recognized by creating a specific valuation reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses 
impaired loans exceeding a fixed dollar amount are evaluated individually  while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of asset and product type 
at the time a collateral dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired  we review the existing collateral appraisal 
if the most recent appraisal is greater than a year old  a new appraisal is obtained on the underlying collateral 
appraisals on impaired collateral dependent loans are reviewed as received and again at each succeeding six month interval 
if during the course of the six month review period there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral  a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan 
to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses  we aggregate loans by originating line of business for reserve purposes because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loans underwritten by the business units 
loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes in are considered legacy loans 
loans originated by a business unit that was established in connection with or following the business transformation plan are considered transformational loans 
renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans depending on the details of the individual note s structure or defining characteristics 
the company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after  all new loan originations are considered transformational 
the methodology produces an estimated range of potential loss exposure for the product types within our transformational and legacy loan portfolios 
we consider the appropriate place within or outside the ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the model that includes market and economic data and management judgment 
we also assess the general allocated component estimate in total and consider whether  based on management s judgment  any upwards or downwards adjustment is appropriate based on general and industry specific economic data and indicators 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses  which is a charge against earnings  is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that  in management s judgment is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 

table of contents goodwill is allocated to business segments at acquisition 
fair values of reporting units are determined using a combination of market based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available and discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
goodwill is not amortized but  instead  is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired  a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings 
such a charge would have no impact on tangible or regulatory capital 
the impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit 
in step one  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the impairment test continues step two by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill 
the adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying fair value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill impairment testing is considered a critical accounting estimate as estimates and assumptions are made about future performance and cash flows  as well as other prevailing market factors 
for our annual impairment testing  we engage an independent valuation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit as part of its impairment assessment 
in connection with obtaining an independent third party valuation  management provides certain information and assumptions that are utilized in the implied fair value calculation 
assumptions critical to the process include discount rates  asset and liability growth rates  and other income and expense estimates 
we provide the best information available at the time to estimate future performance for each reporting unit 
identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
all of the other intangible assets have finite lives which are amortized over varying periods not exceeding years and include core deposit premiums that use an accelerated method of amortization and client relationship intangibles and assembled workforce which are amortized on a straight line basis 
income taxes the determination of income tax expense or benefit  and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on a complex analyses of many factors  including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  current financial accounting standards  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences  assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferred deductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits  and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties 
we are subject to the federal income tax laws of the united states and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we periodically undergo examination by various governmental taxing authorities 
such authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  new interpretations of existing law or positions by federal or state taxing authorities  will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts  the impact of which could be significant to future results 
temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities  which are recorded on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely  based on a standard of more likely than not 
in making this assessment  we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through a the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  b future taxable income  c the possible application of future tax planning strategies  and d carryback to taxable income in prior years 
we have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets at december  however  there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we have concluded  as of december   that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized 
in the preparation of income tax returns  tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain 
we periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized 
the amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or 
table of contents owed including interest 
these estimates may change from time to time based on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return  such as tax authority audits  court decisions or other tax law interpretations 
there can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to cover tax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed 
at december   we had  of tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably affect the company s effective tax rate if recognized in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy and in accordance with our asset liability management policies  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
our asset liability management policies set standards within which we are expected to operate and include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  asset limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
our asset liability management policies also establish criteria by which we may purchase securities which include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
we attempt to structure our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within the guidelines set by our asset liability management policies and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
we have not used hedging activities as part of our asset liability management in recent years  but may pursue hedging strategies  as appropriate  to augment our risk management in the future 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our consolidated statements of income 
our primary method of estimating the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is through the use of a simulation model based on our interest earning asset and interest bearing liability portfolios  assuming the size of these portfolios remains constant throughout the twelve month measurement period 
the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then re price based on current terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
the following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of december  and december  analysis of net interest income sensitivity dollars in thousands immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change the estimated impact to our net interest income over a one year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change 
as an example  this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would increase by million or over a one year period  as compared to a net interest income increase of million or if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december  changes in the effect on net interest income at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the re pricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
interest rate sensitivity declined in compared to  except at basis points where sensitivity increased  as measured by the percent of change in interest income and in absolute dollar impact 
the decline is due to several factors including a general decline in interest rates which had the effect of triggering a greater proportion of loan floors  transforming previously floating loans into fixed rate loans with less interest sensitivity 
in addition  as the investment portfolio has become a greater percentage of our asset base with a longer duration than the loan portfolio  it has lowered overall sensitivity to interest rate risk within the asset portfolio 
further  growth within money market 
table of contents deposits and reductions in time deposits has resulted in a more rate sensitive liability portfolio  which offsets the sensitivity of the asset base 
the net result of these changes is a reduction in interest rate sensitivity 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  purchase or sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
