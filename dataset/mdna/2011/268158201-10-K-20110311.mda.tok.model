part i item business overview dynavax technologies corporation dynavax or the company  a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  discovers and develops novel products to prevent and treat infectious and inflammatory diseases 
our lead product candidate is heplisav tm  a phase investigational adult hepatitis b vaccine designed to provide rapid and superior protection with fewer doses than current licensed vaccines 
our pipeline of product candidates includes heplisav  clinical stage programs for our universal flu vaccine and hepatitis c and hepatitis b therapies  and preclinical programs partnered with glaxosmithkline gsk and astrazeneca 
we compete with pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and research organizations in developing therapies to prevent or treat infectious and inflammatory diseases 
our product candidates are based on the use of immunostimulatory and immunoregulatory sequences 
we were incorporated in california in august under the name double helix corporation  and we changed our name to dynavax technologies corporation in september we reincorporated in delaware in our principal offices are located at seventh street  suite  berkeley  california our telephone number is immunostimulatory sequences iss our proprietary technology platform includes iss  which are short dna sequences that enhance the ability of the immune system to fight disease 
iss activate the innate immune response by specifically targeting tlr  which is found on a specialized subset of immune cells 

table of contents iss work by changing or reprogramming the immune responses that cause disease rather than just treating the symptoms of the disease 
since tlr is found only in a specialized subset of dendritic cells  iss do not cause a generalized activation of the immune system and redirect the response of only those t cells involved in a given disease 
when linked to or combined with antigens  iss help generate memory th cells that can reprogram the immune system to induce long lasting therapeutic effects 
we have developed a number of proprietary iss compositions and formulations that make use of the different ways in which the innate immune system responds to iss 
depending on the indication for which iss is being explored as a therapy  we use iss in different ways 
iss linked to or combined with antigens for prevention of infectious diseases  iss can be linked to or combined with antigens to increase the visibility of the antigen and stimulate an immune response that will attack and destroy infected or abnormal cells 
this treatment induces a highly specific th immune response and generates memory t cells for long term protection 
this treatment has the potential to be used synergistically with other therapies 
iss alone for treatment of viral and respiratory diseases  iss can be used alone to modify the course of the disease by reprogramming the immune system 
iss suppress the th inflammatory response caused by any number of allergens to modify the underlying cause of inflammation as well as provide symptomatic relief 
advanced iss technologies for several programs  we use our advanced proprietary knowledge to design modifications of the molecular structure of iss to significantly increase their versatility and potency  allowing use of less iss 
these second generation iss stimulate specific immune responses  including potent interferon alpha induction 
immunoregulatory sequences irs our proprietary technology platform includes irs  which are short dna sequences that specifically inhibit tlrs associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
tlrs are key receptors of the innate immune system that can induce strong inflammatory responses 
in animal studies as well as in vitro  our tlr inhibitors have demonstrated broad potential in multiple autoimmune diseases models  such as lupus  inflammatory skin disorders  and rheumatoid arthritis

table of contents heplisav hepatitis b vaccine our lead product candidate is heplisav  a phase investigational adult hepatitis b vaccine designed to enhance protection more rapidly with fewer doses than current licensed vaccines 
our global strategy is to develop heplisav for adults who are at risk of hepatitis b infection  initially in populations that are less responsive to current licensed vaccines  including adults over years of age  individuals with chronic kidney disease  diabetics and others 
dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to heplisav  which is based on our proprietary iss that specifically target tlr to stimulate an innate immune response 
this vaccine combines our first generation iss with hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag manufactured in our dynavax europe facility in d sseldorf  germany 
heplisav is being evaluated in phase trials that are directed toward fulfilling licensure requirements in the united states  canada and europe 
the ongoing large scale phase lot to lot consistency and safety trial is expected to be completed in may  after a month follow up of these subjects 
enrollment for the phase trial in chronic kidney disease patients was completed in january there have been four safety assessments made by an independent data safety monitoring board  all of which have recommended the trials continue without protocol modification 
in february following completion of the fourth planned safety assessment  the dsmb determined that no other formal meetings of the dsmb are required 
clinical results over  individuals have been vaccinated with heplisav to date 
in the largest completed clinical trial  known as phast phase heplisav short regimen trial  heplisav met its primary endpoint 
the multi center phast trial evaluated more than  subjects from to years of age in canada and germany 
this phase trial evaluated a two dose regimen of heplisav administered at and month  compared to a three dose regimen of engerix b administered at   and months 
the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed protective antibody to hepatitis b after receiving a full course of vaccination 
immunogenicity results from this trial demonstrated that subjects receiving heplisav were seroprotected with fewer doses and at an earlier time point than subjects receiving engerix b 
results showed of subjects who received two doses of heplisav at and month developed protective antibody to hepatitis b by weeks  compared to of subjects who received three doses of engerix b at   and months at weeks 
data from this trial also demonstrate that subjects over years of age receiving two doses of heplisav over one month achieved a seroprotection rate of  compared to of subjects receiving doses of engerix b over six months 
overall safety results in the phast trial showed the profile of doses of heplisav appeared similar to doses of engerix b  with the exception that subjects who received heplisav had a higher risk of developing injection site swelling  redness  and pain compared to those who received engerix b 
the incidence of adverse events ae was for the heplisav group  compared to for the engerix b group 
the incidence of serious adverse events saes was for the heplisav group  compared to for the engerix b group 
there were two cases of systemic vasculitis reported as saes in this trial  a case of wegener s granulomatosis  or c anca vasculitis  in the heplisav group and a case of p anca systemic vasculitis in the engerix b group 
from march until september  the two investigational new drug ind applications for heplisav were placed on clinical hold by the us food and drug administration the fda following the wegener s granulomatosis sae that occurred in the heplisav group of the phast trial 
in september  the fda removed the clinical hold on the ind application for individuals with chronic kidney disease 
in october  we reported that heplisav given as two doses over four weeks demonstrated superior seroprotection in persons with diabetes mellitus compared to engerix b given as three doses over weeks 
the subset analysis of adults with diabetes in our previously reported phast phase multicenter study showed 
table of contents that at weeks  of adult diabetics treated with heplisav achieved seroprotection as compared to of adult diabetics treated with engerix b 
at week  of the heplisav treated group versus in the engerix b group achieved seroprotection 
heplisav s significantly higher rate of seroprotection was achieved without further immunization past four weeks while the engerix b group received a third immunization at weeks 
commercial opportunity hepatitis b is a chronic disease which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma 
there is no cure for hepatitis b and disease prevention through effective vaccines is critical to reducing the spread of the disease 
available hepatitis b vaccines for adults have several limitations  including slow onset of protection the current regimen for adults is usually doses given over months to provide seroprotection of approximately   and after the first  second  and third doses respectively  poor protection in populations that are low responders current vaccines provide less seroprotection to persons over years of age and to immunocompromised persons  such as end stage renal disease esrd patients  and poor compliance in certain settings only of people receive all doses 
heplisav is designed to address the limitations of current vaccines by providing rapid and superior protection with fewer doses than currently licensed vaccines 
we estimate the current worldwide market for adult monovalent hepatitis b vaccines exceeds million annually 
this market is primarily comprised of gsk s engerix b and merck s recombivax hb 
over an estimated million in additional sales are generated by gsk s combined hepatitis a hepatitis b vaccine  twinrix 
key market segments include chronic kidney disease ckd patients  healthcare workers and first responders  travelers  people with multiple sexual partners or injection drug use  and chronic liver disease patients 
heplisav is being developed initially for patients less responsive to current licensed vaccines  including patients over years of age  individuals with ckd  hiv  and chronic liver disease 
the ckd market is large  growing rapidly  and is recommended for vaccination 
in  there were approximately  esrd patients in the united states and major european markets and approximately  new patients are added annually 
because these patients typically do not respond well to current vaccines  a typical regimen calls for doses of engerix b versus doses in the general population 
even with this regimen  approximately of these immunocompromised esrd patients do not respond to vaccination and approximately require boosters 
as vaccination for these patients occurs regularly at dialysis centers  this is a concentrated  renewable market that can be served by cost effective  targeted sales distribution networks 
in addition to the ckd market  we believe that the potentially differentiating characteristics of heplisav can address key unmet needs in adult hepatitis b vaccination  and may provide an opportunity for growth in under served market segments such as hiv and chronic liver disease 
the hiv positive market segment shares similar characteristics to the esrd market 
vaccination is critical due to substantially increased morbidity and mortality from co infection with hiv and hbv and similar modes of transmission 
because these patients typically do not respond well to current vaccines  aggressive vaccination regimens and boosters are common 
there are approximately two million adults living with hiv in the united states and europe  with approximately  new cases annually 
chronic liver disease can be caused by hepatitis c infection  alcohol or genetics 
these patients are also recommended for vaccination  but vaccine coverage rates are low  representing a future opportunity for hepatitis b vaccines to grow 

table of contents we also believe that the profile of heplisav has potential benefits for individuals who need rapid protection against hepatitis b  including healthcare workers  first responders  travelers and diabetics because heplisav provides higher levels of protection following days of treatment compared to months for current licensed vaccines 
universal flu vaccine our universal flu vaccine is designed to offer protection against divergent strains as well as increase the efficacy and potentially reduce the antigen content of standard flu vaccines 
this unique approach is based on our proprietary component n  which is a fusion protein comprised of two highly conserved influenza antigens  nucleoprotein np and matrix protein me  covalently linked to proprietary second generation tlr agonist 
n is then combined with a conventional flu vaccine conventional flu vaccines currently available flu vaccines typically contain antigens of three flu viruses two influenza a subtypes and one influenza b subtype 
the exact composition changes every year and is determined by the world health organization who and fda based upon surveillance and estimates of which types and strains of viruses are likely to circulate 
the goal of existing vaccines is to induce the development of antibodies to provide protection against influenza infection 
our proprietary component could be combined with any flu vaccine  including standard trivalent influenza vaccine tiv and vaccines for emerging strains such as hn or hn two highly conserved antigens  np and me  are expected to offer protection against divergent influenza strains our universal flu vaccine includes two conserved antigens  np and me  which are present in all flu strains 
np  or nucleoprotein  is highly conserved across human and animal strains  while me  the extracellular domain of the matrix protein  is conserved but with some variations among species 
np induces cytotoxic t cell protection and me induces antibodies that may provide protection against divergent strains 
our proprietary second generation tlr agonist may enhance efficacy and enable antigen sparing  which could extend the quantity of standard flu vaccine available 
dynavax has established a worldwide supply and option agreement with novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc  under which novartis is supplying trivalent influenza vaccine  an essential component of our universal flu vaccine 
clinical results in early december  we reported safety and immunogenicity data from our phase a clinical trial of n the trial assessed three dose levels of n in a total study population of subjects 
the phase a data showed that all doses were safe and generally well tolerated 
there were no dose limiting toxicities  subjects demonstrated positive antibody responses to me and np  and positive t cell mediated responses to np were seen 
based on preliminary safety data for the phase a trial  we initiated a phase b study in september to evaluate the safety of the combination of n and an investigational hn avian influenza vaccine 
the phase b study evaluated subjects  including from the phase a dose escalation study of n and from the phase b dose escalation study of hn n data from the phase a and the phase b study reported at the world health organization th meeting on evaluation of pandemic influenza prototype vaccines in february showed n alone or combined with hn vaccine was very safe and generally well tolerated  the most common adverse events were mild  self limited injection site reactions  there were no saes  all n dose groups had an antibody response to me  and the placebo group did not  all n dose groups had an antibody response to np  and the placebo group did not  
table of contents all n dose groups had a cellular immune response to np  and the placebo group did not  the addition of n to a non immunogenic dose of hn vaccine resulted in h responses in all n dose groups 
commercial opportunity human viral influenza is an acute respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality that occurs in annual epidemics worldwide 
there are an estimated  to  viral influenza associated deaths per year in the united states  primarily in those over years of age 
influenza pandemics occur infrequently  on average every to years  but it is estimated that the next pandemic could result in millions of deaths worldwide 
analysts estimate the current worldwide market opportunity for seasonal influenza vaccines to be approximately billion annually 
standard flu vaccines can provide protection against the flu strains predicted to be prevalent during a season 
the efficacy of these vaccines is often decreased by unpredictable changes in the actual strains causing influenza 
current vaccines are also least effective in those who need prevention the most  the elderly and others with weaker immune systems 
pandemic vaccination is further complicated by the need to produce large quantities of vaccine in a short time period 
our universal flu vaccine candidate is designed to offer protection against divergent influenza strains  increase the efficacy of standard vaccines and potentially reduce the antigen content of vaccine to extend the quantity available during a pandemic 
sd hepatitis c therapy sd  our hepatitis c therapy  has completed a phase b clinical trial and is part of the portfolio of development programs that are available for partnership 
this therapy utilizes a novel type c tlr agonist based on our second generation iss 
sd is designed to be used in combination with current or emerging therapies to reduce hepatitis c virus hcv viral replication and induce a long lasting immune response 
in december  we completed the acquisition of symphony dynamo  inc  which provided us with full development and commercialization rights to sd data from a phase b trial and from an in vitro study of sd s mechanism of action show that sd is safe and well tolerated  and induces both ifn lambda and ifn alpha at concentrations producing antiviral activity 
dv hepatitis b therapy dv  our proprietary hepatitis b therapy  is completing a phase b clinical trial and is part of the portfolio of development programs that are available for partnership 
our treatment approach combines both the surface and core hbv antigens with iscomatrix adjuvant originally entered into development by rhein biotech prior to its acquisition by dynavax in dv is designed to induce an immune response against hbv infected cells and if proven to be safe and effective  may offer an alternative therapeutic option for patients chronically infected with hbv 
we have retained all commercial rights to this product 
the phase b dose escalation study assessed safety and the immunologic and virologic responses in subjects with chronic hepatitis b infection  including six patients that were hbeag negative and eight patients who were hbeag positive  and found the therapeutic regimen was safe and generally well tolerated at all dose levels  most common systemic reactions were fatigue and malaise 
no saes were recorded  the journal of infectious diseases  and vaccine 
table of contents dv was found to elicit immune responses at all dose levels  and anti hbe antibodies were elicited in two of eight patients  anti hbs antibodies were elicited in four of patients  amongst the eight hbeag positive patients  two had hbeag clearance  and one of those individuals also had hbsag clearance  three patients are still in the follow up observation period 
dv irs for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases we are developing dv  a bifunctional inhibitor of tlr and tlr  under a worldwide strategic alliance with gsk 
our irs program is focused on novel tlr inhibitors for diseases such as lupus  psoriasis  and rheumatoid arthritis 
we plan to initiate a phase clinical study with gsk in azd asthma therapy we have developed azd  a novel candidate drug for asthma  under our worldwide collaboration with astrazeneca 
azd utilizes our proprietary second generation iss and represents a new strategy for the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases such as asthma 
this therapy is designed to modify the course of these diseases by changing the basic immune response to environmental allergens  such as house dust and pollens  leading to prolonged reduction in asthma symptoms 
pharmaceutical partnerships and other funding agreements our objective is to discover novel therapies based on our proprietary technologies and develop a diversified pipeline of product candidates to build a product based business 
to reach this objective  an important part of our strategy is to establish partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies and enter into funding agreements 
our pharmaceutical partners provide valuable resources  expertise  and abilities that allow us to further advance the development of our product candidate programs 
we also have funding agreements with us government institutions 
glaxosmithkline in december  we entered into a worldwide strategic alliance with gsk to discover  develop  and commercialize endosomal tlr inhibitors for diseases such as lupus  psoriasis  and rheumatoid arthritis 
we received an initial payment of million and agreed to conduct research and early clinical development in up to four programs 
we are eligible to receive future potential development and commercialization milestones totaling approximately million per program 
gsk can exercise its exclusive option to license each program upon achievement of proof of concept or earlier upon certain circumstances 
after exercising its option  gsk would carry out further development and commercialization of these products 
we are eligible to receive royalties from the mid single digits up to the high teens based on product sales and have retained an option to co develop and co promote one specified product under the collaboration 
absent early termination  the agreement will expire when all of gsk s payment obligations expire 
either party may terminate the agreement early upon written notice if the other party commits an uncured material breach of the agreement 
either party may terminate the agreement in the event of insolvency of the other party 
gsk also has the option to terminate the agreement without cause  upon prior written notice within a specified window of time dependent upon stage of clinical development of the programs 

table of contents astrazeneca ab in september  we entered into a worldwide research and license agreement with astrazeneca to discover and develop tlr agonist products for asthma and copd 
we are eligible to receive a total of million in payments and  upon commercialization of these products  royalties up to the high teens based on product sales  if any 
astrazeneca has the right to sublicense its rights with our prior consent 
we also have the opportunity to co promote in the united states 
in september  we received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca for the nomination of the first candidate drug  azd  for asthma and have completed ind enabling studies 
absent early termination  the agreement will expire when all of astrazeneca s payment obligations expire 
astrazeneca has the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon prior written notice and either party may terminate the agreement early upon written notice if the other party commits an uncured material breach of the agreement 
novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc in july  we entered into a supply and option agreement with novartis related to our universal flu vaccine 
under this agreement  novartis is supplying trivalent influenza vaccine  an essential component of our universal flu vaccine 
we agreed to conduct early stage development through a defined proof of concept 
if novartis exercises the right to negotiate and enter a further agreement for development and commercialization  we would retain co commercialization rights in the united states and receive product royalties on product sales outside of the united states  if any 
if the option is not exercised or the parties do not enter into a further agreement  novartis remains committed to providing commercial supply of trivalent influenza vaccine with pre agreed commercial terms and we retain the right to independently continue with late stage development and commercialization  provided we do not partner with a company that produces or markets a trivalent influenza vaccine product in the united states 
either party may terminate the agreement if a the other party commits a material uncured breach  b there is change in control of the other party  c certain specified clinical or regulatory objectives are not achieved or certain development events or failures occur  or d dynavax ceases development of the product candidate for a certain length of time 
national institutes of health nih and other funding in september  we were awarded a million contract to develop our advanced iss technology using tlr agonists as vaccine adjuvants 
this five year contract was awarded by the nih s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid and supports adjuvant development for biodefense vaccines  including anthrax as well as other diseases 
niaid is funding of the total million cost of our program under contract no 
hhsnc 
the nih may terminate performance of work under the contract if the contracting officer determines that a termination is in the government s interest or if the company defaults in performing and fails to cure after notice 
during  we announced a grant from the niaid to take a systems biology approach to study the differences between individuals that do or do not respond to vaccination against the hbv 
this study will be one of several projects covered in a five year  million grant to the baylor institute of immunology research in dallas as part of the human immune phenotyping centers program 
we also received the award of a million grant from the nih to explore the feasibility of developing a universal vaccine to prevent infection by human papilloma virus hpv 
in contrast to the two approved hpv vaccines that target approximately of hpv strains  our goal is to develop a vaccine that provides immunity to nearly all cancer causing strains of hpv 
each year   new cases of cervical cancers are diagnosed worldwide  and  deaths are attributable to cervical cancers 

table of contents finally  million in grants under the patient protection and affordable care act of were awarded to us to cover research and development costs from and for our qualified therapeutic discovery projects including heplisav 
for our tlr inhibitor programs  since we have been awarded million in grants from the nih and alliance for lupus research 
intellectual property our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates  technology and know how  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
in addition to seeking patent protection in the united states  we generally file patent applications in australia  canada  japan  western european countries and additional foreign countries on a selective basis in order to further protect the inventions that we or our partners consider important to the development of our foreign business 
we also rely on trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information 
as of december   our intellectual property portfolio included issued us patents  over issued or granted foreign patents and over additional pending us and foreign patent applications claiming compositions and formulations of iss and irs  their methods of use or processes for their manufacture 
some of these patents and applications are exclusively licensed to us under two agreements with the regents of the university of california 
we have an issued us patent covering the iss contained in our heplisav investigational vaccine that will expire in  unless extended  and corresponding issued patents in several major european and other countries 
we own or have an exclusive license to us and foreign patent applications pending for each of our other product candidates and or their uses 
at present  it is not known or determinable whether patents will issue from any of these applications or what the specific expiration dates would be for any patents that do issue 
individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained 
generally  patents issued in the united states are effective for the longer of years from the issue date or years from the earliest effective filing date  if the patent application was filed prior to june   and years from the earliest effective filing date  if the patent application was filed on or after june  in addition  in certain instances  a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the fda regulatory review period 
the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law  but typically is years from the earliest effective filing date 
our patent estate  based on patents existing now and expected by us to issue based on pending applications  will expire on dates ranging from to the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis  from country to country and depends upon many factors  including the type of patent  the scope of its coverage  the availability of regulatory related extensions  the availability of legal remedies in a particular country  and the validity and enforceability of the patents 
because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until months after filing and publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in each of our issued 
table of contents patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications 
the us patent and trademark office may declare interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications and those of other parties or reexamination or reissue proceedings to determine if the scope of a patent should be narrowed 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
a number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  including pfizer  inc  as well as universities and research institutions  may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover inventions similar to the inventions owned or licensed to us 
we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any products 
if another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products  we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products 
two of our potential competitors  merck and gsk  are exclusive licensees of broad patents covering hepatitis b surface antigen  a component of heplisav 
in addition  the institut pasteur also owns or has exclusive licenses to patents covering hepatitis b surface antigen 
while some of these patents have expired or will soon expire outside the united states  they remain in force in the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party s proprietary rights 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
for example  pfizer has issued us and foreign patent claims as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices that  if held to be valid  could require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss 
to the extent we are able to commercialize heplisav in the united states while these patents remain in force  merck  gsk or the institut pasteur may bring claims against us 
litigation or any other proceedings  such as patent interferences  could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us  and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties  or require us to cease using some of our technology 
we may not prevail in any of these actions or proceedings 
in addition  other parties may duplicate  design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors 
we may rely  in some circumstances  on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology 
although trade secrets are difficult to protect  wherever possible  we use confidential disclosure agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our technology 
our policy is to require each of our commercial partners  employees  consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us 
however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets and or proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
under the terms of our license agreements with the regents of the university of california  we are required to pay license fees  make milestone payments  share a portion of fees from third party partnerships up to a specified amount and pay low single digit royalties on net sales resulting from successful products originating from the licensed technologies 
to date  we have paid the university of california a total of million in license fees  shared third party partnership fees and milestone payments under these agreements 
we estimate the total potential milestone payments payable for each such product will total approximately million  not 
table of contents including royalties 
we may terminate these agreements in whole or in part on days advance notice 
the regents of the university of california may terminate these agreements if we are in breach for failure to make royalty payments  meet diligence requirements  produce required reports or fund internal research and we do not cure such breach within days after being notified of the breach 
otherwise  the agreements generally continue in effect until the last patent claiming a product licensed under the agreement or its manufacture or use expires  or in the absence of patents  until the date the last patent application claiming a licensed product is abandoned 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies  intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products 
many of our competitors  including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions and other research organizations  are actively engaged in the discovery  research and development of products that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development 
heplisav  a two dose hepatitis b vaccine  if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with three dose marketed vaccines produced by gsk and merck co 
merck  among others 
there are also modified schedules of conventional hepatitis b vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in the european union and united states 
in addition  heplisav will compete against a number of multivalent vaccines that simultaneously protect against hepatitis b in addition to other diseases 
our universal flu vaccine  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete with traditional and emerging influenza vaccines from companies currently marketing these products  including gsk  novartis  sanofi pasteur  medimmune astrazeneca and csl ltd 
in addition  there are several companies developing potentially competing universal vaccines for influenza  including sanofi pasteur  vaxinnate  merck and vical 
our hepatitis c therapy  sd  if developed  approved  and commercialized  may compete directly with interferon alpha  products currently marketed by roche and merck 
other companies  such as vertex pharmaceuticals  inc tibotec pharmaceuticals  gilead sciences  inc 
gilead  merck  bristol myers squibb  and roche pharmasset  inc intermune  inc 
are developing direct acting antiviral therapy  including nsa inhibitors  protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors  and long acting interferons 
as these products may enter the market potentially within the next one to five years  combination therapy is likely to evolve 
novel therapies aim to improve the efficacy  safety and convenience of current hepatitis c treatment and may compete both directly and indirectly with sd our hepatitis b therapy  dv  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete directly with existing hepatitis b therapy products  including antiviral drugs and interferon alpha  manufactured by roche  merck  gilead  bristol myers squibb  gsk  and novartis 
in addition  our hepatitis b therapy faces competition from several companies developing novel antivirals and immunomodulators  including pharmasset and lg life sciences  cytheis and phytrix  as well as companies developing therapeutic vaccines  including genexine co  ltd 
our therapy for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  dv  is a bifunctional inhibitor of tlr and tlr that if developed  approved and commercialized will compete with key biologic therapies from companies such as genentech  inc genentech  biogen idec  roche  abbott laboratories and human genome sciences gsk 
in addition  our product would compete with generic drugs commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases  including corticosteroids  nsaids  antimalarials and immunosuppressive agents 
other companies  such as medimmune  genentech  idera  pfizer and ucb immunomedics  inc  are developing anti ifn alpha antibodies  b cell targeted antibodies  immunosuppressants  and other tlr inhibitors that may compete directly with our product candidate 
our asthma therapy  azd  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete indirectly with existing asthma therapies  such as inhaled beta agonists  corticosteroids  leukotriene inhibitors and ige 
table of contents monoclonal antibodies  including those marketed by merck  genentech  novartis  astrazeneca and gsk 
in addition  directly competing products are in development by sanofi aventis and idera pharmaceuticals 
many of the entities developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical testing  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly for collaborative agreements with large  established companies and access to capital 
these entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs 
regulatory considerations the advertising  labeling  storage  record keeping  safety  efficacy  research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of our potential products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to rigorous review by the fda under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations 
the steps ordinarily required by the fda before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the united states are similar to steps required in most other countries and include but are not limited to the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies and formulation studies  submission to the fda of an ind application for a new drug or biologic which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each proposed indication  demonstration of the consistent manufacturing of a drug substance and drug product  the submission of a new drug application nda or a biologics license application bla to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla before any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug 
if we do not comply with applicable requirements  us regulatory authorities may fine us  require that we recall our products  seize our products  require that we totally or partially suspend the production of our products  refuse to approve our marketing applications  criminally prosecute us  and or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations 
to secure fda approval  we must submit extensive non clinical and clinical data  adequate evidence of a product manufactured by a well controlled process that is safe and effective for its intended use  and other supporting information to the fda for each indication 
the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda and foreign regulatory agency approvals varies depending on the product candidate  the disease or condition for which the product candidate is in development and regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
further  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
in addition  the development of the drug substance and drug product may require manufacturing modifications to ensure future regulatory acceptance 
the approval process takes many years  requires the expenditures of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve requirements for additional post marketing studies 
the fda may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products 
the fda may withdraw product approvals if we do not continue to comply with regulatory standards 
table of contents or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays experienced during the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have exclusive rights to exploit patented products or technologies 
delays can occur at any stage of drug development and as a result of many factors  certain of which are not under our control  including but not limited to the following lack of efficacy  or incomplete or inconclusive results from clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  failure by investigators to adhere to protocol requirements  including patient enrollment criteria  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  failure by subjects to comply with trial protocol requirements  inability to follow patients adequately after treatment  inability to qualify and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture sufficient quality and quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  failure by a contract research organization to fulfill contractual obligations  and adverse changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance 
non clinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the initial efficacy and safety of the product 
the fda  under its good laboratory practices regulations  regulates non clinical studies 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of those studies  requiring these studies to be repeated 
the results of the non clinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind application  which must be approved by the fda before we can commence clinical investigations in humans 
unless the fda objects to an ind application  the ind application will become effective days following its receipt by the fda 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
we must conduct our clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice under protocols submitted to the fda as part of the ind application 
in addition  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an investigational review board and with patient informed consent 
the investigational review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial 
the stages of the fda regulatory process include research and preclinical studies and clinical trials in three sequential phases that may overlap 
research and preclinical studies do not involve the introduction of a product candidate in human subjects 
these activities involve identification of potential product candidates  modification of promising candidates to optimize their biological activity  as well as preclinical studies to assess safety and effectiveness in animals 
in clinical trials  the product candidate is administered to humans 
phase clinical trials typically involve the administration of a product candidate into a small group of healthy human subjects 
these trials are the first attempt to evaluate a drug s safety  determine a safe dose range and identify side effects 
during phase trials  the product candidate is introduced into patients who suffer from the medical condition that the product candidate is intended to treat 
phase studies are designed to evaluate whether a product candidate shows evidence of effectiveness  to further evaluate dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when phase evaluations demonstrate that a product candidate appears to be both safe and effective  phase trials are undertaken to confirm a product candidate s effectiveness and to test for safety in an expanded patient population 
if the results of phase trials appear to confirm effectiveness and safety  the data gathered in all phases of clinical trials form the basis for an application for fda regulatory approval of the product candidate 
we and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with fda s general 
table of contents biological product standards 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
good manufacturing practice regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
prior to granting product approval  the fda must determine that our or our third party contractor s manufacturing facilities meet gmp requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products 
in addition  our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda for continued compliance with gmp requirements during clinical development as well as following product approval 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal 
outside the united states  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization and pricing or reimbursement approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing authorization  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations may be applied for at a national level  although within the european union centralized registration procedures are mandatory for biotechnology and some other drugs and are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the regulatory authority generally will grant marketing authorization if it is satisfied that we have presented it with adequate evidence of a product manufactured by a well controlled process that is safe and effective for its intended use 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research 
we cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action 
research and development conducting a significant amount of research and development has been central to our business model 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
environment we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures for environmental compliance and protection 
we do not expect that expenditures for compliance with environmental laws will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or results of operations in the future 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including phds  phds and others with advanced degrees 
of the employees  were dedicated to research and development activities 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and we believe our relations with our employees are good

table of contents item a 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning our future products  product candidates  timing of development activities  regulatory strategies  intellectual property position  expenses  revenues  liquidity and cash needs  as well as our plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update this information 
numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward looking statements  including the following risk factors 
risks related to our finances and capital requirements we have incurred substantial losses since inception and do not have any commercial products that generate revenue 
we have experienced significant net losses in each year since our inception 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  to date  our revenue has resulted from collaboration agreements  services and license fees from customers of dynavax europe  and government and private agency grants 
the grants are subject to annual review based on the achievement of milestones and other factors 
we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional net losses in future years as a result of our investment in research and development activities 
we do not have any products that generate revenue 
there can be no assurance whether heplisav can be further developed  financed or commercialized in a timely manner without significant additional studies or patient data or significant expense  whether development efforts will be sufficient to support approval of heplisav  or whether the market for heplisav will be sufficient for us to reach profitability 
clinical trials for certain of our other product candidates are ongoing  and our other product candidates may never be commercialized or achieve profitability 
our ability to generate revenue depends upon demonstrating in clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective  obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and entering into and maintaining successful collaborative relationships 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability  we may be required to reduce or discontinue our current and planned operations  enter into a transaction that constitutes a change in control of the company  or raise additional capital on less than favorable terms 
additionally  if we continue to incur substantial additional net losses without additional equity funding  we will continue to deplete our stockholders equity  and if such equity balance falls below the listing requirement threshold of million for the nasdaq capital market  we may be delisted 
we require substantial additional capital to continue development of our product candidates  in particular our most advanced candidate  heplisav 
we cannot be certain that funds will be available and  if they are not available  we may not be able to continue as a going concern which may result in actions that could adversely impact our stockholders 
in order to continue development of our product candidates  particularly heplisav  we still need to raise significant additional funds 
this may occur through our september purchase agreement the purchase agreement with aspire capital fund  llc aspire capital  future public or private financings and or strategic alliance and licensing arrangements 
we expect to continue to spend substantial funds in connection with development and manufacturing of our product candidates  particularly heplisav  various human clinical trials for our product candidates  and protection of our intellectual property 

table of contents we currently estimate that we will have sufficient resources to meet our anticipated cash needs through the next twelve months based on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december   anticipated revenues from existing agreements and the funding available to us under the purchase agreement 
sufficient additional financing through future public or private financings  strategic alliance and licensing arrangements or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
additional equity financings  if completed  could result in significant dilution or otherwise adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available in the future  we would need to delay  reduce the scope of  or put on hold the heplisav program or other development programs while we seek strategic alternatives 
the sale of our common stock to aspire capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by aspire capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
shares offered to aspire capital under the purchase agreement may be sold over a period of up to months from the date of the purchase agreement subject to the limitations and conditions of the agreement 
the number of our shares ultimately offered for sale by aspire capital is dependent upon the number of shares we elect to sell to aspire capital under the purchase agreement and the number of authorized shares we have available for sale 
aspire capital may ultimately purchase all  some or none of the remaining common stock provided for in the purchase agreement 
as of december   we have issued  shares of common stock under the purchase agreement 
after aspire capital has acquired shares pursuant to the purchase agreement  it may sell all  some or none of those shares 
on any business day on which the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds per share  we have a right to sell up to a maximum of  shares per day under the purchase agreement  which total may be increased by mutual agreement up to an additional  shares per day 
the capital available under the purchase agreement may not be sufficient to fund our current need for capital 
the extent to which we rely on aspire capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors  including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  sales of shares of our common stock by aspire capital may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  sales to aspire capital by us pursuant to the purchase agreement may result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to aspire capital  or anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
however  we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to aspire capital and the purchase agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us 
our independent registered public accountants have indicated that our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  a statement with respect to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue to operate as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
if we became unable to continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents risks related to our business the success of our product candidates depends on timely achievement of successful clinical results  adequate evidence of a product manufactured by a well controlled process that is safe and effective for its intended use and regulatory approval 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could require us to discontinue operations 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale by any regulatory agency 
any product candidate we develop is subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the us food and drug administration fda and by foreign regulatory agencies 
our success is primarily dependent on our ability to timely enroll patients in clinical trials  achieve successful clinical results  provide adequate evidence of a product manufactured by a well controlled process that is safe and effective for its intended use  and obtain regulatory approvals for our most advanced product candidates 
approval processes in the united states and in other countries are uncertain  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we will need to demonstrate in clinical trials that a product candidate is safe and effective before we can obtain the necessary approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
if we identify any safety issues associated with our product candidates  we may be restricted from initiating further trials for those products 
moreover  we may not see sufficient signs of efficacy in those studies 
the fda or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to conduct additional clinical trials prior to approval 
despite the time and money expended  regulatory approvals are uncertain 
in addition  failure to timely and successfully complete clinical trials and show that our products are safe and effective would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
even if approved  the labeling approved by the relevant regulatory authority for a product may restrict to whom we may market the product  which could significantly limit the commercial opportunity for such product 
prior to granting product approval  the fda must determine that our or our third party contractor s manufacturing facilities meet gmp requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products 
we and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda gmp current regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with fda s general biological product standards 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
good manufacturing practice regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
our clinical trials may be extended  suspended  delayed or terminated at any time 
even short delays in the commencement and progress of our trials may lead to substantial delays in the regulatory approval process for our product candidates  which will impair our ability to generate revenues 
we may extend  suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including regulatory actions by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  actions by institutional review boards  failure to comply with good clinical practice requirements  concerns regarding health risks to test subjects  failure to enroll patients in a timely manner  or delays due to manufacturing an inadequate supply of the product candidate 
even a short delay in a trial for any product candidate could require us to delay commencement or continuation of a trial until the target population is available for testing  which could result in a delay of a year or more 
the fda may require larger or additional clinical trials for our heplisav product candidate than we currently expect before granting regulatory approval  if at all 

table of contents our registration and commercial timelines depend on successful completion of current and planned clinical trials  successful results from such trials  and further discussions with the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies 
any extension  suspension  modification  termination or unanticipated delays of our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to timely and successfully commercialize or market these product candidates  result in significant additional costs  potentially diminish any competitive advantages for those products  potentially limit the markets for those products  adversely affect our ability to enter into collaborations  receive milestone payments or royalties from potential collaborators  cause us to abandon the development of the affected product candidate  or limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
we rely on contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not fulfill their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines  our planned clinical trials may be delayed and we may fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform their obligations or meet expected deadlines our planned clinical trials may be extended  delayed  modified or terminated 
any extension  delay  modification or termination of our clinical trials could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
heplisav and most of our earlier stage programs rely on iss based technology 
serious adverse safety data relating to either iss or other iss based technology may require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations 
heplisav is based on our iss compound  and most of our research and development programs use iss based technology 
if any of our product candidates in clinical trials produce serious adverse safety data  we may be required to delay  discontinue or modify our clinical trials or our clinical trial strategy 
for example  from march until september  the two investigational new drug ind applications for heplisav were placed on clinical hold by the fda following a serious adverse event that occurred in one of our clinical trials 
in september  the fda removed the clinical hold on the ind application for individuals with chronic kidney disease but the other ind application for heplisav remains on clinical hold 
in addition  most of our clinical product candidates contain iss  and if a common safety risk across therapeutic areas were identified  it may hinder our ability to enter into potential collaborations and if adverse safety data are found to apply to our iss based technology as a whole  we may be required to significantly reduce or discontinue our operations 
we rely on our facility in d sseldorf  germany and third parties to supply materials necessary to manufacture our clinical product candidates 
we have limited experience in manufacturing sufficient quantities of iss for our clinical trials and rely on limited third parties to produce the iss we need for our clinical trials 
additionally  we have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in commercial quantities 
if we reduce our clinical product candidates  we may not require this manufacturing capacity 
we rely on a number of third parties for the multiple steps involved in the manufacturing process of our product candidates  including iss  the production of certain antigens  the combination of the antigens and iss and the fill and finish 
termination or interruption of these relationships may occur due to circumstances that are outside of our control  resulting in higher cost or delays in our product development efforts 

table of contents we have relied on a limited number of suppliers to produce iss for clinical trials and a single supplier to produce our iss for heplisav 
to date  we have manufactured only small quantities of iss and iss ourselves for development purposes 
if we were unable to maintain our existing source for iss  we would have to establish an alternate qualified manufacturing capability  which would result in significant additional operating costs and delays in developing and commercializing our product candidates  particularly heplisav 
we or other third parties may not be able to produce iss at a cost  quantity and quality that are available from our current third party supplier 
we currently utilize our facility in d sseldorf to manufacture the hepatitis b surface antigen for heplisav 
the commercial manufacturing of vaccines and other biological products is a time consuming and complex process  which must be performed in compliance with current gmp regulations 
we may not be able to comply with these and comparable foreign regulations  and our manufacturing process may be subject to delays  disruptions or quality control quality assurance problems 
noncompliance with these regulations or other problems with our manufacturing process may limit or delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates and could result in significant expense 
moreover  if our heplisav clinical trials are sufficient for approval and depending on the level of market acceptance of the product  we may not have the capacity in our existing facility to meet all of our commercial supply needs in the future 
if heplisav cannot be successfully developed or is not commercially viable  we will have to use the d sseldorf facility for alternative manufacturing or research activities that may not fully utilize the facility s capacity  resulting in continued operating costs that may not be offset by corresponding revenues 
we may also consider other alternatives for the d sseldorf facility  including its sale or closure  which would result in certain costs of disposal or discontinuation of operations 
discontinuation of operations in d sseldorf would be complex  expensive  time consuming and difficult to execute without significant additional costs due to  among other things  international legal and tax considerations related to those operations 
as a result  we may not realize cost savings associated with closure of the d sseldorf operations  if at all 
if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing fda and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review 
we and our third party suppliers are required to comply with applicable current gmp regulations and other international regulatory requirements 
the regulations require that our product candidates be manufactured and our records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and quality control quality assurance activities 
suppliers of key components and materials must be named in a bla submitted to the fda for any product candidate for which we are seeking fda approval 
additionally  these third parties and our manufacturing facility must undergo a pre approval inspection before we can obtain marketing authorization for any of our product candidates 
even after a manufacturer has been qualified by the fda  the manufacturer must continue to expend time  money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with gmp 
manufacturers are subject to regular  periodic inspections by the fda following initial approval 
further  to the extent that we contract with third parties for the manufacture of our products  our ability to control third party compliance with fda requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection 
if  as a result of these inspections  the fda determines that the equipment  facilities  laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable fda regulations and conditions of product approval  the fda may suspend the manufacturing operations 
if the manufacturing operations of any of the suppliers for our product candidates are suspended  we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand  which would harm our business 
in addition  if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason  we may be unable to ship our approved product for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials 
significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required 

table of contents any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates are likely to contain requirements for post marketing follow up studies  which may be costly 
product approvals  once granted  may be modified based on data from subsequent studies or commercial use 
as a result  limitations on labeling indications or marketing claims  or withdrawal from the market may be required if problems occur after commercialization 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could prevent or delay marketing approval or require the expenditure of money or other resources to correct 
failure to comply with applicable requirements may also result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution  any of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and our stock price 
we may develop  seek regulatory approval for and market our product candidates outside the united states  requiring a significant commitment of resources 
failure to successfully manage our international operations could result in significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may introduce certain of our product candidates in various markets outside the united states 
developing  seeking regulatory approval for and marketing our product candidates outside the united states could impose substantial burdens on our resources and divert management s attention from domestic operations 
international operations are subject to risk  including the difficulty of managing geographically distant operations  including recruiting and retaining qualified employees  locating adequate facilities and establishing useful business support relationships in the local community  compliance with varying international regulatory requirements  laws and treaties  securing international distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  legal uncertainties and potential timing delays associated with tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  diverse tax consequences  the fluctuation of conversion rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  and regional and geopolitical risks 
to date  we have not filed for marketing approval for any of our product candidates outside the united states 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other foreign countries 
however  a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions  including approval by the fda 
if we are unable to successfully manage our international operations  we may incur significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  which would impair our ability to generate revenues 
if any products we develop are not accepted by the market or if regulatory agencies limit our labeling indications or marketing claims  we may be unable to generate significant revenues  if any 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and are able to commercialize them  our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payors and the medical community 

table of contents the degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend upon a number of factors  including the indication for which the product is approved and its approved labeling  the presence of other competing approved therapies  the potential advantages of the product over existing and future treatment methods  the relative convenience and ease of administration of the product  the strength of our sales  marketing and distribution support  the price and cost effectiveness of the product  and sufficient third party reimbursement 
the fda or other regulatory agencies could limit the labeling indication for which our product candidates may be marketed or could otherwise limit marketing efforts for our products 
for example  in connection with the removal of the clinical hold on heplisav in september and related discussions with the fda  it is expected that further development of heplisav in the united states initially will be limited to individuals who are less responsive to current licensed vaccines  including adults over years of age and individuals with chronic kidney disease 
if we are unable to achieve approval or successfully market any of our product candidates  or marketing efforts are restricted by regulatory limits  our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired 
we face uncertainty related to coverage  pricing and reimbursement and the practices of third party payors  which may make it difficult or impossible to sell our product candidates on commercially reasonable terms 
in both domestic and foreign markets  our ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on the negotiation of a favorable price or the availability of appropriate reimbursement from third party payors  in particular for heplisav where existing products are approved for our target indications 
existing laws affecting the pricing and coverage of pharmaceuticals and other medical products by government programs and other third party payors may change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services  and pricing and reimbursement decisions may not allow our products to compete effectively with existing or competitive products 
because we intend to offer products  if approved  that involve new technologies and new approaches to treating disease  the willingness of third party payors to reimburse for our products is particularly uncertain 
we will have to charge a price for our products that is sufficiently high to enable us to recover our considerable investment in product development 
adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to achieve profitability and could harm our future prospects and reduce our stock price 
we are unable to predict what impact the health care and education reconciliation act of or other reform legislation will have on our business or future prospects 
the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the implementation of any proposed reforms limits our ability to forecast changes that may affect our business 
in europe  the success of our products  in particular heplisav  will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because many providers in european countries are unlikely to use medical products that are not reimbursed by their governments 

table of contents a key part of our business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of our product candidates 
we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships  which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products successfully  if at all 
we will need to establish collaborative relationships to obtain domestic and international sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates  in particular with respect to the commercialization of heplisav 
failure to obtain a collaborative relationship for heplisav  particularly in the european union  may significantly impair the potential for this product and our ability to successfully develop  manufacture and commercialize heplisav as a product candidate 
we also will need to enter into collaborative relationships to provide funding to support our other research and development programs 
the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult  time consuming and involves significant uncertainty  including our partners may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results  manufacturing issues  a change in business strategy  a change of control or other reasons  our shortage of capital resources may impact the willingness of companies to collaborate with us  our contracts for collaborative arrangements are terminable at will on written notice and may otherwise expire or terminate and we may not have alternative funding available  our partners may choose to pursue alternative technologies  including those of our competitors  we may have disputes with a partner that could lead to litigation or arbitration  we have limited control over the decisions of our partners and they may change the priority of our programs in a manner that would result in termination of the agreement or add significant delay in the partnered program  our ability to generate future event payments and royalties from our partners depends upon the abilities of our partners to establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  obtain regulatory approvals  successfully manufacture  and achieve market acceptance of products developed from our drug candidates  we or our partners may fail to properly initiate  maintain or defend our intellectual property rights  where applicable  or a party may utilize our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or potentially invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability  our partners may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our product candidates  and our partners may not comply with applicable government regulatory requirements 
if any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner  or at all  our research  clinical development  manufacturing  or commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated  or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator 
if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements  we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates  undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital 
the financial terms of future collaborative licensing or financing arrangements could result in dilution of our share value 
funding from collaboration partners and other parties may in the future involve issuance of our equity securities 
because we do not currently have any such arrangements  we cannot be certain how the terms under 
table of contents which such shares are issued will be determined or when such determinations will be made 
the current market for financing or collaborative arrangements often involves the issuance of warrants as additional consideration in establishing the purchase price of the equity securities issued 
any such issuance could result in dilution in the value of our issued and outstanding shares 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise than we do 
if we are unable to successfully compete with existing or potential competitors despite these disadvantages we may be unable to generate revenues and our business will be harmed 
we compete with pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and research organizations  in developing therapies to prevent or treat infectious and inflammatory diseases 
competitors may develop more effective  more affordable or more convenient products or may achieve earlier patent protection or commercialization of their products 
these competitive products may render our product candidates obsolete or limit our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  general and administrative support  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
existing and potential competitors may also compete with us for qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as for technology that would be advantageous to our business 
our success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  manufacturing  sales  marketing  general and administrative and management personnel 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel  our operations may suffer and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we may not be able to obtain financing  enter into collaborative arrangements  sell our product candidates or generate revenues 
the loss of key personnel  including our chief executive officer or our president  could delay or prevent achieving our objectives 
our research  product development and business efforts could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key members of our scientific or management staff  including our chief executive officer  dr 
dino dina  or our president  dr 
j 
tyler martin 
we currently have no key person insurance on any of our employees 
we face product liability exposure  which  if not covered by insurance  could result in significant financial liability 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products will subject us to potential product liability claims and may raise questions about a product s safety and efficacy 
as a result  we could experience a delay in our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates or reduced sales of any approved product candidates 
in addition  a product liability claim may exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we have obtained limited clinical trial liability and umbrella insurance coverage for our clinical trials 
this coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts  at an acceptable cost or at all 
we also may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing in the future 
a product liability claim  product recalls or other claims  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  would divert our management s attention from our business and could result in significant financial liability 

table of contents we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims or liabilities relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly to resolve 
our research and product development activities involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all government permits that are required for the storage  use and disposal of these materials 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to persons or property from these materials 
in the event of an accident related to hazardous materials  we could be held liable for damages  cleanup costs or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
risks related to our intellectual property we rely on licenses to intellectual property from third parties 
impairment of these licenses or our inability to maintain them would severely harm our business 
our current research and development efforts depend upon our license arrangements for intellectual property owned by third parties 
our dependence on these licenses subjects us to numerous risks  such as disputes regarding the use of the licensed intellectual property and the creation and ownership of new discoveries under such license agreements 
in addition  these license arrangements require us to make timely payments in order to maintain our licenses and typically contain diligence or milestone based termination provisions 
our failure to meet any obligations pursuant to these agreements could allow our licensors to terminate our agreements or undertake other remedies such as converting exclusive to non exclusive licenses if we are not able to cure or obtain waivers for such failures or amend such agreements on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  our license agreements may be terminated or may expire by their terms  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of these licenses 
if we cannot obtain and maintain licenses that are advantageous or necessary to the development or the commercialization of our product candidates  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license similar technology or to find other alternatives to maintaining the competitive position of our products 
if such alternatives are not available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue development or commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  we must make timely payments or meet diligence obligations in order to maintain any such licenses in effect 
in the absence of a current license  we may be required to redesign our technology so it does not infringe a third party s patents  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
if third parties successfully assert that we have infringed their patents and proprietary rights or challenge our patents and proprietary rights  we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly  time consuming  and delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights  or we may be required to enter into litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the ownership  scope or validity of our or another party s proprietary rights  including a challenge as to the validity of our issued and pending claims 
we are involved in various interference and other administrative proceedings related to our intellectual property which has caused us to incur certain legal expenses 
if we become involved in any litigation and or other significant interference proceedings related to our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others  we will incur substantial additional expenses and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
two of our potential competitors  merck and gsk  are exclusive licensees of broad patents covering hepatitis b surface antigen  a component of heplisav 
in addition  the institut pasteur also owns or has exclusive licenses to patents covering hepatitis b surface antigen 
while some of these patents have expired or 
table of contents will soon expire outside the united states  they remain in force in the united states 
to the extent we are able to commercialize heplisav in the united states while these patents remain in force  merck  gsk or the institut pasteur may bring claims against us 
if we or our collaborators are unsuccessful in defending or prosecuting our issued and pending claims or in defending potential claims against our products  for example  as may arise in the commercialization of heplisav or any similar product candidate  we or our collaborator could be required to pay substantial damages or be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies without a license from such third party 
a license may require the payment of substantial fees or royalties  require a grant of a cross license to our technology or may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any of these outcomes could require us to change our business strategy and could materially impact our business and operations 
one of our potential competitors  pfizer inc  has issued patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices  that may be asserted against our iss products 
we may need to obtain a license to one or more of these patent claims held by pfizer by paying fees or royalties or offering rights to our own proprietary technologies in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss in other than with respect to heplisav  for which we have a license 
a license for other uses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could preclude or limit our ability to commercialize our products 
if the combination of patents  trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property is inadequate  the value of our product candidates will decrease 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and protect commercially valuable patents or the rights to patents both domestically and abroad  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from successfully challenging or infringing our proprietary rights 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use only to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary rights by filing and prosecuting us and foreign patent applications 
however  in certain cases such protection may be limited  depending in part on existing patents held by third parties  which may only allow us to obtain relatively narrow patent protection 
in the united states  legal standards relating to the validity and scope of patent claims in the biopharmaceutical field can be highly uncertain  are still evolving and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
the biopharmaceutical patent environment outside the united states is even more uncertain 
we may be particularly affected by this uncertainty since several of our product candidates may initially address market opportunities outside the united states  where we may only be able to obtain limited patent protection 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following we may not receive an issued patent for any of our patent applications or for any patent applications that we have exclusively licensed  the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection or may not be valid or enforceable  we might not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  
table of contents the patents licensed or issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a competitive advantage  patents issued to other parties may limit our intellectual property protection or harm our ability to do business  other parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we attempt to patent  and other parties may design around technologies we have licensed  patented or developed 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
any disclosure of confidential data in the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets 
if we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce proprietary rights we may be unable to commercialize our products  enter into collaborations  generate revenues or maintain any advantage we may have with respect to existing or potential competitors 
risks related to an investment in our common stock our stock price is subject to volatility  and your investment may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  many of which are beyond our control  including progress or results of any of our clinical trials or regulatory efforts  in particular any announcements regarding the progress or results of our planned trials and communications from the fda or other regulatory agencies  our ability to establish and maintain collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  technological innovations  new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio or developments or disputes concerning the proprietary rights of our products or product candidates  our ability to obtain component materials and successfully enter into manufacturing relationships for our product candidates or establish manufacturing capacity on our own  our ability to establish and maintain licensing agreements for intellectual property necessary for the development of our product candidates  changes in government regulations  general economic conditions or industry announcements  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  our ability to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq markets or similar exchanges  and the volume of trading in our common stock 
one or more of these factors could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock 
in addition  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk may be particularly relevant for us because we have experienced greater than average stock price volatility 
we may in the future be the target of such litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs  and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents the anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  delaware law and our share purchase rights plan may prevent or frustrate a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock with voting rights to be determined by the board of directors  limiting the persons who can call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent  creating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three year terms  providing that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is required for amendment to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
our share purchase rights plan may have certain anti takeover effects 
specifically  the rights issued pursuant to the plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company on terms not approved by the company s board of directors 
although the rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors since the rights issued may be amended to permit such acquisition or redeemed by the company at per right prior to the earliest of i the time that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the common shares or ii the final expiration date of the rights  the effect of the rights plan may deter a potential acquisition of the company 
in addition  we remain subject to the provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for three years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
we will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies  which could affect our operating results 
as a public company  we will continue to incur legal  accounting and other expenses associated with reporting requirements and corporate governance requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank act of  as well as new rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market llc 
we may need to continue to implement additional financial and accounting systems  procedures and controls in order to accommodate changes in our business and organization and to comply with new reporting requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a favorable assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to reach an unqualified assessment  or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to issue an unqualified attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting which could harm our business and could impact the price of our common stock 

table of contents future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales might occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities

symphony capital partners  lp and symphony strategic partners  llc collectively  symphony currently collectively control approximately  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
based on the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding as of december   symphony owns approximately of our total outstanding shares of our common stock
