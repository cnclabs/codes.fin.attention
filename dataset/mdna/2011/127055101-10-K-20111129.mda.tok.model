item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if i the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and ii different estimates and assumptions were used  the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below 
revenue recognition and accounts and notes receivable we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
if we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of shipping terms  the revenue is considered unearned and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
the following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of our reportable segments 
years ended september core segment performance segment new business segment specialty fluids segment we derive the substantial majority of revenues from the sale of products in our core and performance segments 
revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
we offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives 
the discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations 
we periodically review the assumptions underlying the estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly 
revenue in the new business segment is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
depending on the nature of the contract with the customer  a portion of the segment s revenue may be recognized using proportional performance 
the majority of the revenue in the specialty fluids segment arises from the rental of cesium formate 
this revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms 
customers are also billed and revenue is recognized  typically at the end of the job  for cesium formate product that is not returned 
on occasion we also make sales of cesium formate outside of a rental process and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the fluid 

table of contents we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable and other economic information on both an historical and prospective basis 
customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
changes in the allowance during fiscal and were not material 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances 
inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
total us inventories utilizing this cost flow assumption was million at both september  and these inventories represent and of total worldwide inventories at the respective year ends 
had we used the first in  first out fifo method instead of the lifo method for such inventories  the value of those inventories would have been million and million higher as of september  and  respectively 
the cost of other us and all non us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
in periods of rapidly rising or declining raw material costs  the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability 
under our current lifo method  when raw material costs are rising  our most recent higher priced purchases are the first to be charged to cost of sales 
if  however  we were using a fifo method  our purchases from earlier periods  which were at lower prices  would instead be the first charged to cost of sales 
the opposite result could occur during a period of rapid decline in raw material costs 
at certain times  we may decrease inventory levels to the point where layers of inventory recorded under the lifo method that were purchased in preceding years are liquidated 
the inventory in these layers may be valued at an amount that is different than our current costs 
if there is a liquidation of an inventory layer  there may be an impact to our cost of sales and net income for that period 
if the liquidated inventory is at a cost lower than our current cost  there would be a reduction in our cost of sales and an increase to our net income during the period 
conversely  if the liquidated inventory is at a cost higher than our current cost  there will be an increase in our cost of sales and a reduction to our net income during the period 
during fiscal inventory quantities were reduced at our us rubber blacks and performance products sites  leading to liquidations of lifo inventory quantities 
these lifo layer liquidations resulted in a decrease of cost of goods sold of million and an increase in consolidated net income of million per diluted common share for fiscal no such reductions occurred in either fiscal or we review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential loss of value periodically 
in this review  we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete  unmarketable or slow moving inventory 
we write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
historically  such write downs have not been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment  however  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings 
stock based compensation we have issued restricted stock  restricted stock units  and stock options under our equity compensation plans 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is the market price of our stock on the day of the grant 
the fair value is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the vesting of certain restricted stock units is dependent on certain performance based criteria 
we evaluate the likelihood of achievement of such performance objectives each quarter and record stock based compensation based on this assessment 
there are no other significant estimates involved in recording compensation costs for restricted stock units with the exception of estimates we make around the probability of forfeitures 
changes in the forfeiture assumptions could impact our earnings but would not impact our cash flows 

table of contents we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options issued under our equity compensation plans 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we make a variety of assumptions and estimates  including discount rates  volatility measures  expected dividends and expected option lives 
changes to such assumptions and estimates can result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings 
such changes would not impact our cash flows 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is comprised of the cost of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually  or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the annual review is performed as of march st of each year 
for the reporting units that carry goodwill balances  our impairment test consists of a comparison of each reporting unit s carrying value to its estimated fair value 
a reporting unit  for the purpose of the impairment test  is at or below the operating segment level 
we have three reporting units that carry goodwill balances rubber blacks  fumed metal oxides  and security materials 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is primarily based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
we validate this model by considering other factors such as the fair value of comparable companies to our reporting units  and also perform a reconciliation of the fair value of all our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 
the assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flows are based on our best estimates of future growth rates  operating cash flows  capital expenditures  discount rates and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the risk free rate of return  cost of debt  and expected equity premiums 
if an impairment exists  a loss is recorded to write down the value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
as a result of the test completed for march   the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units 
as of september   our goodwill balance is allocated between three reporting units rubber blacks  million  fumed metal oxides  million  and security materials  million 
there have been no goodwill impairment charges during the periods presented in these financial statements 
our long lived assets primarily include property  plant and equipment  long term investments  assets held for rent and sale and intangible assets 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the way the asset is being used  a decline in the physical condition of the asset or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in the recent past  impairments have generally been recognized when we determine that we will restructure certain operations 
to test for impairment of assets we generally use a probability weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets or asset grouping over the remaining life of the asset to determine if the asset is recoverable 
if we determine that the asset is not recoverable  we determine if there is a potential impairment loss by calculating the fair value of the asset using a probability weighted discounted estimate of future cash flows 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the risk free rate of return  cost of debt  and expected equity premiums 
to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group  an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of operations in that period 

table of contents financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivables  investments  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments 
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate fair value with the exception of our long term debt that has not been designated as part of a fair value hedge 
the non hedged long term debt is recorded at amortized cost 
the fair values of our financial instruments are based on quoted market prices  if such prices are available 
in situations where quoted market prices are not available  we rely on valuation models to derive fair value 
for interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps  we use standard models with market based inputs 
the significant inputs to these models are interest rate curves for discounting future cash flows 
in determining the fair value of the commodity derivatives  the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets 
such valuation takes into account the ability of the financial counterparty to perform 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes  nor do we hold or issue any financial instruments for trading purposes 
all derivatives are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
where we have a legal right to offset derivative settlements under a master netting agreement with a counterparty  derivatives with that counterparty are presented on a net basis 
the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in either earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  depending on whether or not the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if designated as part of a hedge transaction  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings during the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
although these derivatives are not designated as hedges  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
we record in earnings the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges 
cash movements associated with these instruments are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flows from operating activities because the derivatives are designed to mitigate risk to our cash flow from operations 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value  including assets that are part of our defined benefit pension plans  are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used for valuation 
assets that are actively traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as level assets and liabilities that are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or standard pricing models using observable inputs are classified as level as of september   we have no assets or liabilities carried at fair value that are valued using unobservable inputs and  therefore  no assets or liabilities that are classified as level the sensitivity of fair value estimates is immaterial relative to the assets and liabilities measured at fair value  as well as to our total equity  as of september  pensions and other postretirement benefits we maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees 
in addition  we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
the assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans  are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans where applicable and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees 
the most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets 
assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied  they include 
table of contents estimated discount rates  rates of compensation increases for employees  mortality  employee turnover and other related demographic data 
projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends 
we compute our recorded obligations globally in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
under such principles  if actual results differ from what is projected  the differences are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
however  cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  restructuring activities and other employee actions relative to normal operations resulted in certain pension plan curtailments and settlements  which tend to accelerate the recognition of the deferred gains and losses 
self insurance reserves we are partially self insured for certain third party liabilities globally  as well as workers compensation and employee medical benefits in the united states 
the third party and workers compensation liabilities are managed through a wholly owned insurance captive and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
the employee medical obligations are managed by a third party provider and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
to limit our potential liabilities for these risks  however  we purchase insurance from third parties that provides individual and aggregate stop loss protection 
the aggregate self insured liability in fiscal for combined third party liabilities  us workers compensation and employee medical benefits is million  and the retention for medical costs in the united states is at most  per person per annum 
we have accrued amounts equal to the actuarially determined future liabilities 
we determine the actuarial assumptions in collaboration with third party actuaries  based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as legal actions  medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and impact our earnings and cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations by estimating incremental costs for special handling  removal and disposal costs of materials that may or will give rise to conditional asset retirement obligations aros and then discount the expected costs back to the current year using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
aro liabilities and costs are recognized when the timing and or settlement can be reasonably estimated 
if it is unclear when  or if  an aro will be triggered  we use probability weightings for possible timing scenarios to determine the amounts that should be recognized in our financial statements 
the estimation of aros is subject to a number of inherent uncertainties including a the timing of when any aro may be incurred  b the ability to accurately identify and reasonably estimate the costs of all materials that may require special handling or treatment  c the ability to assess the relative probability of different scenarios that could give rise to an aro  and d other factors outside our control  including changes in regulations  costs and interest rates 
aros have not been recognized for certain of our facilities because either the present value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable facility life or we do not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of those facilities 
in most circumstances where aros have been recorded  the anticipated cash outflows will likely take place far into the future 
accordingly  actual costs and the timing of such costs may vary significantly from our estimates  which may  in turn  impact our earnings 
in general  however  when such estimates change  the impact is spread over future years and thus the impact on any individual year is unlikely to be material 

table of contents litigation and contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury and environmental litigation 
after consultation with counsel  as appropriate  we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information  including claims  settlement offers  demands by government agencies  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute  and our prior experience 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows 
the most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims 
the amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites  the nature of the remedies  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters is recognized on a discounted basis  which requires the use of an estimated discount rate and estimates of future cash flows associated with the liability 
these liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information  changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations  which could result in higher or lower costs 
our current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time and the amount accrued is recognized on a discounted basis 
developments that could affect our estimate include  but are not limited to  i significant changes in the number of future claims  ii changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending silica and non malignant asbestos claims  iii significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims  iv significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims  v changes in the nature of claims received  vi changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims  vii the financial viability of other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims  viii a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by the entity from which we acquired the safety respiration products business or the indemnity provided by its former owner  ix changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs and x a determination that our assumptions regarding contractual obligations on which we have estimated our share of liability are inaccurate 
we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims 
accordingly  the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount 
further  if the timing of our actual payments made for respirator claims differs significantly from our estimated payment schedule  and we determine that we can no longer reasonably predict the timing of such payments  we could then be required to record the reserve amount on an undiscounted basis on our consolidated balance sheets  causing an immediate impact to earnings 
income taxes our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries 
we file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction s tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination 
table of contents uncertain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  and or our cash flow 
we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities 
if this threshold is not met  no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized 
if the threshold is met  the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this analysis presumes the taxing authorities full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts  but does not consider the time value of money 
we also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards  foreign tax credits  and other income tax credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time 
we review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets 
an increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense  while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense 
highly inflationary environments we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment 
if and when a currency is determined to be highly inflationary cumulative inflation of approximately percent or more over a year period  the functional currency of the affected operation would be changed to our reporting currency  the us dollar 
due to cumulative inflation in venezuela over a three year period exceeding as of january   the functional currency of our venezuelan operating entity has changed to the us dollar 
restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance and other employee benefits to be granted to employees  which are based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii costs to vacate certain facilities and iii asset impairments 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of subsequent information that may come to our attention while executing the restructuring plans 
these changes in estimates would then be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies we have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item below 
certain of these policies include the use of estimates  but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure 
however  these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations definition of terms when discussing our income loss from operations  we use several terms 
the following discussion of results includes information on our reportable segment sales and segment or business operating profit loss before interest and tax ebit 
in calculating segment ebit  we exclude certain items  meaning items that are considered by management to be unusual and not representative of segment results 
in addition  in calculating segment ebit  we include equity in net income of affiliated companies  net of tax  royalties paid by equity affiliates and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of tax  but exclude interest expense  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  interest income  dividend income  unearned revenue  the effects of lifo accounting for inventory  and unallocated general and corporate costs 
our chief operating decision maker uses segment ebit to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments 
a reconciliation of segment ebit to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliated companies is set forth within this section 
the term lifo includes two factors i the impact of current inventory costs being recognized immediately in cost of goods sold cogs under a last in first out method  compared to the older costs that would have been included in cogs under a first in first out method cogs impact  and ii the impact of reductions in inventory quantities  causing historical inventory costs to flow through cogs liquidation impact 
the term contract lag refers to the time lag of the feedstock related pricing adjustments in certain of our rubber blacks supply contracts 
the term product mix refers to the various types and grades  or mix  of products sold in a particular business or segment during the period  and the positive or negative impact of that mix on the revenue or profitability of the business or segment 
the discussion under the heading provision for income taxes includes a discussion of our operating tax rate 
in calculating our operating tax rate which is intended to provide the best metric of the company s on going tax rate  we exclude from the recorded tax provision i discrete tax items  which are unusual or infrequent  and ii the tax impact of certain items 
for this calculation  pretax income from continuing operations is also adjusted to exclude the impact of certain items 
cabot is organized into four business segments the core segment  the performance segment  the new business segment and the specialty fluids segment 
cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions the americas  europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific 
discussions of all periods reflect these structures 
financial results in all periods have been recast to conform to changes made to income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax for our supermetals business and our segment reporting structure 
the segment reporting structure changes include the reclassification of i the cabot elastomer composites business from the rubber blacks business to the new business segment  ii corporate business development costs related to new technology efforts from the new business segment to unallocated corporate costs  iii the cogs impact from lifo accounting from the rubber blacks business and performance segment to general unallocated expense income  and iv corporate overhead costs that had been allocated to the supermetals business to the remaining segments 
our analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended september drivers of demand and key factors affecting profitability drivers of demand and key factors affecting our profitability differ by segment 
in our core segment  demand in the rubber blacks business is influenced on a long term basis primarily by i the number of vehicle miles driven globally  ii the number of original equipment and replacement tires produced  and iii the number of automotive builds 
over the past several years  the rubber blacks business operating results 
table of contents have been driven by a number of factors  including i increases or decreases in sales volumes  ii changes in raw material costs and our ability to obtain sales price increases for our products commensurate with increases in raw material costs  iii changes in pricing and product mix  iv global and regional capacity utilization  v fixed cost savings achieved through restructuring and other cost saving activities  vi the growth of our volumes and market position in emerging economies  and vii capacity management and technology investments  including the impact of energy utilization and yield improvement technologies at our manufacturing facilities 
historically  there has been a time lag between when we incur feedstock costs and the time when prices are adjusted under our supply contracts that contain feedstock related pricing formulas 
since  we have been actively renegotiating these contracts in an attempt to reduce this time delay 
however  during fiscal  we still had contracts with a time delay in the pricing adjustment and  therefore  experienced an unfavorable impact to segment ebit 
during fiscal  we reduced the percentage of volume subject to this time lag  and the financial impact of the time lag was immaterial to our business results in fiscal and fiscal in our performance segment  longer term demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure  automotive  electronics and consumer products industries 
in recent years  operating results in the performance segment have been driven by i our growth in emerging markets  ii our ability to deliver differentiated products that drive enhanced performance in customers applications  and iii our ability to obtain value pricing for this differentiation 
in our new business segment  drivers of demand are specific to the various businesses 
in the inkjet colorants business  demand has been driven by a relative increase of printer platforms using our pigments at both new and existing customers and the broader adoption of inkjet technology in office and commercial printing applications 
demand in the aerogel business has been driven by the adoption of aerogel products for oil and gas  daylighting  insulation for building and construction and specialty chemical applications 
in the cabot superior micropowders business  demand has been driven principally by the number of security taggant applications incorporating our unique and proprietary particles 
in the cabot elastomer composites business  demand has been driven by the penetration of our unique compound of natural rubber and carbon black made in a patented liquid phase into applications for the tire  mining and defense industries 
operating results in the new business segment have been influenced by i our ability to improve the pace of revenue generation in the segment  ii our ability to select the highest value opportunities and work with lead users in the appropriate markets  iii our ability to appropriately size the overall cost platform of the segment for the opportunities  and iv the timing of milestone payments in our cabot elastomer composites business 
in our specialty fluids segment  demand for cesium formate is primarily driven by the level of drilling activity for high pressure oil and gas wells and by the petroleum industry s acceptance of our product as a drilling and completion fluid for this application 
operating results in the specialty fluids segment have been driven by the size  type and duration of drilling jobs 
overview of results for fiscal during fiscal  profitability increased compared to fiscal driven by improved pricing and product mix and benefits from investments in energy centers and yield technology 
during fiscal  we entered into an agreement to divest our supermetals business 
as such  operating results from the supermetals business are included in income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented on the consolidated statements of operations and the assets and liabilities related to this business are categorized as held for sale for all periods presented on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales and gross profit years ended september dollars in millions net sales and other operating revenues gross profit the million increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to higher selling prices and a favorable product mix million and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation million partially offset by lower volumes million 
the million increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to higher volumes million from stronger demand in our key end markets  higher selling prices and a favorable product mix million and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation million 
gross profit increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal principally due to higher unit margins driven by the implementation of strategic value pricing and product mix initiatives and benefits from the investments in energy centers and yield technology that more than offset higher raw material costs 
gross profit increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal principally due to i higher volumes from improved demand in our end markets  ii higher unit margins driven by the implementation of strategic value pricing and product mix initiatives  and iii lower charges recorded as cost of sales during fiscal principally related to restructuring expenses 
while there was a significant contract lag and lifo benefit in fiscal  the impact in fiscal was minimal 
this resulted in an unfavorable year over year comparison for both of these items 
gross profit percentage may be significantly affected by changes in net sales as a result of increases or decreases in prices based on the price adjustment to customers for increases or decreases in raw material costs 
therefore  we do not use gross profit percentage as an indicator of business performance  but instead we focus on gross profit dollar changes from period to period as a better indicator of business performance 
selling and administrative expenses years ended september dollars in millions selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the comparative increase is principally due to increased business and business development activity levels that were partially offset by lower restructuring related expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the comparative increase is principally due to substantially lower spending levels in fiscal from cost saving measures implemented at the onset of the global economic downturn  higher restructuring related charges and an increase in performance based compensation in fiscal commensurate with improved operating results 
research and technical expenses years ended september dollars in millions research and technical expenses research and technical expenses were million higher in fiscal when compared to fiscal as we maintained our investment in new product and process development opportunities across the businesses 
research and technical expenses were lower by million in fiscal when compared to 
table of contents fiscal while maintaining our gross spending levels  we also continued to focus on investing in our highest value new business and process research opportunities during fiscal interest and dividend income years ended september dollars in millions interest and dividend income interest and dividend income was million in both fiscal and interest and dividend income was million lower in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates  partially offset by higher cash balances 
interest expense years ended september dollars in millions interest expense interest expense decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal driven by lower average debt levels in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the comparative increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates resulting from the issuance of our notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal other expense years ended september dollars in millions other expense other expense balances are driven by foreign currency movements  including gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated debt and related derivatives 
the million increase in expense from fiscal to fiscal was principally driven by an unfavorable comparison of these foreign currency movements 
the million decrease in expense from fiscal to fiscal was driven by a favorable comparison of these foreign currency movements  which included the write down in fiscal of the value of bolivars that had accumulated in our holding companies over several years to a parallel exchange rate million 
provision benefit for income taxes years ended september dollars in millions provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate in calculating our operating tax rate  we exclude discrete tax items and the impact of certain items on both operating income and the tax provision 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  resulting in an overall tax rate 
this amount included discrete tax benefits of million comprised of i million related to the repatriation of high tax income in response to recent changes in us tax legislation  ii million from audit settlements  iii million from the recognition of investment tax credits in china  and iv million from the renewal of the us research and experimentation r e credit 
the operating tax rate for fiscal was 

table of contents the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  resulting in an overall tax rate

the benefit for income taxes was million for fiscal  resulting in an overall tax rate 
this amount included discrete tax benefits of million comprised of i million from audit settlements  ii million for the renewal of the us r e credit  and iii million for investment incentive credits earned 
however  the operating tax rate for fiscal was a charge of due to the fact that the losses for which no tax benefit could be recorded were disproportionately high compared to overall income for the year

income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax during fiscal  we entered into an agreement to divest our supermetals business 
as such  we have reclassified income from continuing operations related to the supermetals business to income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for each of the last three fiscal years 
the million increase in income from discontinued operations from fiscal to fiscal was driven by an increase in profitability of the supermetals business as a result of improved pricing and product mix 
the million increase in income from discontinued operations from fiscal to fiscal was driven by an increase in profitability of the supermetals business as a result of higher volumes and lower raw material costs

this resulted in an unfavorable year over year comparison million 
historically  our rubber blacks supply contracts have provided for a price adjustment on the first day of each quarter to account for changes in feedstock related costs and  in some cases  changes in other relevant costs 
these feedstock adjustments were based upon the average of a relevant index over a three month period  and the contracts typically provided for the adjustments to be calculated in the month preceding the quarter 
accordingly  the calculation was typically based upon the average of the three months preceding the month in which the calculation was made 
in periods of rapidly fluctuating feedstock costs  this time lag could have a significant impact on the results of the rubber blacks segment 
over the past three years  we have reduced the percentage of our rubber blacks volume subject to this time delay from approximately in fiscal to less than at the end of fiscal to an insignificant amount at the end of fiscal accordingly  we anticipate that the contract lag comparisons discussed above will not be a factor in our operating results in the future

revenue increases were driven by higher volumes in the inkjet colorants business and sales of security taggants and incremental revenue resulting from the acquisition of oxonica materials inc in the cabot superior micropowders business 
sales in the new business segment increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal  with commercial revenue increases in all businesses within the segment and higher revenues from joint development and licensing agreements 
the commercial revenue improvements were driven by higher volumes in the inkjet colorants business  an increased number of jobs in oil and gas applications in the aerogel business  increased sales of security taggants for brand authentication in the cabot superior micropowders business  and the timing of payments associated with certain milestones in our cabot elastomer composites business

specialty fluids segment sales and ebit for the specialty fluids segment for fiscal  and are as follows years ended september dollars in millions segment sales segment ebit 
table of contents during fiscal  sales in the specialty fluids segment were million lower than in fiscal the decrease was principally due to a less favorable mix of business  including jobs that were smaller and shorter in duration 
during fiscal  sales in the specialty fluids segment were million higher than in fiscal the increase was due principally to a higher level of drilling activity in the north sea and higher prices 
fiscal ebit decreased by million when compared to fiscal the decrease was principally due to a less favorable mix of business  including jobs that were smaller and shorter in duration 
fiscal ebit increased by million when compared to fiscal the increase was driven by higher volumes from a strong level of drilling activity in the north sea and higher pricing 
these favorable factors were partially offset by increased operating expenses from the restart of our manufacturing facility in manitoba  canada after a temporary suspension of production activity in fiscal cash flows and liquidity overview as permitted by us gaap  our consolidated statements of cash flows have been presented to include discontinued operations with continuing operations 
therefore  unless noted otherwise  the following discussion of our cash flows and liquidity position include both continuing and discontinued operations 
our liquidity position  as measured by cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing availability  decreased by million during fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to our decreased cash position  which was offset by an increase in our committed borrowing facilities 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and current availability under our revolving credit agreement of approximately million 
in august  we entered into a new committed unsecured revolving credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility through august and replaced our previous credit facility which was scheduled to expire in june the credit agreement contains an option  subject to the lenders approval  to increase the facility to million 
all borrowing under the credit agreement will be based on variable interest rates 
amounts committed under the credit agreement can also be utilized to provide letters of credit in certain circumstances 
we plan to use the credit agreement for general corporate purposes  which may include working capital  refinancing existing indebtedness  capital expenditures  share repurchases  and acquisitions 
the credit agreement contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type 
the financial covenants in the credit agreement include interest coverage  debt to ebitda and subsidiary debt to total capitalization ratios 
as of september   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
we anticipate sufficient liquidity from i cash on hand  ii cash flows from operating activities  and iii cash available from our credit agreement to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
our liquidity derived from cash flows from operations is  to a large degree  predicated on our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  the cost of our raw materials  and our ability to manage inventory levels 
we generally manage our cash and debt on a global basis to provide for working capital and capital expenditure requirements as needed by region or site 
cash and debt are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary holding the assets or liabilities  except where there are operational cash flow reasons to hold non functional cash or debt 
as of september  our usd equivalent holdings by region were asia pacific million  europe million  and the americas million  which included million in the us the following discussion of the changes in our cash balance refers to the various sections of our consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash generated by operating activities  which consists of net income adjusted for the various non cash items included in income  changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts  totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash generated from operating activities in fiscal was driven primarily by net income of million plus million of depreciation and amortization and million of non cash compensation  partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million inventories plus accounts and notes receivable  less accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our working capital increase in fiscal was driven principally by higher pricing and raw material costs when compared to fiscal and is comprised of higher accounts receivable million and inventories million  offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities million 
despite increased revenue  operating cash flows decreased in fiscal as a result of the corresponding growth of inventories  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
cash generated from operating activities in fiscal was driven primarily by net income of million plus million of depreciation and amortization and million of non cash compensation  partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million 
our working capital increase in fiscal was driven principally by higher sales volumes when compared to fiscal and is comprised of higher accounts receivable million and inventories million  offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities million 
cash generated from operating activities in fiscal was due principally to a net decrease in working capital of million 
specifically  we had both a million decrease in accounts receivable primarily attributable to lower sales and improved collections and a decrease of million in inventories as a result of lower feedstock costs and reduced inventory quantities 
offsetting these sources of cash was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million as a result of the timing of raw material deliveries and payments 
in addition to the working capital movements noted above  the following other elements of operations have had a bearing on operating cash flows discontinued operations fiscal cash flows provided by operating activities include cash flows of million related to the supermetals business 
these operating cash flows were primarily driven by million of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  plus approximately million of deferred tax provision and approximately million of depreciation and amortization 
restructurings as of september   we had million of total restructuring costs in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet related to our global restructuring activities 
we made cash payments of million during fiscal related to these restructuring plans 
we expect to make cash payments related to these restructuring activities of approximately million in fiscal and million thereafter which includes the million already accrued in the consolidated balance sheet as of september  
environmental reserves and litigation matters we have recorded a million reserve on both a discounted and undiscounted basis as of september  for environmental remediation costs at various sites 
these sites are primarily associated with businesses divested in prior years 
we anticipate that the expenditures at these sites will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any one year 
additionally  as of september  we have recorded an million reserve on a discounted basis million on an undiscounted basis for respirator claims 
these expenditures will also be incurred over several years 
we also have other litigation costs arising in the ordinary course of business 

table of contents the following table represents the estimated future undiscounted payments related to our environmental and respirator reserves 
future payments by fiscal year thereafter total dollars in millions environmental litigation respirator total we expect that cash on hand and cash provided from operations will be adequate to fund any cash requirements relating to environmental matters or pending litigation costs 
operating activities other venezuela we own of an operating affiliate in venezuela  which is accounted for as an equity affiliate  through our wholly owned subsidiaries that carry the investment and receive its dividends 
as of september  these subsidiaries carried the operating affiliate investment of million  and held million bolivars million in cash and dividends receivable 
an inability to convert the operating affiliate s earnings into us dollars would be considered an indicator of impairment  requiring a full impairment analysis of our investment and  therefore  we closely monitor our ability to convert our bolivar holdings into us dollars 
the venezuelan bolivar may only be exchanged for foreign currencies through certain venezuelan government controlled channels 
the channels available are the venezuelan central bank cadivi  venezuelan government and government backed bond offerings or an officially sanctioned and regulated secondary market sitme 
sitme is subject to restrictions which preclude us from utilizing this market to remit dividends 
the bond issuance process uses a bidding process  where companies and individuals requiring us dollars place a request for a fixed sum  and cadivi then determines how to allocate out the pool of us dollars in that issuance 
during fiscal  the operating affiliate declared a dividend of million bolivars to our wholly owned subsidiaries  of which million bolivars was paid in us dollars at an exchange rate of bolivars to the us dollar b 
we also participated in various bond offerings during fiscal  repatriating approximately million bolivars at a rate of b  which resulted in an exchange loss of less than million  recognized in the first quarter of fiscal these transactions indicate that there continue to be available mechanisms to convert the operating affiliate s earnings to us dollars and  therefore  we continue to use the cadivi official rate of b to remeasure our bolivar balances 
we still intend to convert substantially all bolivars held by our venezuelan subsidiaries to us dollars as soon as practical and we continue to monitor for opportunities to convert their bolivars through venezuelan government  or government backed  bond offerings 
any future change in the cadivi official rate or opening of additional parallel markets could lead us to use a different exchange rate and result in gains or losses on our bolivar denominated assets held by our subsidiaries 
employee benefit plans as of september  we had a consolidated pension obligation  net of the fair value of plan assets  of million  comprised of million for pension benefit plan liabilities and million for postretirement benefit plan liabilities 

table of contents the million of underfunded pension benefit plan liabilities is derived as follows us foreign total dollars in millions fair value of plan assets benefit obligation funded status in fiscal  we made cash contributions totaling approximately million to our foreign pension benefit plans and none to our us pension plan 
for fiscal  we expect to make cash contributions of approximately million to our us pension plan and approximately million to our foreign pension plans 
the million of unfunded postretirement benefit plan liabilities is comprised of million for our us and million for our foreign postretirement benefit plans 
these postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
typical of such plans  our postretirement plans are unfunded and  therefore  have no plan assets 
we fund these plans as claims or insurance premiums come due 
in fiscal  we paid postretirement benefits of million under our us postretirement plans and less than million under our foreign postretirement plans 
for fiscal  we expect to make benefit payments of approximately million under our us postretirement plans and million under our foreign postretirement plans 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities were primarily driven by capital expenditures and consumed million of cash in fiscal compared to million of cash in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal of million were primarily related to sustaining and replacement capital for our operating facilities  investments in energy recovery technology  expansion of our manufacturing footprint in the asia pacific region and capital spending required for process technology and product differentiation projects 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal includes approximately million of additions to property  plant and equipment in the supermetals business 
capital expenditures in fiscal of million were primarily related to sustaining and replacement capital for our operating facilities  investments in energy recovery technology  the completion of our newly commissioned masterbatch facility in dubai  expansion of our manufacturing footprint in the asia pacific region and capital spending required for process technology and product differentiation projects 
capital expenditures in fiscal of million included spending for expansion of rubber blacks capacity at an existing facility in china  new energy centers at other rubber blacks facilities and a new facility in dubai 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between million to million 
our planned capital spending program for fiscal is primarily for higher spending for ongoing sustaining and replacement capital as well as investments in energy related projects and capacity expansions 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities consumed million of cash in fiscal compared to million of cash in fiscal and million in fiscal in each year  financing cash flows were primarily driven by changes in debt levels and dividend payments 
in addition  in fiscal we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock on the open market 
the supermetals business did not have significant cash flows from financing activities in fiscal

in fiscal  net proceeds from certain short term financing arrangements totaled million  offset by long term debt repayments of million 
in fiscal  because of our strong operating cash flows and the proceeds obtained in fiscal from the issuance of the notes due in  we had little movement in financing cash flows apart from our on going dividend payments to our shareholders 
in fiscal  we issued notes due in and repaid other debt 
we had million of availability under our credit agreement as of september  our long term total debt  of which million is current  matures at various times over the next twenty seven years 
the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate long term debt was  including the effects of the interest rate swaps 
the weighted average interest rate on variable interest rate long term debt was as of september   including the effects of the interest rate swaps 
at september   we have provided standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling million  which expire throughout fiscal share repurchases during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as of september   we had approximately million shares available for repurchase under the board of directors share repurchase authorization 
we also repurchased shares of our common stock with an aggregate market value of million from employees to facilitate their payment of taxes and associated loan repayment obligations due on the vesting of long term incentive awards 
dividend payments in each of fiscal  and  we paid cash dividends on our common stock of per share 
these cash dividend payments totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we had no material transactions that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our long term contractual obligations  excluding those attributable to our discontinued operations  which are described in greater detail in note t in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item variable interest is based on the variable debt outstanding and prevailing variable interest rates as of september   and the table includes the impact of our interest rate swaps that change fixed rates to floating rates

capital lease obligations includes million for a lease committed to in fiscal as the lease agreement is not effective until fiscal purchase commitments we have entered into long term  volume based purchase agreements primarily for the purchase of raw materials and natural gas with various key suppliers in our core and performance segments 
under certain of these agreements the quantity of material being purchased is fixed  but the price we pay changes as market prices change 
for purposes of the table above  current purchase prices have been used to quantify total commitments 
operating leases we have operating leases primarily comprised of leases for transportation vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  and machinery and equipment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through long and short term borrowings and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies 
changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flows and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have policies governing our use of derivative instruments  and we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
the derivative instruments are booked to our balance sheet at fair market value and reflect the asset or liability position as of 
table of contents september  if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our exposure will equal the fair value of the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a payment risk for cabot 
we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into these transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating 
as of september   the counterparties that we have executed derivatives with were rated between a and aa  inclusive  by standard and poor s 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 
interest rate risk as of september   we had long term debt  including the current portion  totaling million  which has both variable and fixed interest rate components 
we have entered into interest rate swaps as a hedge to a portion of our underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without changing the debt instrument 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as most of our long term debt was issued at fixed rates  we use interest rate swaps as a means to achieve a different fixed to floating interest rate mix 
the table below summarizes the principal terms of our interest rate swap transactions  including the notional amount of the swap  the interest rate payment we receive from and pay to our swap counterparty  the term of the transaction  and its fair value at september  description notional amount receive pay fiscal year entered into maturity fiscal year fair market value at september  asset liability usd interest rate swaps fixed to variable usd million fixed us month libor million usd million fixed us month libor usd million fixed us month libor usd million fixed us month libor usd million fixed us month libor 
table of contents foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to certain risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations and government actions 
currently  we have issued debt denominated in us dollars and then entered into cross currency swaps that exchange our dollar principal and interest payments into a currency where we expect long term  stable cash receipts 
the following table summarizes the principal terms of our long term foreign currency swap transactions  including the notional amount of the swap  the interest rate payment we receive from and pay to our swap counterparty  the term of the transaction and its fair market value at september  description net notional amount receive pay fiscal year entered into maturity year fair market value at september  usd cross currency swaps usd million swapped to eur million fixed fixed million usd million swapped to eur million us month libor eur month libor million foreign currency exposures also relate to assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary as well as the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows generated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we use short term forward contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk 
these forward contracts typically have a duration of days 
at september   we had million in net notional foreign currency contracts  which were denominated in the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  euro  and japanese yen 
these forwards had a fair value of million as of september  of the million in net notional foreign currency contracts  million related to contracts denominated in japanese yen which were designated as a fair value hedge 
these hedge contracts had a fair value of million at september  in certain situations where we have a long term commitment denominated in a foreign currency we may enter into appropriate financial instruments in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge future cash flow exposures 
commodity risk certain of our carbon black plants in europe are subject to mandatory greenhouse gas emission trading schemes 
our objective is to ensure compliance with the european union emission trading scheme  which is based upon a cap and trade system that establishes a maximum allowable emission credit for each ton of co emitted 
european union allowances eua originate from the individual eu member state s country allocation process and are issued by that country s government 
a company that has an excess of euas based on the co emissions limits may sell euas in the emission trading scheme and if they have a shortfall  a company can buy euas or certified emission reduction cer units to comply 
in order to limit the variability in cost to our european operations  we purchased cers and sold euas which settle each december until the following table provides details of the derivatives held as of september  used to manage commodity risk
