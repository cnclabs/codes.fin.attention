executive summary through our interest in douglas emmett properties  lp our operating partnership and its subsidiaries  including our investments in unconsolidated institutional real estate funds funds we partially own and manage  we own or partially own  manage  lease  acquire and develop real estate  consisting primarily of office and multifamily properties 
as of december   we owned a consolidated portfolio of class a office properties including ancillary retail space with approximately million rentable square feet and nine multifamily properties with a total of  units  as well as the fee interests in two parcels of land subject to ground leases 
our total office portfolio  which includes our consolidated office properties and the seven class a office properties owned by the funds we manage and in which we invested an average of of the total capital  consisted of office properties with approximately million rentable square feet 
as of december   our consolidated office portfolio was leased  our total office portfolio including properties owned by our funds and our operating partnership was leased and our multifamily properties were leased 
our consolidated office portfolio contributed approximately of our annualized rent during  while our multifamily portfolio contributed the remaining 
during  our los angeles county office and multifamily consolidated portfolio contributed approximately of our annualized rent  and our honolulu  hawaii office and multifamily consolidated portfolio contributed the remaining 
our properties are concentrated in nine premier los angeles county submarkets brentwood  olympic corridor  century city  santa monica  beverly hills  westwood  sherman oaks encino  warner cent er woodland hills and burbank as well as in honolulu  hawaii 
current year acquisitions  dispositions  repositionings and financings 
acquisitions 
in june  we acquired bishop square  an office project containing approximately  square feet located in honolulu  hawaii  for a contract price of million 
bishop square is the largest office project in the state of hawaii and consists of two class a office towers  an above ground parking structure and a one acre park 
in october  one of our unconsolidated funds acquired wilshire bundy plaza 
this property contains approximately  square feet  is located in our brentwood submarket along the wilshire corridor  and was acquired for a contract price of million 
dispositions 
during  we had no property dispositions 
repositionings 
we generally select a property for repositioning at the time we purchase it 
we often strategically purchase properties with large vacancies or expected near term lease roll over and use our knowledge of the property and submarket to determine the optimal use and tenant mix 
a repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property 
a repositioning may involve a complete structural renovation of a building to significantly upgrade the character of the property  or it may involve targeted remodeling of common areas and tenant spaces to make the property more attractive to certain identified tenants 
because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property  tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket  the results are varying degrees of depressed rental revenue and occupancy levels for the affected property  which impacts our results and  accordingly  comparisons of our performance from period to period 
the repositioning process generally occurs over the course of months or even years 
although usually associated with newly acquired properties  repositioning efforts can also occur at properties we already own  therefore repositioning properties discussed in the context of this paragraph exclude acquisition properties where the plan for improvement is implemented as part of the acquisition 
during  we had no properties that qualify as repositioning properties 
financings 
in september  we obtained a secured non recourse million term loan 
this loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to one month libor plus basis points  however we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fix the interest rate at based on an actual day basis until july  this loan facility matures on october  the loan proceeds fully repaid all outstanding borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility  which was then terminated 
in november  we obtained four cross collateralized  ten year term loans totaling million 
the loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to one month libor plus basis points  however  we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fix the interest rate at approximately for seven years expiring on november  the loans mature on november  the loan proceeds fully repaid four loans totaling million that were scheduled to mature on june  we also terminated the existing interest rate swap contracts related to the repaid loans that were scheduled to mature on august  subsequent to the current reporting period  in january  we modified and extended the maturity of our million loan which was scheduled to mature on march  the modified loan has an outstanding balance of million  and bears interest at a floating rate equal to one month libor plus basis points 
the modified loan matures on march  subsequent to the current reporting period  in february  we obtained a secured  non recourse million term loan 
this loan has a maturity date of march   including two one year extension options 
the loan bears interest at a fixed interest rate of until march  and a floating interest rate thereafter 
monthly loan payments are interest only for the first three years with principal amortization thereafter based upon a year amortization schedule 
the loan proceeds were used to fully repay a million term loan  which is one of the seven term loans aggregating billion that mature on august  the balance of the loan proceeds will be retained for other corporate opportunities 
results of operations and basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for the three years ended december   and are the consolidated financial statements of douglas emmett  inc and our subsidiaries including our operating partnership 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
the comparability of our results of operations between  and is affected by acquisitions in all years presented 
this includes the acquisition of seven office properties during and one additional office property we acquired during the second quarter of six of the seven properties acquired in were contributed subsequently to a fund and were removed from our consolidated results at the end of february when the fund was deconsolidated  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
beginning in february  we have accounted for our interest in our funds under the equity method 
the majority of the fluctuation in our results when comparing to is explained by the inclusion of these six properties in our consolidated results for the nine months subsequent to their acquisition in comparison to only two months of  before they were removed from our consolidated results 
similarly  the majority of the fluctuation in our results when comparing to is explained by results of operations of the new office property we acquired in the second quarter of and the inclusion of the six properties in our consolidated results for the two months of  before they were removed from our consolidated results 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues rental revenue 
rental revenue includes rental revenues from our office properties  percentage rent on the retail space contained within office properties  and lease termination income 
total office rental revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million of rent reflected in our consolidated results from the six properties we contributed to the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february  as well as a decrease of million for the remainder of our portfolio  partially offset by million of incremental rent from the property we acquired during the second quarter of the million decrease for the remaind er of our portfolio is primarily due to lower accretion of net below market rents and decreases in occupancy and rental rates 
tenant recoveries 
total office tenant recoveries increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to incremental revenue of million from the property we acquired during and million from the remainder of our portfolio  partially offset by million of recoveries reflected in our consolidated results from the six properties we contributed to the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february the increase for the remainder of our portfolio is primarily due to the completion of common area management cam reconciliations during and the corresponding recognition of incremental amounts due 
parking and other income 
total office parking and other income increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to million of incremental revenue from the property we acquired during  partially offset by million of parking income reflected in our consolidated results from the six properties we contributed to the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february  as well as decreases in parking and other income of million for the remainder of our portfolio as a result of lower occupancy and usage 
operating expenses office rental expenses 
total office rental expense increased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily due to million of incremental expense from the property we acquired during  partially offset by million in office rental expenses reflected in our consolidated results from the six properties we contributed to the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february office rental expense was essentially flat for the remainder of our portfolio 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily due to the cost of our multi year equity grants that were announced during the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million in depreciation and amortization reflected in our consolidated results from the six properties in the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february and million for the remainder of our portfolio due to certain assets being fully depreciated  partially offset by million of incremental depreciation from the property we acquired during non operating income and expenses gain on disposition of interest in unconsolidated real estate fund 
in february  we recorded a gain of million related to the six properties previously contributed to one of our funds that was deconsolidated in february  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income loss 
other income loss in reflects a net income of million  which includes million of net profit generated by our management of the properties owned by our unconsolidated funds as well as million of interest income 
other income loss reflects a net loss in which represents the allocation to outside ownership interest of profit generated by the six properties we contributed to the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february  net of the profit generated by our management of those properties during the ten months of following deconsolidation 
loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate funds 
the loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate funds totaled a net loss of million for this amount represents our equity interest in the operating results from our funds  including the operating income net of historical cost basis depreciation  for the full year 
for  the loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate funds totaled a net loss of million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for this decrease is primarily due to the expiration of various interest rate swaps during the third and fourth quarters of  which caused billion of our variable rate debt to no longer have corresponding swap payments at a higher fixed rate in exchange for lower variable interest 
additionally  as a result of the natural expiration and early termination of approximately billion of our pre ipo swaps  there was lower non cash interest expense from the amortization of these interest rate swaps 
the decrease is partially offset by the amortization of other comprehensive income resulting from the early termination of our cash flow swaps 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue office revenue rental revenue 
total office rental revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of million in rent in compared to resulting from the deconsolidation at the end of february of the six properties we contributed to a fund  partially offset by increases totaling million for the remainder of our portfolio 
the increase of million was a result of rate increases for new and renewal tenants  partially offset by lower occupancy 
tenant recoveries 
total office tenant recoveries decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of million in recoveries in compared to resulting from the deconsolidation at the end of february of the six properties we contributed to a fund  partially offset by an increase in recoverable tenant direct expenses 
parking and other income 
total office parking and other income decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of million in parking income in compared to resulting from the deconsolidation at the end of february of the six properties we contributed to a fund  as well as a decrease of million for the remainder of our portfolio as a result of lower occupancy and usage 
total multifamily revenue 
total multifamily revenue decreased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to lower recognition of rental income during from the amortization of below market leases for certain multifamily units initially recorded at the time of our ipo  thus causing a decline when comparing the and periods  as well as a decline in rental rates for the comparable periods 
operating expenses office rental expenses 
total office rental expense decreased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of million in office rental expenses in compared to resulting from the six properties we contributed to the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february  partially offset by an increase in office rental expenses in the remainder of our portfolio 
other office expenses increased by million primarily as a result of lower comparable property tax accruals in the prior year  partially offset by lower janitorial costs and ground rent payments in the current year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily due to the timing of accruals related to compensation  including equity awards that are expensed over the multi year vesting period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of million in depreciation and amortization reflected in compared to resulting from the deconsolidation at the end of february of the six properties we contributed to a fund 
non operating income and expenses gain on disposition of interest in unconsolidated real estate fund 
in february  we recorded a gain of million related to six properties that were previously contributed to one of our funds that was deconsolidated in february  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income loss 
other income loss reflects a net loss in which represents the allocation to outside ownership interest of profit generated by the six properties during the two months of prior to their deconsolidation  net of the profit generated by our management of the properties during the ten months of following its deconsolidation 
in contrast  the other income loss in reflects a net gain of million  which includes million of profit sharing resulting from our initial contribution of the six properties to that fund in october  as well as million of operating profit related to the temporary operation of the honolulu athletic club during loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate funds 
the loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate funds totaled million for the loss represents our equity interest in the operating results from our fund following its deconsolidation at the end of february  including the operating income net of historical cost basis depreciation 
during  there was no comparable amount recorded because the operating results for the six properties were included in our consolidated results 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease over comparable periods is primarily due to lower levels of outstanding debt during as a result of the deconsolidation of debt associated with the six properties we contributed to the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february  and a decrease in the utilization of our revolving credit facility which had no outstanding borrowings for the majority of the decrease is partially offset by additional interest expense as a result of higher non cash interest expense from the amortization of pre ipo interest rate swap contracts 
liquidity and capital resources available borrowings  cash balances and capital resources we had total indebtedness of billion at december   excluding a loan premium representing the mark to market adjustment on variable rate debt assumed from our ipo 
this amount includes a new seven year million term loan agreement entered into during the third quarter of  secured by seven properties  including the one property acquired in the second quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we have typically financed our capital needs through short term lines of credit and long term secured mortgages at floating rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flows from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements with respect to our long term secured mortgages 
during the third quarter and fourth quarter of  certain of our fixed rate swaps matured  and no longer hedge the floating rate interest payments on a notional billion of our debt 
at december   billion or of our debt was effectively fixed at an overall rate of on an actual day basis by virtue of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements in place at the end of the reporting period 
see item a of this report for a description of the impact of variable rates on our interest expense 
see also note and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
as of december   only one loan was scheduled to mature in months or less 
this million secured loan was scheduled to mature on march  subsequent to december   the maturity of this loan was extended to march  of the remaining billion of debt  billion in term loans mature on august  we are seeking to refinance our loans that have maturities during the first half of our goal is to ladder our loan maturities so that they range between five and ten years by accessing life companies  domestic and foreign banks  and the residential agency market 
at december   our billion of borrowings under secured loans represented of our total market capitalization of billion 
total market capitalization includes our consolidated debt and the value of common stock and operating partnership units  each based on our common stock closing price at december  on the new york stock exchange of per share 
we expect to meet our operating liquidity requirements generally through cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
excluding any acquisitions and debt refinancings  we anticipate that cash on hand and provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions  redevelopment and repositioning of properties  non recurring capital expenditures  and repayment of indebtedness at maturity 
we do not expect that we will have sufficient funds on hand to cover all of these long term cash requirements 
the nature of our business  and the requirements imposed by reit rules that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis  may cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over the long term 
in  we declared an annual dividend of per share  paid quarterly following the end of each quarter 
we will seek to satisfy our long term liquidity needs through cash flows from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance o f debt and equity securities  including units in our operating partnership  property dispositions and joint venture transactions 
we have historically financed our operations  acquisitions and development  through long term secured floating rate mortgage debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flows from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements at the time we enter into term borrowings 
commitments the following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter long term debt obligations minimum lease payments remaining capital commitment to unconsolidated real estate funds purchase commitments related to capital expenditures associated with tenant improvements and repositioning and other purchase obligations total includes million of debt carried by the honolulu club joint venture in which we held a interest 
because there is not an explicit date for when our remaining capital commitment will be called  we reflect the entire commitment in the earliest category 
off balance sheet arrangements we have established and manage unconsolidated real estate funds through which institutional investors provide capital commitments for acquisition of properties 
the capital we invest in our funds is invested on a pari passu basis with the other investors 
in addition  we also receive certain additional distributions based on committed capital and on any profits that exceed certain specified cash returns to the investors 
we do not expect to receive additional significant liquidity from our investments in our funds until the disposition of the properties held by the relevant fund  which may not be for many years 
certain of our wholly owned affiliates provide property management and other services with respect to the real estate owned by our funds for which we are paid fees and or reimburs ed our costs 
at december   our funds had obtained capital commitments of million  of which million remained undrawn 
this amount included commitments from us of million  of which million remained undrawn 
we do not have any debt outstanding in connection with our interest in our funds 
each of our funds may have its own debt  secured by the properties it owns 
the following table summarizes the debt of our institutional funds at december  type of debt principal balance in millions maturity date variable rate fixed rate swap maturity date variable rate term loan swapped to fixed rate libor fixed rate term loan n a n a the loan is secured by six properties in a collateralized pool 
requires monthly payments of interest only  with outstanding principal due upon maturity 
we transferred this loan to one of our funds during the fourth quarter of when we contributed the properties securing it to that fund 
we remain responsible under certain environmental and other limited indemnities and guarantees covering customary non recourse carve outs under this loan  which we entered into prior to our contribution of this debt and the related properties  although we have an indemnity from that fund for any amounts we would be required to pay under these agreements 
if that fund fails to perform any obligations under a swap agreement related to this loan  we remain liable to the swap counterparties 
the maximum future payments under the swap agreements were approximately million as of december  to date  all obligations under the swap agreements have been performed by that fund in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
effective annual rate including the effect of interest rate contracts 
based on actual day basis and excludes amortization of loan fees 
assumed by one of our funds 
requires monthly payments of principal and interest 
cash flows our cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
our cash flows from operating activities is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio  the rental rates achieved on our leases  the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating expenses and other general and administrative costs 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to incremental cash flows from the property we acquired during the second quarter of as well as lower cash interest paid due to the expiration during of swaps totaling billion  which caused a portion of our variable rate debt to no longer require corresponding swap payments at a higher fixed rate 
the increase is partially offset by lower cash flows from our same property portfolio and the deconsolidation at the end of february of the cash flows from the six properties contributed to a fund we manage 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our net cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions  development and redevelopment projects recurring and non recurring capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for compared to million for the increase was attributable to the acquisition of a property during see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our net cash related to financing activities is generally impacted by our borrowings  capital activities net of dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests 
net cash flows from financing activities amounted to a net provision of cash for totaling million compared to a net use of cash for totaling million 
the comparative difference was primarily due to a million term loan borrowing during  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  in contrast to the repayment of outstanding revolver borrowings in critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of douglas emmett  inc and our predecessor are based upon their respective consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates of certain items and judgments as to certain future events  for example with respect to the allocation of the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings  improvements  equipment  and any related intangible assets and liabilities 
these determinations  even though inherently subjective and subject to change  affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
while we believe that o ur estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time they are made  some of our assumptions  estimates and judgments will inevitably prove to be incorrect 
as a result  actual outcomes will likely differ from our accruals  and those differences positive or negative could be material 
some of our accruals are subject to adjustment as we believe appropriate based on revised estimates and reconciliation to the actual results when available 
for a discussion of recently issued accounting literature  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
investment in real estate 
acquisitions of properties and other business combinations are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of acquired properties are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
beginning january   transaction costs related to acquisitions are expensed  rather than included with the consideration paid 
estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land  buildings and improvements  equipment and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in place at market leases  acquired above and below market leases and tenant relationsh ips 
initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized no later than months from the acquisition date 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment  and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases 
the fair values of tangible assets are determined on an as if vacant basis 
the as if vacant fair value is allocated to land  where applicable  buildings  tenant improvements and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 
the estimated fair value of acquired in place at market leases are the costs we would have incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition 
such estimates include the fair value of leasing commissions and legal costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this occupancy level 
additionally  we evaluate the time period over which such occupancy level would be achieved and we include an estimate of the net operating costs primarily real estate taxes  insurance and utilities incurred during the lease up period  which is generally six months 
above market and below market in place lease values are recorded as an asset or liability based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received or paid pursuant to the in place tenant or ground leases  respectively  and our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed to operations as incurred 
significant improvements are capitalized 
interest  insurance and property tax costs incurred during the period of construction of real estate facilities are capitalized 
when assets are sold or retired  their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period 
the values allocated to land  buildings  site improvements  in place leases and tenant improvements are depreciated on a straight line basis using an estimated life of years for buildings  years for site improvements  the average term of existing leases in the building acquired for in place lease values and the respective remaining lease terms for tenant improvements and leasing costs 
the values of above and below market tenant leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market tenant leases or a decrease for above market tenant leases to rental income 
the value of above and below market ground leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market ground leases or a decre ase for above market ground leases to office rental operating expense 
the amortization of acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of an investment in real estate or an investment in an unconsolidated real estate fund  an impairment loss is recorded to t he extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property or equity investment 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
income taxes 
as a reit  we are permitted to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders  eliminating the federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the corporate level 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
revenue recognition 
four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all leases are classified as operating leases 
for all lease terms exceeding one year  rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
deferred rent receivables represent rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis in excess of billed rents 
lease termination fees  which are included in rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuin g obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the expenses are incurred 
subsequent to year end  we perform final reconciliations on a lease by lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments 
in addition  we record a capital asset for leasehold improvements constructed by us that are reimbursed by tenants  with the offsetting side of this accounting entry recorded to deferred revenue which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the deferred revenue is amortized as additional rental revenue over the life of the related lease 
rental revenue from month to month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustmen ts is recognized on a monthly basis when earned 
the recognition of gains on sales of real estate requires that we measure the timing of a sale against various criteria related to the terms of the transaction  as well as any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  profit sharing or leasing method 
if the sales criteria have been met  we further analyze whether profit recognition is appropriate using the full accrual method 
if the criteria to recognize profit using the full accrual method have not been met  we defer the gain and recognize it when the criteria are met or use the installment or cost recovery method as appropriate under the circumstances 
monitoring of rents and other receivables 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
we generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants  other than security deposits or letters of credit 
if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
stock based compensation 
we have awarded stock based compensation to certain key employees and members of our board of directors in the form of stock options and long term incentive plan units ltip units 
we estimate the fair value of the awards and recognize this value over the requisite vesting period 
we utilize a black scholes model to calculate the fair value of options  which uses assumptions related to the stock  including volatility and dividend yield  as well as assumptions related to the stock award itself  such as the expected term and estimated forfeiture rate 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions for which we have relied on observations of both historical trends and implied estimates as determined by independent third parties 
for ltip units  the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant and a discount for post vesting restrictions estimated by a third party consultant 
financial instruments 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments are determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in current market exchanges 
interest rate agreements 
we manage our interest rate risk associated with borrowings by obtaining interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts 
no other derivative instruments are used 
we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income  which is a component of our stockholders equity accounts 
 the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
in conjunction with our ipo  we entered into two series of interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts 
the first series effectively offset all future changes in fair value from our existing interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts  and the second series effectively replaced the existing interest rate contracts and qualified for cash flow hedge accounting 
we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their cre dit rating and other factors 
for a description of our interest rate contracts  please see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
at december   approximately billion  or  of our debt was hedged with derivative instruments 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding at december   by virtue of the mitigating effect of our interest rate contracts  a basis point change in libor would result in an annual impact to our earnings of approximately million 
we calculate interest sensitivity by computing the amount of floating rate debt not mitigated by interest rate contracts by the respective change in rate 
the sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration possible changes in the balances or fair value of our floating rate debt 
by using derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk and the potential inability of our counterparties to perform under the terms of the agreements 
we attempt to minimize this credit risk by contracting with high quality bank financial counterparties
