table of contents the company recognizes revenue for products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped  however  occasionally title passes later or earlier than shipment due to customer contracts or letter of credit terms 
if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not or is presumed not to be fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met

revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware  software  and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
each element s allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met 
fair value is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately 
if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement  the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  but fair value exists for the undelivered elements  the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
implementation services include the design  development  testing  and installation of systems 
these services are recognized pursuant to sop  accounting for performance of construction type contracts and certain production type contracts 
in such cases  the company is required to make reasonably dependable estimates relative to the extent of progress toward completion by comparing the total hours incurred to the estimated total hours for the arrangement and  accordingly  would apply the percentage of completion method 
if the company were unable to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress towards completion  then it would use the completed contract method  under which revenue is recognized only upon completion of the services 
if total cost estimates exceed the anticipated revenue  then the estimated loss on the arrangement is recorded at the inception of the arrangement or at the time the loss becomes apparent 
revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the coverage period 
these contracts typically extend phone support  software updates and upgrades  technical support and equipment repairs 
certain products which include software elements that are considered to be more than incidental are sold with post contract support  which may include certain upgrade rights that are offered to customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and maintenance contracts 
the company defers revenue for the fair value of the upgrade rights until the future obligation is fulfilled or the right to the upgrade expires 
when the company s software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis  revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company s policy is to establish  on a quarterly basis  allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical loss trends  credit quality of the 
table of contents present portfolio  collateral value  and general economic conditions 
if the historical loss trend increased or decreased in  the company s operating income would have decreased or increased by million  respectively 
though management considers the valuation of the allowances proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company s customers could affect the reserve balances required 
inventory reserve the company performs ongoing evaluations to ensure that reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are properly identified and recorded 
the reserve balance includes both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves at are established for identifiable obsolete products and materials 
general reserves for materials and finished goods are established based upon formulas which reference  among other things  the level of current inventory relative to recent usage  estimated scrap value  and the level of estimated future usage 
historically  this reserve policy has given a close approximation of the company s experience with excess and obsolete inventory 
the company does not foresee a need to revise its reserve policy in the future 
however  from time to time unusual buying patterns or shifts in demand may cause large movements in the reserve balance 
warranty reserve the company s products generally carry express warranties that provide repairs at no cost to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product sold  but generally extends from one to ten years based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
certain components necessary to manufacture the company s vehicles including chassis  engines  and transmissions are covered under an original manufacturers warranty 
such manufacturers warranties are extended directly to end customers 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims at the time of sale based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales 
management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates 
infrequently  a material warranty issue can arise which is outside the norm of the company s historical experience  costs related to such issues  if any  are provided for when they become probable and estimable 
the company s warranty costs as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in  and in the decrease in the rate in is primarily due to decreased costs in the environmental solutions group 
management believes the reserve recorded at december  is appropriate 
a increase or decrease in the estimated warranty costs in would have decreased or increased operating income by million  respectively 
workers compensation and product liability reserves due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self funded for workers compensation and product liability claims with various retention and excess coverage thresholds 
after the claim is filed  an initial liability is estimated  if any is expected  to resolve the claim 
this liability is periodically updated as more claim facts become known 
the establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims  and management s estimate 
the company utilizes a third party claims administrator to pay claims  track and evaluate actual claims experience  and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
management believes that the reserve established at december  appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
the company has not established a reserve for potential losses resulting from the firefighter hearing loss litigation see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
if the company is not successful in its defense after exhausting all appellate options  it will record a charge for such claims  to the extent they exceed insurance recoveries  at the appropriate time 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to its net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or when an event 
table of contents occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october  goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using two valuation methods the income approach discounted cash flow analysis method  and the market approach guideline public company method 
under the income approach discounted cash flow analysis method the key assumptions consider projected sales  cost of sales  and operating expenses 
these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan  growth rates for revenues and operating expenses  and margin assumptions 
an additional key assumption under this approach is the discount rate  which is determined by looking at current risk free rates of capital  current market interest rates  and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment 
if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect  our fair value calculation may change  which could result in impairment 
the company s risk factors are discussed under item a of this form k 
under the market approach guideline public company method the company identified several publicly traded companies  including federal signal  which we believe have sufficiently relevant similarities 
for these companies the company calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda 
similar to the income approach discussed above  sales  cost of sales  operating expenses  and their respective growth rates are key assumptions utilized 
the market prices of federal signal and other guideline companies are additional key assumptions 
if these market prices increase  the estimated market value would increase 
if the market prices decrease  the estimated market value would decrease 
the results of these two methods are weighted based upon management s evaluation of the relevance of the two approaches 
in the current year evaluation management determined that the income approach provided a more relevant measure of each reporting unit s fair value and used it to determine reporting unit fair value 
management used the market approach to corroborate the results of the income approach 
management used the income approach to determine fair value of the reporting units because it considers anticipated future financial performance 
the market approach is based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for the business segment being evaluated 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed the annual assessment  determined that the goodwill associated with the fstech group reporting unit was impaired  and recorded impairment charges of million 
the impairment charge resulted from decreased sales and cash flow estimated in our fstech group 
as of december   the goodwill impairment charge is an estimate and may be adjusted during the first quarter of upon completion of a detailed second step impairment analysis 
we have not completed the second step because we are awaiting additional information needed to value certain assets of the reporting unit 
we will complete the second step in the first quarter of and changes to the estimated impairment we have recorded could be material 
the fair values of the other reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts by or more 
the company had no goodwill impairments in or adverse changes to the company s business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods which could be material 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information 
indefinite lived intangible assets an intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an 
table of contents indefinite useful life 
these assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when evaluating if an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life 
in addition  for indefinite lived intangible assets  significant judgment is applied in testing for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the annual assessment  the company concluded that the fair value determined by the income approach  of certain trade names in the fstech group was lower than the carrying value 
as a result  the company recognized a million impairment charge to trade names within the fstech segment in the fourth quarter of the company had no impairments in and adverse changes to the company s business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods  which could be material 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information 
postretirement benefits the company sponsors domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 
the following table summarizes the impact that a change in these assumptions would have on the company s operating income in millions assumption change basis point increase basis point decrease discount rate return on assets employee compensation levels the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is set by reference to published  high quality bond indices 
however  these indices give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices do not precisely match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan 
for this reason  we also consider the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure us pension liabilities decreased from in to in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation expense the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including the company s stock price  expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate  and expected dividend yield 
for expected volatility  we base the assumption on the historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the expected term of the awards is based on historical data regarding employees option exercise behaviors 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and expectation of dividend payouts 
in addition to the requirement for fair value estimates  asc topic also requires the recording of an expense that is net of an anticipated 
table of contents forfeiture rate 
therefore  only expenses associated with awards that are ultimately expected to vest are included in our financial statements 
our forfeiture rate is determined based on our historical option cancellation experience 
we evaluate the black scholes assumptions that we use to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
with respect to the forfeiture rate  we revise the rate if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expenses related to future stock based payments may differ significantly from estimates recorded in prior periods 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income  and other factors such as the taxing jurisdiction in which the asset is to be recovered 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent that  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have provided a valuation allowance at december  of million against our net domestic deferred tax assets based on our assessment of past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
specifically  beginning in the fourth quarter of we had three years of cumulative losses from continuing operations 
we believe having three years of cumulative losses from continuing operations limits our ability to look to future taxable income as a source for recovering our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and  as a result  we may increase or decrease our valuation allowance in future periods 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 
there were no similar charges recognized in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on de recognition and classification  and requires companies to elect and disclose their method of reporting interest and penalties on income taxes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
financial market risk management the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by targeting a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt generally within percentages between and 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix 
during the month of june  floating to fixed interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million matured and that portion of the company s debt was left floating rate 
since the floating rate of interest 
table of contents the company receives on its revolving credit facility has favorable pricing further enhanced by historically low libor rates  the company decided to maintain a percentage of floating rate debt outside of the to targets 
the following table presents the principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s total debt obligations held at december  in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a description of these agreements 
a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates in would have increased or decreased interest expense by million  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk although the majority of sales  expenses and cash flows are transacted in us dollars  the company has exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro and the british pound 
if average annual foreign exchange rates had collectively weakened against the us dollar by  pre tax earnings in would have decreased by million from foreign currency translation 
the company has foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates 
the company utilizes foreign currency options and forward contracts to manage these risks 
the following table summarizes the company s foreign currency derivative instruments as of december  all are expected to settle in in millions expected settlement date average notional contract fair amount rate value forward contracts buy u 
s dollars  sell euros buy british pounds  sell euros buy british pounds  sell euros other currencies total foreign currency derivatives see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a description of these agreements 
forward exchange contracts are recorded as a natural hedge when the hedged item is a recorded asset or liability that is revalued each accounting period  in accordance with asc topic  foreign currency matters 
for derivatives designated as natural hedges  changes in fair values are reported in the other income expense line of the consolidated statements of operations 
other matters the company has a business conduct policy applicable to all employees and regularly monitors compliance with that policy 
the company has determined that it had no significant related party transactions in each of the three years in the period ended december
