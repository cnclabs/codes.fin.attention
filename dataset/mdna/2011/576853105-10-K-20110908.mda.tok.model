item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition matrix service records profits on fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract cost 
matrix service records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
matrix service includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix service determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components 
matrix service has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
matrix service has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete fixed price contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts 
adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period on a percentage of completion basis when estimable and probable 
indirect costs  such as salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs and insurance costs  are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour 
warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred 
warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented 
overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred 
claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us 
recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
if all of the following requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim 
we must determine if there is a legal basis for the claim  the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 

table of contents as of june  and june   costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues for unapproved change orders of million and million  respectively 
there were no claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts as of june  or june  historically  our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized 
loss contingencies various legal actions  claims  and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or are otherwise disclosed  in accordance with asc  loss contingencies 
specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable 
we use a case by case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known 
we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
as of june  and june   insurance reserves totaling million and million  respectively  are included on our balance sheet 
these amounts represent our best estimate of our ultimate obligations for asserted claims  insurance premium obligations  and claims incurred but not yet reported at the balance sheet dates 
we establish reserves for claims using a combination of actuarially determined estimates and management judgment on a case by case basis and update our evaluations as further information becomes known 
judgments and assumptions  including the assumed losses for claims incurred but not reported  are inherent in our reserve accruals  as a result  changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future 
if actual results of claim settlements are different than the amounts estimated we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be significant 
a hypothetical ten percent unfavorable change in our claim reserves at june  would have reduced fiscal pretax income by million 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other period in which indicators of impairment warrant additional analysis 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including the discount rate  anticipated revenue growth rate and gross margins  estimated operating and interest expense  and capital expenditures are inherent in these fair value estimates  which are based on our operating and capital budgets as well as strategic plans 
as a result  actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
as a result of these uncertainties  we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of the scenarios in the discounted cash flow analysis 
although we do not anticipate a future impairment charge  certain events could occur that would adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events could include  but are not limited to  a change in economic or competitive conditions  a significant change in the project plans of our customers  the economic condition of the customers and industries 
table of contents we serve  and a material negative change in the relationships with one or more of our significant customers 
if our judgments and assumptions change as a result of the occurrence of any of these events or other events that we do not currently anticipate  our expectations as to future results and our estimate of the implied value of one or more of our reporting units also may change 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter to determine whether an impairment existed and to determine the amount of headroom at may  we define headroom as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value 
the amount of headroom varies by reporting unit 
approximately of our goodwill balance is attributable to one reporting unit 
this unit had headroom of at may  we have two additional reporting units with goodwill representing and of the total goodwill balance with headroom of and  respectively 
our significant assumptions  including revenue growth rates  gross margins  operating and interest expense and other factors  have been reasonably accurate in recent years  but may change in light of changes in the economic environment in which we operate 
assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged  a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom if the growth rate of estimated revenue decreases by one percentage point  the headroom of the reporting units referenced above would be reduced from  and to  and  respectively  if our estimate of gross margins decreases one percentage point  the headroom of the reporting units referenced above would be reduced from  and to  and  respectively  and if the applicable discount rate increases one percentage point the headroom of the reporting units referenced above would be reduced from  and to  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards there are no recently issued accounting standards that we believe will have a material affect on our financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  construction services and repair and maintenance services 
the majority of the work for both segments is performed in the united states  with of revenues generated in canada during fiscal as compared to in fiscal the primary services of our construction services segment are aboveground storage tanks for the bulk storage terminal industry  capital construction for the downstream petroleum industry  specialty construction  and electrical instrumentation services for various industries 
these services  including civil structural  mechanical  piping  electrical and instrumentation  millwrighting  and fabrication  are provided for projects of varying complexities  schedule durations  and budgets 
our project experience includes renovations  retrofits  modifications and expansions to existing facilities as well as construction of new facilities 
the primary services of our repair and maintenance services segment are aboveground storage tank repair and maintenance services  planned major and routine maintenance for the downstream petroleum industry  specialty repair and maintenance services and electrical and instrumentation repair and maintenance

table of contents the company s results were affected by the following items non routine charges the california pay practices class action lawsuits we recorded a pretax charge of million in fiscal related to this matter 
the charge was recorded as an increase to cost of revenues with million allocated to the construction services segment and million charged to the repair and maintenance services segment 
the charge is more fully in note contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
this charge is referred to as the charge on a legal matter throughout our discussion of financial results in this item claims receivable write down we recorded pretax charges totaling million in fiscal caused by a write down of the value of claim receivables acquired in the february acquisition of sm electric company  inc sme 
of the charge  million was the result of the recorded value of a claim exceeding the arbitration award 
the remaining million charge related to a separate claim receivable and was recorded in conjunction with our on going assessment of the recoverability of the recorded value of the claim receivables 
these charges are collectively referred to as the claims receivable write off in our discussion of financial results in this item and were recorded as an increase to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
this charge is more fully discussed in note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
claims receivable collection costs costs incurred to collect the claims acquired in the sme acquisition were higher than estimated and resulted in a pretax charge of million in fiscal and million in fiscal these charges are referred to as the claims receivable excess collection costs in our discussion of financial results in this item and were recorded as an increase to sg a expense 
these charges are more fully discussed in note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
significant loss on projects at june  estimated costs on a series of projects at a large complex in the gulf coast were well in excess of previous estimates resulting in a pretax charge of million in fiscal the increased costs were primarily due to difficult working conditions at the site and poorly defined scopes of work which led to inefficiencies  rework and cost overruns 
this charge was recorded as a reduction in gross profit in the construction services segment 
the charge is referred to as the loss on the projects at a gulf coast site throughout our discussion of financial results in this item fiscal versus fiscal consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million in fiscal the increase in consolidated revenues was a result of an increase of million in construction services revenues and an increase of million in repair and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million was largely due to the effect of higher revenues combined with an increase in gross margins from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross margin improvement was due to higher margins in both the construction services and repair and maintenance services segments where the gross margins increased to and in fiscal from and in fiscal  respectively 
consolidated sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the net decrease of million was primarily due to non routine charges incurred in fiscal including the claims receivable write off of million and higher claims receivable excess collection costs in fiscal  offset by higher legal and facility costs as well as higher incentive costs in fiscal resulting from better operating performance 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal net interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net interest expense in fiscal was due to an increase of amortization of debt issuance costs caused by amendment fees paid in fiscal other income in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  and related primarily to foreign currency transaction gains 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate due to state tax credits and a federal tax deduction for qualifying domestic construction activities 

table of contents construction services revenues for the construction services segment were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase was due to higher aboveground storage tank and electrical and instrumentation revenues  which increased to million and million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal  respectively 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by lower downstream petroleum revenues  which were million in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues of specialty revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to higher revenues  which increased million  combined with higher gross margins which increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal direct gross margins were negatively affected by a loss of million on the projects at a gulf coast site 
despite this charge  the direct gross margin was essentially unchanged between fiscal and fiscal as we were able to achieve higher direct margins on the balance of our work in fiscal the primary factor in our improved gross margin was the favorable effect of the improved recovery of overhead costs in fiscal caused by a higher business volume in fiscal and a non routine charge on a legal matter of million in fiscal repair and maintenance services revenues for the repair and maintenance services segment were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher electrical and instrumentation revenues which increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the electrical and instrumentation increase was primarily due to higher maintenance work from utilities in the northeastern united states 
downstream petroleum revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower aboveground storage tank revenues which decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to higher revenues  which increased million  combined with higher gross margins which increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the improvement in fiscal was primarily due to the favorable effect of the improved recovery of overhead costs caused by a higher business volume in fiscal and a non routine charge on a legal matter in fiscal  partially offset by lower direct margins in fiscal fiscal versus fiscal consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million in fiscal the decline in consolidated revenues was due to an overall decline in our level of business volume as our customers were cautious in their short term spending leading to short and long term delays in project awards  downsizing of projects  and delays and reductions in maintenance spending 
in addition  we did not experience the full effect of the recession in our core markets until the second half of fiscal therefore  the comparable prior year revenues were only partially impacted by the effects of the recession 
consolidated gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of million was due to lower business volume and lower gross margins which decreased to in fiscal compared to a year earlier 
the lower gross margins were primarily due to a charge on a legal matter of million and the loss of million on the projects at a gulf coast site 
gross margins in fiscal and were negatively affected by a lower volume of business available to recover overhead costs  particularly in fiscal consolidated sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the net decrease of million was the result of our on going efforts to reduce our cost structure due to an unfavorable business environment and was partially offset by the claims receivable write off of million and claims receivable excess collection costs of million 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to a lower level of revenues in fiscal net interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net interest expense in fiscal was due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash  higher unused revolving credit facility fees  higher rates on letters of credit issued under the credit facility and higher letter of credit balances 

table of contents other income in fiscal was million and related primarily to foreign currency transaction gains 
other income in fiscal was million and related primarily to insurance proceeds received 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate due to state tax credits and a federal tax deduction for qualifying domestic construction activities 
in fiscal  certain operating loss carryforwards previously reserved were utilized or deemed to be fully utilizable resulting in a benefit of million 
construction services revenues for the construction services segment were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to continued delays in project awards and a decline in our customers capital spending 
the lower spending led to declines in downstream petroleum  aboveground storage tank and specialty revenues which declined by million  million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these declines were higher electrical and instrumentation revenues  which increased to million in fiscal compared to million a year earlier 
the increase in electrical and instrumentation revenues was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of sme operations in fiscal compared to less than four months in fiscal due to the acquisition in february gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the reduction in revenues and lower gross margins which decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal fiscal margins were negatively affected by a lower volume of work which led to a lower recovery of overhead costs  the loss of million on the projects at a gulf coast site  and the charge on a legal matter of million 
repair and maintenance services revenues for the repair and maintenance services segment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline was due to a lower volume of recurring repair and maintenance work which has resulted in lower aboveground storage tank revenues  which decreased to million in fiscal compared to million a year earlier 
this decline was partially offset by higher downstream petroleum and electrical and instrumentation revenues  which increased to million and million in fiscal  compared to million and million a year earlier 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a reduction in revenues and lower gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margin reduction was due to lower direct margins  the unfavorable impact of unrecovered overhead costs caused by a lower volume of business and the charge on a legal matter of million 
one month ended june  compared to one month ended june  revenues declined million  or  from million in the prior period to million in the one month ended june  the decline was due to lower construction services revenues  which decreased million from million in the prior period to million in the one month ended june   and lower repair and maintenance services revenues  which decreased million from million in the prior period to million in the one month ended june  gross profit decreased million to million in the one month ended june  compared to million in the prior period 
the decline in gross profit was due to lower revenues  which decreased  and lower gross margins which decreased from in the prior period to in the one month ended june  the decline in gross margins was due to lower margins in the construction services segment which decreased from to and lower margins in the repair and maintenance services segment which decreased to compared to a year earlier 
gross margins in both segments were negatively affected by a lower volume of business available to recover overhead costs in the one month ended june  income before income taxes decreased million  from million in the prior period to million in the one month ended june  the decline was due to lower gross profit  which decreased million  partially offset by lower sg a expenses 

table of contents non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of income entitled net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information compared with net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions  which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  pay commitment fees to maintain our credit facility  and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the credit facility  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations 
it does not include depreciation or amortization expense 
because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations 
reconciliation of ebitda to net income in thousands twelve months ended one month ended june  june  may  june  net income interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda outlook we have seen improvement in both the construction services and repair and maintenance services segments in fiscal and we continue to experience a solid volume of bidding activity 
apart from the limited construction opportunities in portions of our downstream petroleum market  the overall outlook for our core markets is positive 
demand for our aboveground storage tank construction services remains high with a number of opportunities emerging in cushing  oklahoma and western canada 
our electrical and instrumentation business in the northeastern us remains a strong growth area for the company 
our refinery maintenance and turnaround business is stable  however  we expect to see an uptick in revenue throughout the next few quarters 
finally  our newly added engineering capabilities in the bulk materials handling sector should produce additional engineering and construction opportunities in the power generation and raw materials transportation markets as well as entry into the mining and minerals industries both domestically and internationally in the coming year 
financial condition and liquidity overview we define liquidity as the ability to pay our liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations 
our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal was cash on hand at the beginning of the year and cash generated from operations 
cash on hand at june  totaled million and availability under the senior revolving credit facility totaled million  resulting in total liquidity of million 

table of contents factors that routinely impact our short term liquidity and that may impact our long term liquidity include  but are not limited to changes in working capital contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers 
time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears 
therefore  we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected 
some of our large construction projects may require significant retentions or security in the form of letters of credit 
capital expenditures other factors that may impact both short and long term liquidity include acquisitions of new businesses strategic investments in new operations purchases of shares under our stock buyback program contract disputes or collection issues resulting from the failure of a significant customer maintaining full capacity under our senior revolving credit facility and remaining in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement in recent years  we funded the acquisition of certain businesses and technology with cash on hand 
however  in the future we may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common or preferred stock  convertible notes  term debt or increase the amount of our revolving credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of other businesses 
we will continue to evaluate our working capital requirements and other factors to maintain sufficient liquidity 
cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended june  totaled million 
major components of cash flows from operating activities are as follows cash flows provided by operating activities in thousands net income non cash expenses deferred income tax loss on disposition of property  plant and equipment cash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities other cash flows provided by operating activities the cash effect of significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include the following accounts receivable increased million 
the accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period based on many factors including  but not limited to  the volume of business and the rate of collections 
we consider the million increase in accounts receivable to be a normal fluctuation 
in addition  we consider both the aging and the amount of the june  accounts receivable balance to be normal based on historical trends 
accounts payable decreased by million 
the decrease was primarily due to a large steel purchase late in the prior fiscal year related to a significant aboveground storage tank project 
the net change in the combined balances of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings caused a decrease in operating assets and liabilities and an increase to cash of million 
this change was primarily attributable to higher advanced billings on aboveground storage tank contracts in the construction services segment 
other assets decreased by million due to the refunds of certain insurance deposits in fiscal 
table of contents income taxes receivable decreased by million due to the timing of income tax payments 
accrued expenses decreased by million 
the decrease is primarily the result of payments totaling million to settle the california pay practice class action lawsuits largely offset by higher accrued wages 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million of cash in the twelve months ended june  due to capital expenditures of million and the purchase of the assets of edc  inc totaling million  partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions of million 
capital expenditures included million for construction equipment  million for transportation equipment  million for office equipment and software and million for land and buildings 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used million of cash in the twelve months ended june  primarily due to capital lease payments of million and treasury stock purchases of million 
senior revolving credit facility the company has a five year  million senior revolving credit facility credit facility that expires on november  the credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the company s subsidiaries and is secured by a lien on substantially all of the company s assets 
the credit facility is primarily used to fund working capital and for the issuance of letters of credit 
at june   million of letters of credit were outstanding to support certain workers compensation programs and construction contracts 
availability at june  totaled million 
we believe the facility provides adequate liquidity and financial flexibility to support our current business 
however  we will assess the facility size and structure in conjunction with our upcoming renewal 
the credit agreement  as currently amended  includes the following limits share repurchases to million in any calendar year 
permits acquisitions so long as the company s senior leverage ratio on a pro forma basis as of the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the acquisition is below to and availability under the credit facility is at or above after consummation of the acquisition 
if the senior leverage ratio on a pro forma basis as of the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the acquisition is over to but below to  acquisitions will be limited to million in a twelve month period  provided there is at least million of availability under the credit facility after the consummation of the acquisition 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the additional margin on the libor based loans is between and based on the senior leverage ratio 
the additional margin on the alternate base rate loans is between and based on the senior leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate  federal funds effective rate plus or libor plus 
the unused revolving credit facility fee is between and based on the senior leverage ratio 
the credit agreement includes significant financial covenants and borrowing limitations that include the following tangible net worth must be an amount which is no less than the sum of million  plus the net proceeds of any issuance of equity that occurs after november   plus of all positive quarterly net income after november  senior leverage ratio must not exceed to  
table of contents asset coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to to  and  fixed charge coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to to consolidated funded indebtedness  as of the end of any fiscal quarter  cannot exceed times consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  over the previous four quarters 
the company is in compliance with all affirmative  negative  and financial covenants under the credit agreement and is at the lowest margin tier for the libor and alternate base rate loans and the lowest tier for the unused revolving credit facility fee 
dividend policy we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and the terms of our credit agreement limit the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
we currently intend to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business 
any future dividend payments will depend on our financial condition  capital requirements and earnings as well as other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 
treasury shares on february   our board of directors authorized a stock buyback program that allows the company to purchase up to  shares of common stock provided that such purchases do not exceed million in any calendar year commencing in calendar year and continuing through calendar year the company has not purchased any common shares under this plan 
matrix service may purchase shares in future periods if sufficient liquidity exists and the company believes that it is in the best interest of the stockholders 
in addition to any stock buyback program that may be in effect  the company may withhold shares of common stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligations upon vesting of an employee s deferred shares 
matrix service withheld  shares in fiscal to satisfy these obligations 
these shares were returned to the company s pool of treasury shares 
the company has  treasury shares as of june  and intends to utilize these treasury shares solely in connection with equity awards under the company s stock incentive plans 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of june   the following commitments and off balance sheet arrangements were in place to support our ordinary course obligations commitments by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands letters of credit surety bonds total all letters of credit issued under our credit facility are in support of our workers compensation insurance programs or certain construction contracts 
the letters of credit that support our workers compensation programs are expected to renew annually through the term of the credit facility  therefore  they are reported in the same period that the credit facility expires 
the letters of credit that support construction contracts will expire when the related work is completed and the warranty period has passed  therefore  these letters of credit are reported in the period that we expect the warranty period to end 
contractual obligations at june  are summarized below contractual obligations by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands operating leases acquisition payable capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents the acquisition of edc  inc included an asset purchase agreement that requires an additional payment as soon as practical after a measurement period if certain financial targets are achieved 
for additional information  see note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item we enter into purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our requirements for materials and supplies under contracts that we have been awarded 
the commitments  which are generally recoverable from our clients  are short term and are generally settled in less than one year 
we do not enter into long term purchase obligations on a speculative basis for fixed or minimum quantities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk results primarily from our variable rate indebtedness under our senior credit facility  which is influenced by movements in short term rates 
borrowings under our million revolving credit facility are based on an alternate base rate or libor as elected by the company plus an additional margin based on our senior leverage ratio 
although there were no amounts outstanding under the facility at june  and we did not borrow under the facility in fiscal  we have in the past and may in the future borrow against our revolving credit line to fund short term working capital needs 
financial instruments with interest rate risk at june  were as follows maturity by fiscal year fair value as of june  total in thousands long term debt variable rate debt there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility at june  nor were any amounts borrowed in fiscal at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds effective rate plus or libor plus 
the additional margin ranges from to on alternate base rate borrowings and from to on libor based borrowings 
the senior leverage ratio at june  placed the company in the lowest interest rate tier  resulting in libor and alternate base rate margins of and  respectively 
financial instruments with interest rate risk at june  were as follows maturity by fiscal year fair value as of june  total in thousands long term debt variable rate debt there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility at june  nor were any amounts borrowed in fiscal at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds effective rate plus or libor plus 
the additional margin ranges from to on alternate base rate borrowings and from to on libor based borrowings 
the senior leverage ratio for the year ended june  placed the company in the lowest interest rate tier  resulting in libor and alternate base rate margins of and  respectively 
foreign currency risk matrix service has subsidiaries with operations in canada with the canadian dollar as their functional currency
