expedition charter revenue was million in versus million in in  million related to our syndicated projects with clients of robert fraser partners llp rfp that included four separate projects enigma i and ii  firebrand and shantaram 
also in  million represented charter services sold to dorado ocean resources for deep ocean mineral mining exploration 
these two customers represented of our expedition charter revenue in other projects for included the et aircraft recovery and photomosaic project million and 
million from other charter services 
during the fourth quarter we initiated the first rfp project million for research  shipwreck search and survey services related to the enigma i project see operational projects  item 
artifact sales and other revenues primarily include coin sales  but also include other artifacts  merchandise  commissions  and other miscellaneous revenue 
artifact and other revenues for and were 
million and million  respectively 
we believe the decrease of million in artifact sales and other in primarily related to overall poor economic conditions and availability of new product offerings 
as of december   we had a remaining inventory of approximately  silver coins 
our artifact and other and exhibit revenue for and was predominantly us domestic based 
exhibit revenue was 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
odyssey s shipwreck pirates treasure is an interactive multi media exhibit and features hundreds of artifacts recovered from our deep ocean shipwreck expeditions 
the decrease of 
million in because odyssey s exhibit  shipwreck pirates treasure  was on tour for four months in versus eleven months on two separate tours in the non booked months in were related to downtime for planned exhibit refurbishment after runs at five venues and over  visitors 
the exhibit opened at the maryland science center in baltimore on october  and ran through january  in the exhibit was featured at two locations oklahoma city and charlotte  north carolina 
exhibit revenue varied dependent on the type of contract which was either a fixed rental or a per visitor basis 
the exhibit is currently booked through august 
table of contents cost and expenses cost of sales consists of shipwreck recovery costs  grading  conservation  packaging  and shipping costs associated with artifact and merchandise sales 
the primary cost component is from the sale of coins 
cost of sales for coins decreased for versus primarily because of fewer coins sold in actual cost as a percentage of coin sales was and in and  respectively 
there is no cost of sales component associated with the themed attraction and expedition charter revenues 
operations and research expenses primarily include all costs within archaeology  conservation  research  and marine operations  which include all vessel operations 
operations and research expenses were million in  compared to million in the million increase  or  was primarily related to our two chartered vessels million 
the dorado discovery vessel comprised million of the increase and has completed its charter with dorado ocean resources ltd 
in mid december after a successful four month charter in the south pacific see operational projects  item 
our second chartered vessel  which comprised million of the increase  was deployed during the second quarter to work on the shantaram project and then was sub chartered to a third party in the third quarter and went off charter in the fourth quarter 
the unfavorable charter variances were primarily offset by favorable variances for our two owned vessels  most of which represented the ocean alert which has been in port for the latter part of our current plans are either to sell or charter the ocean alert in marketing  general and administrative expenses primarily include all costs within the following departments executive  finance accounting  legal  information technology  human resources  marketing communications  sales and business development 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million in versus million in the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced corporate overhead of 
million including professional fees and expenses and depreciation 
receivable reserves of million in include approximately million which related to the sale of research for the shantaram project which has not been received 
if not collected  odyssey has the option to receive an additional percentage up to of the net proceeds assuming the target project is located 
the additional reserve of million represents the net amount due from dor for charter services 
the dor reserve does not include million of receivables which can be offset against our subscription payable to dor 
at the present time  we cannot determine with certainty as to the amount of cash we may or may not receive from our charter services with dor of which we have approximately a interest 
as discussed in part i  item business  operational projects and status  the dor expedition with odyssey achieved outstanding results in the first charter which covered approximately of dor tenements 
also  with the recent mining license issued to nautilus minerals  another mineral exploration company operating in the south pacific  there has been significant attention being given to this relatively new emerging industry 
dor is in the process of raising the additional capital in order to begin further operations in the initial areas of success 
odyssey has several possibilities for recognizing benefits from the accounts receivable from dor 
we may receive all or only a portion of the receivables in cash 
we have the option to convert our non mobilization portion of the accounts receivable into additional equity of dor at the last subscription price 
if we were to convert the receivables to equity  odyssey could increase its stake to approximately prior to any future dilution 
we can also convert all or a portion of the receivables into a note receivable or debenture which would provide a coupon rate and potentially other enhancements 
due to the lack of clarity on the ultimate form of collection of the dor receivable  we recorded a million receivable reserve against operations 
there remains a million account receivable from dor which could be offset against our subscription payable of million which is due by april  had we converted our accounts receivable into equity in dor  we would have also been required to absorb our ownership percentage of accumulated losses of dor 
since dor is in the start up phase of operations  continued losses would have eventually reduced our long term investment against the income statement as loss from unconsolidated entity 
we will retain our ownership interest in dor and continue to be very optimistic concerning the future potential of this emerging new business 
we believe that we may receive the economic benefit of all or a portion of the receivable that relates to the reserve that has been established and will continue to evaluate this asset accordingly in future periods 
other income or expense other income and expense generally consists of interest income on investments offset by interest expense on our revolving credit facility and other loans 
beginning in the fourth quarter  it also included the income or loss from our equity investment 
beginning in the fourth quarter it included the change in fair value of the derivatives related to our issuance of series g preferred stock and the gain loss on debt extinguishment 
total other expense was million in and 
million in the unfavorable difference of million primarily represented the change in fair value of the derivatives related to the series g redeemable preferred stock million and loss on our equity investment in dorado ocean resources million which has been recorded pursuant to accounting standards codifications 
see notes k and q of our consolidated financial statements for the discussion of the derivative loss and redeemable preferred stock and note j for our loss on our equity investment 
other items included the loss on debt extinguishment of 
million which resulted from our exchange of notes payable for an investment in the series g preferred stock see note q and 
million for interest expense on our revolving line of credit and other loans 

table of contents income taxes we did not record any provision benefit for income taxes in or due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets as of december  compared to million as of december  as required by the accounting for income taxes topic in the accounting standards codification asc  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery of high value shipwrecks such as hms sussex or successful admiralty proceedings regarding salvage claims to black swan high value cargo and thus a valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in our ability to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon our success in recovering and monetizing high value shipwrecks and our ability to generate expedition charter revenue 
our current estimates do not include monetizing any assets from the black swan or hms victory projects in we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period

see note q to the consolidated financial statements for further information and the planned accounting for this transaction 
other areas beginning in late  and so far in  odyssey has executed six agreements with clients of robert fraser partners llp rfp for four shipwreck search projects code named firebrand  shantaram and enigma i and ii  and two other follow up verification agreements on the projects 
these agreements total approximately million for which we have received approximately million

table of contents in february  odyssey closed on a project syndication deal with galt resources llc 
odyssey has received approximately million from galt which represent rights to future revenues of the project galt selects prior to december  if the project is successful  galt will recoup their investment plus three times the investment 
these amounts will be paid out of proceeds of the project 
galt will receive of the proceeds until this amount is recouped 
in addition they will share in the future net proceeds of the project at the rate of for every million invested 
the agreement allows galt to select only one project  and galt will be allowed to invest up to million total with the permission of odyssey 
during february  odyssey entered into a charter agreement with neptune minerals plc a uk company and neptune minerals  inc a nevada corp 
and neptune resources ltd 
a new zealand company for the dorado discovery to supply geological exploration services to neptune minerals to explore their tenements in the waters surrounding new zealand in the first half of odyssey expects to receive a minimum of million in cash for the charter services 
bank credit facility on april   we renewed our million revolving credit facility with fifth third bank the bank 
the renewed credit facility has a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate plus one hundred and fifty basis points  requires monthly payments of interest only  and is due in full april  the company will also be required to pay the bank an unused line fee equal to per annum of the unused portion of the credit line 
the line of credit is secured by approximately  numismatic coins recovered from the ss republic shipwreck  which amount will be reduced over the term by the amount of coins sold by the company 
the coins used as collateral are held by a custodian for the security of the bank 
the borrowing base is equal to forty percent of the eligible coin inventory valued on a rolling twelve month wholesale average value 
the company is required to comply with a number of customary covenants 
at december   the credit line was fully extended 
we are currently in negotiations with the bank to extend the line of credit 
trends and uncertainties our current business plan estimates positive cash flow from operation activities  which assumes several of our planned projects are financed through project syndications or other partnership opportunities 
one or more of these projected project financing or partnership opportunities may not be realized which may require the need for additional cash 
we are also estimating capital expenditure needs of approximately million primarily related to specialized equipment necessary for several of our upcoming projects 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our cash position will be sufficient to fund operating cash flows throughout the rest of taking into account our current cash flow expectations and expected revenues from multiple sources  including projected sales  syndicated projects and potential financing opportunities 
based upon current discussions with fifth third bank  we expect to renew or extend our existing credit facility before termination in april however  we cannot be assured of our ability to do so and may need to seek additional capital in to pay off our existing balance 
we have experienced several years of net losses resulting in a stockholders deficit 
our capacity to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon our success in recovering and monetizing high value shipwrecks  or to generate income from other projects 
while we have recovered more than tons of silver coins and hundreds of gold coins and other artifacts from the black swan project  we will not have the ability to immediately monetize any recovered cargo unless we are awarded title or a salvage award by the us district court or negotiate a settlement with other claimants in the case 
at the present time  we cannot determine how long that process may take 
we have also identified one of our potential high value target shipwrecks  hms victory  and at least one of our robert fraser shipwreck targets 
we may not be able to begin recovery operations on projects as planned or monetize any potential cargo in the short term 
if cash flow is not sufficient to meet our projected business plan requirements  we will be required to raise additional capital or curtail expenses 
while we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past  there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so
