item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations  estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with our principal producing properties located along the louisiana gulf coast in the west cote blanche bay  or wcbb  and hackberry fields  and in west texas in the permian basin 
in  we acquired an acreage position in western colorado in the niobrara formation 
we also hold a significant acreage position in the alberta oil sands in canada through our interest in grizzly oil sands ulc  and have interests in entities that operate in southeast asia  including the phu horm gas field in thailand 
we seek to achieve reserve growth and increase our cash flow through our annual drilling programs 
highlights oil and natural gas revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  production increased to approximately  barrels of oil equivalent  or boe  for the year ended december  from approximately  boe for the year ended december  during  we drilled gross net wells  which includes gross net wells drilled by our operators in the permian basin and bakken  and recompleted gross net wells 
of our new wells drilled  were completed as producing wells and one was waiting on completion 
during  we acquired approximately  additional net acres in the permian basin  which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to approximately  net acres 
effective as of april   we acquired leasehold interests in the niobrara formation in colorado and held leases for  net acres as of march  in may  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock and received approximately million in net proceeds  which we used to fund the acquisition of our interests in the niobrara formation  pay the purchase price for a portion of the additional acreage acquired by us in the permian basin in and for general corporate purposes 
on september   we entered into a new million senior secured revolving credit facility with the bank of nova scotia  as administrative agent  letter of credit issuer and lead arranger  and amegy bank national association  and repaid and terminated our existing revolving credit facility and term loan  each with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  with borrowings under our new revolving credit facility 
our borrowing base under this facility was increased from million to million in december recent developments in february  we entered into an agreement to acquire certain leasehold interests located in the utica shale in ohio 
the agreement also grants us an exclusive right of first refusal for a period of six months on 
table of contents certain additional tracts leased by the seller 
windsor  an affiliate of ours  has agreed to participate with us on a basis in the acquisition of all of the leases described above 
we will be the operator on this acreage in the utica shale 
the purchase price for our interest in the initial acreage is approximately million  subject to certain closing adjustments 
this transaction is expected to close in mid may critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates including those related to oil and natural gas properties  revenue recognition  income taxes and commitments and contingencies  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements oil and natural gas properties 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  all costs  including non productive costs and certain general and administrative costs directly associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  are capitalized 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of the oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the month unweighted average of the first day of the month price for the period and  and prior to  unescalated year end prices and costs  adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  if any  that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue  and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized  including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value  including related deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
such capitalized costs  including the estimated future development costs and site remediation costs of proved undeveloped properties are depleted by an equivalent units of production method  converting gas to barrels at the ratio of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposal of oil and natural gas properties  unless such dispositions significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proven oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas properties not subject to amortization consist of the cost of undeveloped leaseholds and totaled million at december  and million at december  these costs are reviewed quarterly by management for impairment  with the impairment provision included in the cost of oil and natural gas properties subject to amortization 
factors considered by management in its impairment assessment include our drilling results and those of other operators  the terms of oil and natural gas leases not held by production and available funds for exploration and development 
ceiling test 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of the oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the month unweighted average of the first day of the month price for the period january december of the applicable year beginning with  and prior to  unescalated year end prices and costs  adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  
table of contents if any  that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue  and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized  including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value  including related deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
ceiling test impairment can give us a significant loss for a particular period  however  future depletion expense would be reduced 
a decline in oil and gas prices may result in an impairment of oil and gas properties 
for instance  as a result of the drop in commodity prices on december  and subsequent reduction in our proved reserves  we recognized a ceiling test impairment of million for the year ended december  if prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids decline  we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and gas properties  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
no ceiling test impairment was required for the year ended december  asset retirement obligations 
we have obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and associated production facilities 
we account for abandonment and restoration liabilities under fasb asc which requires us to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
the asset retirement liability is recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability  which is generally when the asset is placed into service 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset 
upon settlement of the liability or the sale of the well  the liability is reversed 
these liability amounts may change because of changes in asset lives  estimated costs of abandonment or legal or statutory remediation requirements 
the fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of the plugging and abandonment or retirement  annual inflations of these costs  the productive life of the asset and our risk adjusted cost to settle such obligations discounted using our credit adjustment risk free interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our oil and natural gas assets  the costs to ultimately retire these assets may vary significantly from previous estimates 
oil and gas reserve quantities 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
netherland  sewell associates  inc  pinnacle energy services  llc and to a lesser extent our personnel have prepared reserve reports of our reserve estimates at december  on a well by well basis for our properties 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with sec guidelines 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 

table of contents our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income during the period the rate change is enacted 
deferred tax assets are recognized in the year in which realization becomes determinable 
periodically  management performs a forecast of its taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed  looking at both positive and negative factors 
a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established  if in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized 
at december   a valuation allowance of million had been provided for deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty of future taxable income 
revenue recognition 
we derive almost all of our revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas produced from our oil and gas properties 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment on substantially all of these sales from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers that month and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment received for all prior months are recorded at the end of the quarter after payment is received 
historically  our actual payments have not significantly deviated from our accruals 
commitments and contingencies 
liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we are involved in certain litigation for which the outcome is uncertain 
changes in the certainty and the ability to reasonably estimate a loss amount  if any  may result in the recognition and subsequent payment of legal liabilities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we seek to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in oil prices by utilizing energy swaps and collars  or fixed price contracts 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  as amended 
it requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
we estimate the fair value of all derivative instruments using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  correlation between index prices and our realized prices  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
designation is established at the inception of a derivative  but re designation is permitted 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and meeting the effectiveness guidelines of fasb asc  changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
we recognize any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness immediately in earnings 
to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations  for the period january through february  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials 
for the period march through december  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb 
table of contents production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials 
in november  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials  for the period january through december under the contracts  we delivered approximately of our estimated production 
under the contracts  we have committed to deliver approximately to of our estimated production 
such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
these forward sales contracts and fixed price swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc and related pronouncements 
results of operations results of operations the markets for oil and natural gas have historically been  and will continue to be  volatile 
prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of factors beyond our control

from to  our net equivalent oil production decreased from  barrels to  barrels due to our reduced drilling activity and normal production declines 
we currently estimate that our production will be between  and  boe 
however  such estimate may change based on a change in our expected drilling and recompletion activities or the changing economic climate and unforeseen events  such as hurricanes 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  we reported net income of  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of  for the year ended december  this increase in was due primarily to a increase in realized boe prices to from and an increase in net production to  boe  partially offset by an increase in lease operating expenses  a increase in general and administrative expenses and a increase in production taxes 
oil and gas revenues

accretion expense 
accretion expense increased slightly to  for from  for interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for from  for this increase was due to an increase in the interest rate paid as well as the recognition of approximately  in unamortized loan fees associated with the termination of the bank of america revolving credit facility 
effective september   this facility  along with the term loan with bank of america  were repaid with borrowings under our new senior secured revolving credit agreement with the bank of nova scotia  as administrative agent and letter of credit issuer and lead arranger  and amegy bank national association  entered into on september  this increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in average debt outstanding for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  total debt outstanding under our new revolving credit facility was million as of december   as compared to million outstanding under our prior facilities with bank of america as of the same date in total weighted debt outstanding under our facilities was million for and million for until september   amounts borrowed under our term loan and revolving credit facility with bank of america bore interest of and  respectively

income taxes 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million  in addition to numerous temporary differences  which gave rise to a deferred tax asset 
periodically  management performs a forecast of our taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed  looking at both positive and negative factors 
a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established if  in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized

in addition  the lease operating expenses for included  of unreimbursed expenses related to hurricane repairs as compared to approximately  of unreimbursed expenses related to hurricane repairs in production taxes 
production taxes decreased to  for from  for this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in oil and gas revenues mainly as a result of the decrease in the average realized boe price received 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased to  for  and consisted of  in depletion on oil and natural gas properties and  in depreciation of other property and equipment 
this compares to total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of  for this decrease was due primarily to the reduction in the book value of our oil and gas properties used to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this reduction resulted from the drop in commodity prices reflected as of december  and the resulting reduction in our proved reserves which caused us to recognize a ceiling test impairment to our full cost pool of  for the year ended december  impairment of oil and gas properties 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties and are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of our oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the month unweighted average of the first day of the month price for the period of january through december  and prior to  unescalated year end prices and costs  adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  if any  that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue  and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on our balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized  less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash write down is required 
there was no impairment charge for the year ended december  as a result of the drop in commodity prices on december   we recognized a ceiling test impairment of  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
net general and administrative expenses decreased to  for from  for this  decrease was due primarily to reductions in franchise taxes as a 
table of contents result of the impairment mentioned in the depreciation  depletion and amortization section above which reduced our net assets used to calculate franchise taxes  a reduction in stock based compensation expenses  reductions in payroll costs including payroll taxes and related benefits mainly due to decreases in the total number of employees partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative reimbursements from our affiliates and a decrease in general and administrative overhead related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool 
accretion expense 
accretion expense increased slightly to  for from  for interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  for from  for due to a decrease in average debt outstanding and lower interest rates on amounts borrowed under our facilities with bank of america

we had  of state income tax expense for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources overview 
historically  our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from our producing oil and natural gas properties  borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities and the issuance of equity securities 
our ability to access any of these sources of funds can be significantly impacted by decreases in oil and natural gas prices or our oil and gas production

credit facility 
in march  we entered into a three year secured credit agreement with bank of america  na providing for a revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement was subsequently amended and restated from time to time and  among other things  the maturity date was extended to april  borrowings under the revolving credit facility were subject to a borrowing base limitation  which was initially set at million  subject to adjustment 
effective july   the credit facility was increased to million and effective december   the amount available under the borrowing base limitation was increased to million 
on august   the lender completed its periodic redetermination of our borrowing base giving consideration to our year end and mid year reserve information and the lender s then current pricing decks  among other factors 
as a result of this redetermination  our available borrowing base was reset at million  primarily in response to significant declines in commodity prices 
our outstanding principal balance at the effective time of this redetermination was approximately million 
the approximately million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in excess of the new borrowing base was converted into a term loan as of august  an initial million payment was made on the term loan at that time and we agreed to make additional monthly payments of million commencing on september   with all unpaid amounts due on march  we paid the outstanding balance of the term loan in full in february on september   we repaid all borrowings under the credit facility 
outstanding borrowings under the term loan accrued interest at the eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement plus or  at our option  at the base rate which was the highest of the lender s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus half of  and the one month eurodollar rate plus plus 
effective august   we also agreed to an adjustment in the commitment fees  interest rates for revolving loans and fees for letters of credit under the credit facility 
specifically  we agreed to pay a commitment fees ranging from to an increase from to  b margin interest rates ranging from to for

in addition  we agreed to limitations on certain dispositions and investments and to mandatory prepayments of the loans from the net cash proceeds of specified asset sales and other events 
our obligations under the credit facility were collateralized by a lien on substantially all of our louisiana and west texas assets and were guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
the restated credit agreement contained certain affirmative and negative covenants  including  but not limited to the following financial covenants a the ratio of funded debt to ebitdax net income before deductions for taxes  excluding unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities and commodity hedges  plus depreciation  depletion  amortization and interest expense  plus exploration costs deducted in determining net income under full cost accounting for a twelve month period could not be greater than to  and b the ratio of ebitdax to interest expense for a twelve month period could not be less than to 
on july   we entered into a million term loan agreement with bank of america  na related to the purchase of new gas compressor units 
the loan began amortizing quarterly on march  on a straight line basis over seven years based on the outstanding principal balance at december  we made quarterly principal payments of approximately  amounts borrowed bore interest at bank of america prime

we were in compliance with all covenants at december  in connection with our scheduled spring borrowing base redetermination completed in march  scotia capital has advised us that it has approved an increase to our borrowing base from the current level of million to million 
in addition  scotia has given us a commitment letter providing for an amendment to our credit facility which would  among other things  increase the maximum commitment to million  provide for an million current borrowing base  extend the maturity date to april and reduce our average credit spread by basis points per annum from current levels 
both the increase in the borrowing base to million and the other proposed amendments to our existing credit facility will require the approval of our other current lender and the addition of one or more additional lenders to our bank group 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to amend our existing credit facility on the terms described above 
during  in conjunction with the repayment of the bank of america revolving credit facility on september   we expensed approximately  in unamortized loan fees associated with this facility  which is included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we used the proceeds of our borrowings under the credit facilities for the development of our oil and natural gas properties and other capital expenditures  acquisition opportunities and for other general corporate purposes 
building loans 
in june  we purchased the office building we occupy in oklahoma city  oklahoma  for million 
one loan associated with this building matured in march and bore interest at the rate of per annum  while the other loan matures in june and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
the remaining building loan requires monthly interest and principal payments of approximately  and is secured by the oklahoma city office building and associated land 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding on this loan 
capital expenditures 
our recent capital commitments have been primarily for the execution of our drilling programs  to fund grizzly s delineation drilling program and for acquisitions  primarily in the permian basin and the niobrara formation 
our strategy is to continue to increase cash flow generated from our operations by undertaking new drilling  workover  sidetrack and recompletion projects to exploit our existing properties  subject to economic and industry conditions  and explore acquisition and disposition opportunities 
we have upgraded our infrastructure and our existing facilities in southern louisiana with the goal of increasing operating efficiencies and volume capacities and lowering lease operating expenses 
these upgrades were also intended to better enable our facilities to withstand future hurricanes with less damage 
additionally  we completed the reprocessing of d seismic data in one of our principal properties  wcbb and shot d seismic for the first time 
table of contents in our hackberry field 
the new and reprocessed data enables our geophysicists to continue to generate new prospects and enhance existing prospects in the intermediate zones in the fields  thus creating a portfolio of new drilling opportunities 
in addition  with our acquisition of strategic assets in the permian basin in west texas  we are required to pay of all drilling costs for drilling activity on such properties 
to combat significant declines in the commodity prices during the second half of  management undertook a series of actions aimed at reducing capital spending and operating costs 
as a result  we reduced our drilling and other capital activities to a minimum in the fourth quarter of  releasing all rigs in southern louisiana and the permian and only selectively participating in wells in the bakken 
during  we were not bound by lease obligations and long term capital commitments relating to the exploration or development of our oil and gas properties 
as a result of the then current economic conditions  we initially reduced our estimated capital activities and aggressively sought price concessions from our service providers until such time costs were reduced to more appropriate levels 
in june  we restarted our drilling programs 
we commenced our drilling programs during march in our december  reserve reports  of our net reserves were categorized as proved undeveloped 
our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted  except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved developed reserves  or both 
to realize reserves and increase production  we must continue our exploratory drilling  undertake other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish those activities 
our inventory of prospects includes approximately proved undeveloped drilling locations at wcbb 
the drilling schedule used in our december  reserve report anticipates that all of those wells will be drilled by during  we recompleted wells and drilled wells  all of which were completed as producers  at wcbb for an aggregate cost of million 
from january  through march   we recompleted twelve existing wells and drilled two wells at our wcbb field 
we currently intend to spend a total of approximately to million to drill to wells and recomplete wells in our wcbb field during in our east hackberry field  in  we recompleted ten existing wells and drilled eight wells  all of which were completed as producers  for an aggregate cost of million 
from january  through march   we recompleted three existing wells and drilled three wells  two of which are currently drilling  at our east hackberry field 
we currently intend to drill seven to ten wells and recomplete five wells in our east hackberry field in total capital expenditures for our east hackberry field during are estimated at to million 
in the permian basin  our booked inventory of prospects includes gross net future development drilling locations 
during  gross net wells were drilled on this acreage  of which gross net were completed as producers and one gross net well was waiting on completion 
our aggregate capital expenditures in the permian basin were million in  which includes acreage acquisitions 
from january  through march   four gross two net wells were recompleted and five gross net wells were drilled on this acreage  three of which are waiting on completion and two of which are currently drilling 
we currently anticipate that our capital requirements to drill a total of to gross to net wells and recomplete ten gross five net wells in the permian basin in west texas will be approximately to million 
in the niobrara formation in western colorado  effective april   we acquired leasehold interests for a total of approximately million 
in addition  we recompleted one existing well and acquired additional acreage for an aggregate cost  including acquisition costs  of approximately million in we are in the process of permitting a square mile d seismic survey and expect to begin shooting in mid we currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures in the niobrara formation will be approximately million in relating to the seismic survey and drilling of four to five gross wells 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we purchased a interest in grizzly 
during  we paid grizzly million in cash calls 
as of december   our net investment in grizzly was approximately million 
in addition  we have loaned grizzly million including interest and net of foreign currency adjustments as of december  our capital requirements in for this project are currently estimated to be approximately million  primarily for the expenses associated with the initial preparations of the algar lake sagd facility and planned drilling activity 
capital expenditures in relating to our interest in thailand were approximately  capital expenditures in relating to our interest in thailand are expected to be approximately million  which we believe will be mostly funded from our share of production from the phu horm field 
our total capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be million to million  excluding our anticipated acquisition in the utica shale 
this is an increase from the million spent in due to improved commodity pricing and cost environment 
we intend to continue to monitor pricing and cost developments and make adjustments to our future capital expenditure programs as warranted 
we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal recurring operating needs and our wcbb  hackberry  permian basin  niobrara and grizzly capital requirements for the next twelve months 
although we currently anticipate significant free cash flow during  in the event we elect to further expand or accelerate our drilling programs  complete acquisitions including our anticipated acquisition in the utica shale or accelerate our canadian oil sands project  we may be required to obtain additional funds which we would seek to do through traditional borrowings  offerings of debt or equity securities or other means  including the sale of assets 
we regularly evaluate new acquisition opportunities 
needed capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we may be required to delay or curtail implementation of our business plan or not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us 
commodity price risk the volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  during the past five years  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per barrel  or bbl  in december to a high of per barrel in july the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per million british thermal units  or mmbtu  in september to a high of per mmbtu in january on march   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per barrel and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu 
any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves  and may result in write downs of oil and natural gas properties due to ceiling test limitations 
to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations  for the period january through february  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials 
for the period march through december  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials 
in november  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials  for the period january through december under the contracts  we delivered approximately of our production 
under the contacts  we have committed to deliver approximately to of our estimated production 
such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
these forward sales contracts and fixed price swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc and related pronouncements 

table of contents commitments in connection with the acquisition in of the remaining interest in the wcbb properties  we assumed the seller s chevron obligation to contribute approximately  per month through march  to a plugging and abandonment trust and the obligation to plug a minimum of wells per year for years commencing march  chevron retained a security interest in production from these properties until abandonment obligations to chevron have been fulfilled 
beginning in  we can access the trust for use in plugging and abandonment charges associated with the property 
as of december   the plugging and abandonment trust totaled approximately  at december   we have plugged wells at wcbb since we began our plugging program in  which management believes fulfills our current minimum plugging obligation 
contractual and commercial obligations the following table sets forth our contractual and commercial obligations at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years short term and long term debt asset retirement obligations total does not include estimated interest of  less than one year and  years and short term derivative instruments of  less than one year 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the sec published a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new rule permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to a report the independence and qualifications of its reserve preparer  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conducts a reserve audit  and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the new requirements are effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  early adoption is not permitted in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required 
we adopted this final rule as of december  the adoption of the rule resulted in a lower price used in reserve calculations and a decrease in reserves 
updated disclosures are included in item properties proved oil and natural gas reserves and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report

the amendments in this update also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under fasb asc to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments to fasb asc are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption did not have an immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues  operating results  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  the expected rates of declining current production  weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  technical advances affecting energy consumption  risks associated with operating drilling rigs  the availability of pipeline capacity  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  and the overall economic environment 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  during the past five years  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per barrel  or bbl  in december to a high of per barrel in july the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per million british thermal units  or mmbtu  in september to a high of per mmbtu in january on march   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per barrel and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu 
any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves  and may result in write downs of oil and natural gas properties due to ceiling test limitations 
for the period january through february  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials 
for the period march through december  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials

table of contents delivered approximately of our production 
under the contracts  we have committed to deliver approximately to of our estimated production 
such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
these forward sales contracts and fixed price swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc and related pronouncements 
at december   we had a net liability derivative position of million related to our fixed price swaps 
utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would have reduced the fair value of these instruments by approximately million  while a decrease in underlying commodity prices would have increased the fair value of these instruments by million 
however  any realized derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease of increase  respectively  in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 
our new revolving credit facility is structured under floating rate terms  as advances under this facility may be in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
as such  our interest expense is sensitive to fluctuations in the prime rates in the us or  if the eurodollar rates are elected  the eurodollar rates 
at december   amounts borrowed under our new revolving credit agreement bore interest at the eurodollar rate of 
based on the current debt structure  a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  per year  based on million outstanding under our credit facility as of december  as of december   we did not have any interest rate swaps to hedge our interest risks
