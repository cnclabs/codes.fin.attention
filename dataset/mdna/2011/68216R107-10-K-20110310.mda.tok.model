item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section is intended to help potential investors understand our financial performance through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at december  and  and our results of operations for the years ended december    and this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
omniamerican bancorp  inc did not exist at december   therefore  the information reflected in this section related to the years ended december  and reflects the financial performance of omniamerican bank 
overview our results of operations depend mainly on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by service charges and other fees  provision for loan losses  commissions  gains losses on sales of securities and loans  and other income 
our noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits  software and equipment maintenance  depreciation of furniture  software and equipment  fdic insurance  other operations  occupancy  and professional and outside services expenses 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions such as changes in energy prices which have an impact on the texas economy  as well as changes in interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations  or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in recent periods  increases in computer fraud affecting our operations and the operations of third party providers have increased our costs of doing business 
prior to our conversion to a federal savings bank in  we operated as a texas chartered credit union  concentrating our lending efforts on the origination of consumer loans  primarily the origination of indirect automobile loans 
since our conversion to a federal savings bank  we have changed the relative composition of our loan portfolio by emphasizing the origination of one to four family residential real estate loans  commercial business loans  commercial real estate loans  and real estate construction loans 
as a result  between december  and december   our consumer loans as a percentage of total loans decreased from to 
we have significantly increased our systems and administration to support the growth of our one to four family residential real estate  commercial real estate  and commercial business lending activities 
business strategy our primary objective is to remain an independent  community oriented financial institution serving customers in our primary market areas 
our board of directors has sought to accomplish this objective by adopting a business strategy designed to maintain profitability  a strong capital position  and high asset quality 
this business strategy includes the following elements diversifying our loan portfolio by emphasizing the origination of one to four family residential real estate loans  commercial real estate loans  and commercial business loans 
our strategy for increasing net income includes increasing our loan originations and diversifying our loan portfolio 
we intend to continue to emphasize the origination and purchase of one to four family residential real estate loans  as well as commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans  which increased to   and  respectively  of our total loans at december   from   and of our total loans at december  during 
table of contents  we also entered into a number of commercial business loan participations 
at december   our commercial business loan participations totaled million 
in the future  we intend to focus our commercial business lending on the origination of small to medium size business loans in our local market area 
by contrast  consumer loans decreased to of our total loans at december   compared to of our total loans at december  we anticipate the total dollar amount of our consumer loans to remain stable in the near term 
the increase in our one to four family residential real estate loans reflects the demand for these loans in our primary market areas 
the increases in commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans reflect our emphasis on this type of lending 
commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans generally are originated with higher interest rates compared to one to four family residential real estate loans and  therefore  have a positive effect on our interest rate spread and net interest income 
in addition  the majority of these loans are originated with adjustable interest rates  which assist us in managing interest rate risk 
continuing conservative underwriting guidelines and aggressive monitoring of our loan portfolio in order to maintain asset quality 
we introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place 
for example  a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of consumer loans which are generally considered to have higher risk than owner occupied one to four family residential loans 
for the years ended december  and  our average ratio of losses from consumer loans to average total loans was and  respectively 
our credit and collections department actively monitors the performance of our consumer and residential real estate loan portfolios 
when a loan becomes past due  we promptly contact the borrower by telephone or by written communication 
during each personal contact  the borrower is required to provide updated information and is counseled on the terms of the loan and the importance of making payments on or before the due date 
with respect to our commercial real estate and commercial business lending  collection efforts are carried out directly by our commercial loan officers 
commercial loan officers review past due accounts weekly and promptly contact delinquent borrowers 
past due notices are typically sent to commercial real estate customers and commercial business customers at days past due 
emphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the funding costs of our loan growth 
we offer interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts collectively referred to as core deposits  which generally are lower cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit  and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate 
for the years ended december      and  average core deposits represented     and  respectively  of average total deposits 
we intend to continue emphasizing our core deposits as a source of funding 
in this regard  we generally require that commercial banking borrowers open checking accounts with us at the time they establish a borrowing relationship with us 
managing interest rate risk 
as with most financial institutions  successfully managing interest rate risk is an integral part of our business strategy 
management and the board of directors evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  and determine the level of risk that is appropriate and consistent with our capital levels  liquidity  and performance objectives 
in particular  during the current low interest rate environment  we have sought to minimize the risk of originating long term fixed rate loans by selling such loans in the secondary market  and in particular selling to fannie mae all qualifying one to four family fixed rate residential real estate loans with terms in excess of years 
in addition  a significant percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial business loans and consumer loans which generally have shorter terms and provide higher yields than one to four family residential real estate loans 
we also monitor the mix of our deposits  a majority of which have been lower cost core deposits 
our strategy is to continue managing interest rate risk in response to changes in the local and national economy and to increase our assets as we deploy the proceeds from the offering 

table of contents implementing a controlled growth strategy 
we believe our infrastructure  personnel  and fixed operating base can support a substantially larger institution 
we intend to use our capital to grow organically and we may use a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering to pursue future acquisitions of commercial banks  savings institutions  financial services companies  and branch offices of such companies  including possible supervisory acquisitions 
the successful implementation of these strategies will allow us to offer our clients a broad range of financial services and products 
our goal is to have full relationship banking with our clients 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses are particularly susceptible to change in the near term  due to changes in credit quality which are evidenced by trends in charge offs and in the volume and severity of past due loans 
in addition  our loan mix is changing as we increase our commercial real estate and commercial business lending 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have greater credit risk than one to four family residential real estate and consumer loans due to these loans being larger in amount and non homogenous 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level to cover probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance for loan losses required  we record a provision for loan losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level 
the estimate of our credit losses is applied to two general categories of loans loans that we evaluate individually for impairment pursuant to asc  receivables  and groups of loans with similar risk characteristics that we evaluate collectively for impairment pursuant to asc  contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and reflects consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio 
the factors used to evaluate the collectability of the loan portfolio include  but are not limited to  current economic conditions  our historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  the financial strength of the borrower  and estimated value of any underlying collateral 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are subject to significant revision as more information becomes available 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
see also item business business of omniamerican bank allowance for loan losses 

table of contents impairment of investment securities 
the evaluation of the investment portfolio for other than temporary impairment is also a critical accounting policy 
in evaluating the investment portfolio for other than temporary impairment  management considers the issuer s credit rating  credit outlook  payment status and financial condition  the length of time the security has been in a loss position  the size of the loss position and other meaningful information 
if a decline in the fair value of an investment security below its cost is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
the amount of the credit related impairment write down is recognized in our earnings and the non credit related impairment for securities not expected to be sold is recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
a number of factors or combinations of factors could cause us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to these securities constitutes an impairment that is other than temporary 
these factors include failure to make scheduled principal and or interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions  and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
defined benefit retirement plan 
our costs and obligations related to our defined benefit pension plan are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed under asc topic  employers accounting for pensions 
management evaluates  reviews with the plan actuaries  and updates  as appropriate  the assumptions used in the determination of the pension obligation and expense and the fair value of pension assets  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets have a significant impact on the actuarially computed present value of future pension plan benefits that is recorded on the balance sheet as a liability and the corresponding pension expense 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 
to compute our pension expense for the year ended december   we used actuarial assumptions that included a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate of  used in this calculation  is the rate used in computing the benefit obligation as of december  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of is based on the weighted average expected long term returns for the target allocation of plan assets as of the measurement date  december   and was developed through analysis of historical market returns  current market conditions and the pension plan assets past experience 
although we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results

income taxes 
omniamerican bank became a taxable entity after converting from a credit union to a federally chartered savings bank on january  on that date  we established a net deferred tax asset of million as a result of timing differences for certain items  including depreciation of premises and equipment  unrealized gains and losses on investment securities  and bad debt deductions 
the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred tax asset is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment in their determination 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information  and we maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  and newly enacted statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance that could affect the relative merits of the tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results 
in addition  positions we take in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review of the positions we have taken by taxing authorities could result in a material adjustment to our financial statements 
on january   we adopted authoritative guidance under asc topic  income taxes 
this authoritative guidance prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with tax authorities for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

provision for loan losses 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  the increase in the provision is primarily due to a million  or  increase in loans classified as substandard  to million at december  from million at december   and a million  or  increase in net charge offs to million for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  at december   we identified impaired loans with balances totaling million

professional and outside services expense decreased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due primarily to  of previously capitalized initial public offering expenses relating to our terminated initial public offering in late which were charged to earnings during the year ended december  the decrease in other operations expense was due to higher expenses in the year ended december  due to  in costs related to the breach in our network security that occurred in early  net of a  reimbursement received from our insurance carrier  partially offset by  of costs in resulting from the heartland payment systems security breach 
heartland payment systems expenses consisted of fees imposed on us by visa to process merchant reimbursements for our customers  the cost of reissuing debit cards to our customers and the expense of the insurance deductible 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to a  increase in the texas state margin tax  to  for from  for our effective tax rate  including provisions for the texas state margin tax was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december

our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  advances from the federal home loan bank of dallas  and maturities and sales of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers  as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a liquidity ratio of or greater 
for the year ended december   our liquidity ratio averaged 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of december  
table of contents we regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of i expected loan demand  ii expected deposit flows  iii yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and iv the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are affected by our operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at december  on that date  we had million in federal home loan bank advances outstanding  with the ability to borrow an additional million 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million in commitments to extend credit 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in undisbursed lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totalled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales and federal home loan bank advances 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activity is originating loans 
we originated million  million  and million of loans during the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition  we purchased million  million  and million of securities during the years ended december    and  respectively 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we had a net decrease in total deposits of million for the year ended december  and a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended december   primarily due to the effects of the initial public offering 
we had a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended december  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of dallas  which provides an additional source of funds 
federal home loan bank advances decreased by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and increased million for the year ended december  federal home loan bank advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand and to purchase investment securities 
at december   we had the ability to borrow up to million from the federal home loan bank of dallas 
in addition  we maintained million in federal funds lines with other financial institutions at december  we also have a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of dallas which allows us to borrow on a collateralized basis at a fixed term with pledged assignments 
at december   the borrowing limit for this line of credit was million 

table of contents banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
for additional information  see note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment  and agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at december  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments

impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
us gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee  which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a net interest income simulation model which generates estimates of the change in our net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model assumes loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates  and deposit decay rates based on historical experience and current economic conditions 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i sell the long term  fixed rate one to four family residential real estate loans terms greater than years that we originate into the secondary mortgage market  ii lengthen the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer term wholesale funding sources such as fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank of dallas  iii invest in shorter to medium term securities  
table of contents iv originate commercial business and consumer loans  which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential real estate loans  and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  and v maintain adequate levels of capital 
we have not engaged in hedging through the use of derivatives 
net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the office of thrift supervision provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
historically  the office of thrift supervision model estimated the economic value of each type of asset  liability  and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that the united states treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by to basis points in basis point increments 
however  given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  an npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the office of thrift supervision provides us the results of the interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information we provide to the office of thrift supervision to estimate the sensitivity of our net portfolio value 

table of contents the table below sets forth  as of december   the office of thrift supervision s calculation of the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from the designated immediate changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
in addition to npv calculations  we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our internal net interest income model which is also summarized in the table below at december  at december  npv as a percentage of net interest income change in present value of assets increase decrease in interest rates estimated increase increase estimated estimated net interest basis points estimated decrease in npv decrease net interest income npv amount percent npv ratio basis points income amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
the office of thrift supervision model illustrates the change in the economic value of our assets and liabilities at december  assuming an immediate change in interest rates 
the table above indicates that at december   under the office of thrift supervision model  in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience an decrease in net portfolio value 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a increase in net portfolio value 

table of contents net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for a rolling forward twelve month period using historical data for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  the current term structure for interest rates  and current deposit and loan offering rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase or a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as of december   using our internal interest rate risk model  we estimated that our net interest income for the year ended december  would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates  and would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point decrease in market interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income 
modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
