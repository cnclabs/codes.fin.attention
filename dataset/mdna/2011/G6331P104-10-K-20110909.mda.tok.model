table of contents year ended june  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data total assets total liabilities redeemable convertible preferred shares total shareholders equity effective on july   we adopted asc topic formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment using the prospective transition method to account for options granted to employees using the straight line method of attribution for share based compensation 
on july   we concluded that the graded vesting method of attribution  which is an allowable alternative under us gaap  was a preferable accounting principle 
accordingly  we changed from the straight line method to the graded vesting method of attribution and applied the change in accounting principle retrospectively to reflect the cumulative and period effects of applying the new accounting policy 
beginning on july   we changed our revenue recognition method from sell through to sell in as we determined that we were able to make reliable estimates of stock rotation returns and price adjustments 
this change in estimate resulted in an increase of million in revenue  net of estimated price adjustments and stock rotation rights  and an increase of million in net income for fiscal year we held a equity interest in apm at june  we made an additional equity investment of million in apm in october and held a equity interest in apm immediately prior to the apm acquisition  and the investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of apm and apm operating results were reflected in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition 
upon the completion of the apm acquisition in fiscal year  we performed a review and assessment of the useful lives of our certain property and equipment 
based on the results of our review  we revised the estimated useful life of our manufacturing machinery and equipment for depreciation purposes from years to years beginning december  on a prospective basis 
the effect of this accounting change was to decrease depreciation expense related to cost of goods sold by million  increase net income by approximately million  net of a tax effect of million  and increase basic net income per share by approximately and increase diluted net income per share by approximately for fiscal year conversion from ifrs to us gaap we formerly prepared our consolidated financial statements under ifrs and filed our ifrs financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  in our annual report on form f 
pursuant to sec requirements  we assessed our ownership structure as of december  and determined that we no longer qualified as a foreign private issuer under applicable sec rules 
as a result  beginning july   we are required to report our consolidated financial statements under us gaap and file our annual report on form k  as well as to comply with additional sec reporting obligations as a domestic issuer 
accordingly  we have converted our consolidated financial statements under ifrs to us gaap 
a summary of significant relevant differences of individual items in the financial statements between ifrs and us gaap and their impact to our historical consolidated financial data above is outlined below redeemable convertible preferred shares in connection with changes made to the terms of our bye laws in december  our preferred shares were amended to include certain rights and features such as deemed liquidation and variable conversion to common shares 
accordingly  these redeemable convertible preferred shares were classified and presented as mezzanine equity under us gaap for the fiscal year ended june  following changes to our bye laws in october to reverse these amended terms  all preferred shares were reclassified to equity under us gaap 
under ifrs  such preferred shares were classified as a liability for the fiscal year ended june  this 
table of contents reclassification required that the preferred shares be marked to market at each reporting period 
as a result  our ifrs financial statements as reported in our previous annual report in form f included a non cash  non operating charge of million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
following further changes to our bye laws in october  all preferred shares were reclassified to equity under ifrs and no further charges were incurred 
all our preferred shares were converted to common shares concurrent with the close of our ipo in may inventory reserves we record inventories at the lower of cost or market under both us gaap and ifrs 
under us gaap  a write down of inventory to the lower of cost or market creates a new cost basis that subsequently cannot be reversed based on changes in circumstances 
under ifrs  when circumstances that previously caused the inventory write down no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realizable value  the amount of the write down is reversed even though the associated inventories have not been sold 
the impact to the statement of income loss due to the difference between us gaap and ifrs related to inventory reserves for the fiscal years ended june    and was    and nil  respectively 
share based compensation expense under us gaap  prior to july   we accounted for options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic value method  deferred compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant if the fair value of the underlying share exceeds the exercise price  and expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grant  generally five years 
effective on july   we adopted asc topic formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment using the prospective transition method to account for options granted to employees 
under the prospective method  new awards or awards modified  repurchased  or canceled after the effective date are accounted for under the provision of asc topic  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values of the awards 
we amortize the fair value of options or equity awards using the graded vesting attribution method over the respective vesting period which is generally over five years 
under ifrs  we accounted for share based compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards effective on january  the fair value of options or equity awards is amortized using the graded vesting attribution method over the respective vesting period which is generally over five years 
the difference in share based compensation expense related to accounting for the different transition dates between us gaap and ifrs and the application of apb for the fiscal years ended june    and was    and  respectively 
investment in apm we have made various investments in apm since apm inception in july prior to our acquisition of apm in december  the investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting under both ifrs and us gaap 
the difference between us gaap and ifrs for the fiscal years ended june    and was    and  respectively 

table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
overview we are a designer  developer and global supplier of a broad range of power semiconductors 
we have a broad portfolio of power semiconductors that we actively market and we seek to continuously add to our product portfolio each year 
our portfolio of power semiconductors is extensive  with over products  and has grown rapidly with the introduction of over new products each year during the past three fiscal years 
in addition  our patent portfolio has grown to include patents and patents applications in the united states at the end of fiscal year we seek to differentiate ourselves by integrating our expertise in device physics  process technology  design and advanced packaging to optimize product performance and cost 
our portfolio of products targets high volume applications  including portable computers  flat panel tvs  smart phones  battery packs  portable media players  motor control and power supplies 
during the fiscal year ended june   we launched several key product families and technologies to enable high efficiency power conversion solutions 
we broadened our mosfet product family by expanding our high voltage product line with the introduction of the alphamos tm and alphaigbt tm technology platform that lower on resistance to enable high efficiency ac dc conversion 
the development in high voltage product line enables us to broaden the markets we serve 
we also released our third generation ezbuck dc dc power ic family which offers higher efficiency and output current to power the latest chipsets used in a wide range of consumer applications 
our new pairfet advanced packaging technology allows high power density dc dc conversion in computing and communication applications by integrating two mosfets in a single package  with the performance of two independent mosfets 
we have assembled a team of scientists and engineers globally and have developed an extensive portfolio of intellectual property 
our intellectual property portfolio and technical knowledge encompass major aspects of power semiconductors  providing us with a platform to rapidly introduce innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced electronics 
our transnational business model leverages global resources  including leading research and development expertise in the united states  cost effective semiconductor manufacturing in asia and localized sales and technical support in several fast growing electronics hubs globally 
our core research and development team  based in silicon valley  is complemented by our design center in taiwan and process  packaging and testing engineers in china 
while we currently utilize third party foundries for our wafer fabrication  we are in the process of transition from a fabless to a fab lite business model 
under this model  we intend to allocate our wafer manufacturing requirements to both in house and outsourced capacities  which we believe would allow us to accelerate technology development  bring products to market faster  reduce manufacturing costs and improve our long term financial performance 
as part of this transition  we recently announced our intention to acquire certain assets associated with a mm wafer fabrication facility located in hillsboro  oregon from idt 
we also deploy and implement our proprietary power discrete processes and equipment at third party foundries to maximize the performance and quality of our products 
in addition  in december  we acquired control of apm 
after the acquisition  apm became our wholly owned subsidiary and we primarily rely upon our two in house facilities for packaging and testing 
we believe our in house packaging and testing capability provides us with a competitive advantage in proprietary packaging technology  product quality  cost  flexibility and cycle time 
on december   we acquired control of apm in a cash and stock transaction with a purchase price of million 
we had a equity interest in apm prior to the acquisition and the equity investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
after the acquisition  apm became our wholly owned subsidiary 
we formerly prepared our consolidated financial statements under ifrs and filed our ifrs financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  in our annual report on form f 
pursuant to the sec requirements  we assessed our ownership structure as of december  and determined that we no longer qualified as a foreign private issuer 
as a result  beginning on july   we are required to report our financial statements under us gaap and file our annual report on form k  as well as to comply with additional sec reporting obligations as a domestic issuer 
accordingly  we have converted our consolidated financial statements from ifrs to us gaap 
see item selected consolidated financial data for a discussion of relevant differences of individual items in the financial statements between ifrs and us gaap 
our revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   represented an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  our net income was million  or per diluted 
table of contents share  for fiscal year  compared to a net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year factors affecting our performance our performance is affected by several key factors  including the following global economic conditions because our products primarily serve consumer applications  a deterioration of the global and regional economic conditions could materially affect our revenue and results of operations 
in june  we began to experience a general slow down of global economic conditions  particularly in our core computing and consumer markets  that have adversely affected our results of operations 
we cannot be certain as to how long this trend will continue and how much negative impact it will have on our results of operations 
distributor ordering patterns and seasonality our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their forecasts of end customer demand  and this demand may vary significantly depending on the sales outlooks and market and economic conditions of end customers 
because these forecasts may not be accurate  channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly  which in turn may prompt distributors to make significant adjustments to their purchase orders placed with us 
as a result  our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
in addition  because our products are used in consumer electronics products  our revenue is subject to seasonality 
our sales seasonality is affected by a number of factors  including global and regional economic conditions  revenue generated from new products  changes in distributor ordering patterns in response to channel inventory adjustments and end customer demand for our products and fluctuations in consumer purchase patterns prior to major holiday seasons 
however  in recent period broad fluctuations in the semiconductor markets and the global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality 
product introductions and customers specification our success depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis that meet our customers specifications 
both factors  timeliness of product introductions and conformance to customers requirements  are equally important in securing design wins with our customers 
our failure to introduce products on a timely basis that meet customers specifications could adversely affect our financial performance 
erosion of average selling price erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical in our industry 
consistent with this historical trend  we expect that average selling prices of our established products will continue to decline in the future 
however  as a normal course of business  we seek to offset the effect of declining average selling prices by reducing manufacturing cost of existing products and introducing new and higher value products 
manufacturing costs our gross margin may be affected by our manufacturing costs  including pricing of wafers and semiconductor raw materials  which may fluctuate from time to time largely due to the market demand and supply 
capacity utilization may also affect our gross margin because we have certain fixed costs associated with our in house packaging and testing facilities 
if we are unable to utilize the capacity of our in house manufacturing facilities at a desirable level  our gross margin may be adversely affected 
during fiscal year  we acquired apm and continued to expand our in house packaging and testing capacity 
as part of our transition to a fab lite business model  on august   we announced our intention to acquire certain assets associated with a wafer fabrication facility from idt  which is expected to close prior to january  we expect the idt acquisition to accelerate our technology and product development and reduce our manufacturing costs  thereby improving our long term financial performance 
however  we currently anticipate an initial ramp up period of two to three quarters following the proposed acquisition  and during this period  we do not expect to observe any significant improvement in our gross margin as a result of this acquisition 
following the initial ramp period  we expect the fab lite approach would have a positive impact on our gross margin by allowing us to develop high value products more quickly and in a more cost effective manner 
other factors that may affect comparability apm acquisition we held a equity interest in apm at june  we made an additional equity investment of million in apm in october resulting in a equity interest in apm 
the investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting through the date of acquisition 
on december   we acquired apm and apm operating results were reflected in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to that date 
change in accounting estimate during fiscal year  upon the completion of apm acquisition  we performed a review and assessment of the useful lives of certain of our property and equipment 
based on the results of our review  we revised the estimated useful life of our manufacturing and facility equipment for depreciation purposes from years to years beginning december  on a prospective basis 
the effect of this change was to decrease depreciation expense by 
table of contents million  increase net income by approximately million  net of a tax effect of million  and increase basic net income per share by approximately and increase diluted net income per share approximately by for fiscal year public company expenses our general and administrative expenses have increased since our ipo effective in april due to the additional legal  accounting and consulting fees as well as additional headcount that we added in order to comply with additional requirements as a public company  including costs associated with establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and preparing and filing periodic reports required under federal securities laws 
we also established the employee share purchase plan the espp effective upon the completion of the ipo  and accordingly we incurred share based compensation expenses associated with such purchase rights 
in addition  our recent transition from a foreign private issuer to a domestic issuer status under the federal securities laws also requires us to incur additional legal and accounting expenses in order to comply with incremental sec reporting obligations for a domestic issuer 
principal line items of statements of income loss the following describes the principal line items set forth in our consolidated statements of income loss revenue we generate revenue from the sale of our power semiconductors  consisting of power discretes and power ics 
historically  a majority of our revenue was derived from power discrete products and a small but growing amount was derived from power ic products 
because our products typically have three to five years life cycles  the rate of new product introductions is an important driver of revenue growth over time 
we believe that expanding the breadth of our product portfolio is important to our business prospects  because it provides us with an opportunity to increase our total bill of materials within an electronic system and to address the power requirements of additional electronic systems 
on december   we acquired apm and our revenue included apm revenue generated by providing packaging and testing services to third parties since the apm acquisition 
our product revenue includes the effect of the estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that we expect to provide to our distributors 
stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of products purchased by the distributor during a specified period 
at our discretion or upon our direct negotiations with odms or oems  we may elect to grant special pricing that is below the prices at which we sold our products to the distributors  in these situations  we will grant price adjustments to the distributors reflecting such special pricing 
we estimate the price adjustments for inventory at the distributors based on factors such as distributor inventory levels  pre approved future distributor selling prices  distributor margins and demand for our products 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs associated with semiconductor wafers  packaging and testing  personnel  including share based compensation expense  overhead attributable to manufacturing  operations and procurement  yield improvements  capacity utilization  warranty and inventory reserves 
as the volume of sales increases  we expect cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollar amount 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect that our total operating expenses will generally increase in absolute dollar amount over time due to our belief that our business will continue to grow 
however  our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits  share based compensation expense  expenses associated with new product prototypes  travel expenses  fees for engineering services provided by outside contractors and consultants  amortization of software and design tools  depreciation of equipment and overhead costs for research and development personnel 
as we continue to invest significant resources in developing new technologies and products  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar amount 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits  share based compensation expense  product promotion costs  occupancy costs  travel expenses  expenses related to sales and marketing activities  amortization of software  depreciation of equipment  maintenance costs and other expenses for general and administrative functions as well as costs for outside professional services  including legal  audit and accounting services 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar amount as we 
table of contents expand our business 
income loss on equity investment in apm we had a equity interest in apm at june  and a equity interest in apm prior to the apm acquisition on december  our investment in apm was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded income loss on equity investment in apm in our statements of income loss 
income tax expense benefit we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions 
significant judgment and estimates are required in determining our worldwide income tax expense 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations of different jurisdictions globally 
we establish accruals for potential liabilities and contingencies based on a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  the applicable accounting guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
if the actual tax outcome of such exposures is different from the amounts that were initially recorded  the differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made 
changes in the location of taxable income loss could result in significant changes in our income tax expense 
we record deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize them  based on historical profitability and our estimate of future taxable income in a particular jurisdiction 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  tax planning strategies or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the deferred tax assets may increase or decrease  resulting in corresponding changes in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide profits or losses  the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region where we have operations  the availability of tax credits and carry forwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

table of contents operating results comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year the following tables set forth selected statements of income loss data derived from our audited consolidated financial statements  also expressed as a percentage of revenue  for the fiscal years ended june   and our historical results of operation are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

table of contents our revenue was million for fiscal year  increased by million  or  from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily as a result of a increase in unit shipments  a increase in average selling prices due to favorable product mix and a million increase in packaging and testing services revenue generated by apm since we acquired apm in december toward the end of fourth quarter in fiscal year  we began to experience a general slow down on a global basis in our core computing and consumer markets and softened demand causing a shift in product mix and average selling prices 
we introduced and new products during fiscal years and  respectively 
new products introduced in fiscal years included high voltage and medium voltage products that were developed based on our new technology platforms 
revenue from these high voltage and medium voltage products were ramped up slowly as we gradually gained design wins in the new application markets 
as we continued to expand our power ic product family  revenue from our power ic products for fiscal year increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal year our revenue was million for fiscal year  increased by million  or  from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily as a result of a increase in unit shipments due to increased end customer demand for our products  offset by a decline in average selling prices

our gross margin improved by to for fiscal year from for fiscal year this improvement was primarily due to higher factory utilization as the majority of our packaging and testing manufacturing was handled in house after we acquired apm and a decrease in packaging and testing service fees paid to third party contractors 
we also changed our estimated depreciation life for our manufacturing machinery and equipment from years to years  which resulted in lower depreciation expense in fiscal year these cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in wafer prices from our primary foundry 
we expect that our gross margin will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of variations in our product mix  semiconductor wafer and raw material pricing  manufacturing labor cost and factory utilization 
cost of goods sold was million for fiscal year  increased by million  or  from million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased unit shipments 
our gross margin improved by to for fiscal year from for fiscal year this improvement was primarily due to lower material costs associated with our volume purchases and lower packaging and testing costs  including savings from increased utilization of our in house packaging and testing facility during fiscal year research and development expenses year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage research and development research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  increased by million  or from million for fiscal year this increase was partially attributable to a million increase in engineering and new products prototyping expenses as we introduced new products during fiscal year  compared to new products in fiscal year in addition  we incurred million incremental expenses in qualifying a new third party fabrication facility 
table of contents to expand our manufacturing capacity 
the increase in research and development expenses was also attributable to a million increase in personnel expenses as we increased headcount and bonuses in fiscal year  a million increase in share based compensation expense  and a million increase in facility expenses as our corporate and research and development center in the us was relocated to a larger facility in march as we continue to invest significant resources in developing new technologies and new products and expanding our manufacturing capacity  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar amount 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  increased by million  or from million for fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel expenses as we increased headcount and bonuses  while in fiscal year  we implemented temporary salary reductions and holiday office closures in response to the global economic recession  which resulted in lower salary  bonus and vacation expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in engineering and new products prototyping expenses due to the timing of product prototyping and savings from increased research and development activities performed at our in house packaging and testing facility  while we continued to invest in our new products development and introduced new products in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  increased by million  or  from million for fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel expenses due to an increase in headcount and bonuses  a million increase in sales commissions and sales samples associated with our revenue growth  and a million increase in share based compensation expense 
in addition  we incurred million of professional fees related to the conversion of our financial statements under ifrs to us gaap and a million incremental expenses associated with the requirements of being a public company 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was also attributable to a million increase in facility expenses as our corporate and research and development center in the us was relocated to a larger facility in march and a million of incremental professional services fees related to the apm acquisition in december these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in audit  tax and legal expenses that were incurred in connection with our ipo in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  increased by million  or  from million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a million increase in personnel expenses as we increased our headcount and bonuses in fiscal year we implemented temporary salary reductions and holiday office closures in fiscal year in response to the global economic recession  and these cost reduction measures resulted in lower salary  bonus and vacation expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was also attributed to a million increase in our sales commissions  product promotion and travel related expenses as we generated more revenue with increased sales and marketing activities during fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was also attributed to a million increase in expenses related to our audit and ipo activities during fiscal year in addition  we became a public company in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and incurred an additional million in expenses associated with the requirements of being a public company 
these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in legal costs related to a patent litigation which was settled in fiscal year 
table of contents income loss on equity investment in apm year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage income loss on equity investment in apm income loss on equity investment in apm was million for fiscal year  decreased by million  or  from million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to consolidation of apm financial results into our financial statements since the apm acquisition in december and a million benefit related to our share of deferred tax assets apm recognized during fiscal year income loss on equity investment in apm was million and loss of  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase was due to higher profitability generated by apm resulting from higher packaging and testing processing volume during fiscal year  as well as a million tax benefit recognized related to apm deferred tax assets during fiscal year income tax expense benefit year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage income tax expense benefit our income tax expense for the fiscal years ended june  and was million and million  respectively 
income tax expense increased by million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to an increased percentage of our pretax book income in fiscal year being subject to the taxes in higher tax rate jurisdictions  largely as a result of our acquisition of apm in december  partially offset by million of increased us federal research and development credits as a result of the extension of the us federal research and development credit retroactive to december  during fiscal year our income tax expense was million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended june  this was due primarily to the increased profitability in fiscal year in certain foreign jurisdictions  partially offset by million less us federal research and development credits in fiscal year as compared to and a million valuation allowance release in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our principal need for liquidity and capital resources is to maintain working capital sufficient to support our operations and to make capital expenditures to finance the growth of our business 
to date  we have primarily financed our operations through funds generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving lines of credit  proceeds from our ipo  and the issuance of preferred shares 
our ipo became effective on april  and closed on may  approximately million common shares were sold in our ipo at the price of per share  including million shares newly issued by us and approximately million shares sold by our selling shareholders 
gross proceeds received by us from the million shares were million  and net proceeds were million after deducting million for underwriting discounts and commissions and million for other offering related costs 
since the completion of the ipo to june   we have invested all of net proceeds of million received by us from our ipo in our in house packaging and testing facilities  including million paid for the acquisition of apm 
we believe our in house packaging and testing capability provides us with improved gross margin  faster time to market for our new products  and competitive advantages in proprietary packaging technology and product quality 

table of contents in april  one of our subsidiaries in china entered into a revolving line of credit arrangement with a chinese bank to allow us to draw down  from time to time  up to of the balance of the subsidiary accounts receivable with a maximum amount of million chinese rmb equivalent of million as of june  to finance the subsidiary accounts receivable on a maximum of day repayment term 
the interest rate on each drawdown varies and indexes to the published london interbank offered rate per annum 
there was no outstanding balance at june  the effective interest rate for the borrowing was for the fiscal year ended june  in december  we acquired apm and assumed apm bank borrowing liabilities 
these bank borrowings were made under various line of credit agreements with local banks 
the interest rate on each drawdown from these lines of credit varies and indexes to the published london interbank offered rate per annum 
the effective interest rate for these borrowings was for the fiscal year ended june  apm property and equipment with carrying amount of million were pledged as collateral under one of the lines of credit 
there was no outstanding balance at june  these lines of credit have expired as of the filing of this annual report 
the following outlines the details of each line of credit and its available credit amount as of june  line of credit maturity date maximum limit in chinese rmb maximum limit us dollar equivalent available credit at june  in thousands a july  b august  c july  d july  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including working capital and capital expenditures  for at least the next twelve months 
in the long term  we may require additional capital due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if our cash is insufficient to meet our needs  we may seek to raise capital through equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and may include operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
cash and cash equivalents as of june  and  we had million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and short term bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less

this amount was increased by depreciation and amortization expense of million  share based compensation expense of million and an increase of million in accrued liabilities 
net cash 
table of contents generated from operating activities was partially offset by a total of million in income on equity investment in apm and gain on equity interest in apm  an increase in inventories of million due to an increase in raw materials and wafers since the majority of our packaging and testing manufacturing process was handled in house  and by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the timing of our shipments and collections 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  was million  which consisted primarily of our net income of million  increased by depreciation and amortization expense of million  share based compensation expense of million and an increase of million in accrued liabilities 
these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by million in income on equity investment in apm  an increase of million in accounts receivable due to the timing of our shipments and collections  and by an increase of million in inventories as we increased our inventory production to meet increasing demand from our customers 
our net cash provided by from operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  was million  which consisted primarily of our net loss of million  increased by depreciation and amortization expense of million  share based compensation expense of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to the timing of our shipments and collections and a decrease in inventories of million due to our operating initiatives in managing inventory levels 
these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a decrease of million in accrued liabilities as part of our efforts to manage spending 
cash flows used in investing activities our net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june   which was primarily attributable to million in purchases of property and equipment mainly to expand our in house packaging and testing production  million deposit for acquisition of wafer fabrication assets  million in equity investment in apm prior to the apm acquisition and million cash used  net of cash acquired in apm acquisition 
our net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june   which was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment of million  the majority of which was to expand our in house packaging and testing facility  and million in restricted cash deposited with a bank as required under our letters of credit 
our net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june  was million  which was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment of million  offset by a million release of the restricted cash required under our prior letters of credit with a bank 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities our net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended june  was million  which was principally attributable to million net repayments under our lines of credit  offset by million proceeds from exercise of employee share options and from espp 
our net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended june  was million  which was primarily attributable to net proceeds of million from the ipo  while we incurred approximately million in unpaid and accrued ipo related expenses at june  during fiscal year  we borrowed an aggregate of million from our a line of credit and paid off in full the then outstanding balance of million under our equipment term loan 
our net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended june  was million  which was primarily attributable to million in net borrowings under our equipment term loan  offset by million used to repurchase our common shares and million in principal payments on our capital leases 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures principally consisted of the purchases of property and equipment 
capital expenditures for fiscal years primarily consisted of purchases of packaging and testing equipment for our two in house manufacturing facilities and purchases of consigned equipment to a third party foundry 
following the acquisition of apm in december  we rely primarily on our in house capacities for packaging and testing our products and expect to do so in the future 
we utilize third party foundries for wafer fabrication  and our capital expenditures related to the wafer fabrication process are primarily for the purchases of certain specialized equipment that are consigned to our third party foundries to support our production requirement 
in august  we announced our intention to exercise an option to acquire certain assets associated with the idt 
table of contents wafer manufacturing facility  which is located in hillsboro  oregon for a total purchase price of million 
we have obtained this option as part of the consideration for us entering into a foundry service agreement with idt and a cash prepayment of million which will be applied to the purchase price 
the acquisition is subject to the execution of a definitive asset purchase agreement  which is expected to occur by the end of calendar year during the initial ramp up period of the idt facility  which is expected to last for approximately two to three quarters  we may incur additional costs and expenses relating to integration of the wafer fabrication facility  including costs for additional personnel  raw materials  equipment and other overhead expenses 
as we pursue a fab lite model and continue to grow our business  we expect to increase our capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity in order to reduce manufacturing cost and to provide better services to our customers 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table provides selected information regarding our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands capital leases operating leases capital commitments with respect to property and equipment purchase commitments with respect to inventory and research and development total contractual obligations as of june   we had recorded liabilities of million for uncertain tax positions and million for potential interest and penalty  which are not included in the above table because we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of payments in individual years that would be made in connection with these uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates  judgments and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition  inventory reserves  warranty accrual  income taxes  share based compensation  variable interest entities and useful lives for property and equipment and for intangible assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue when product is shipped to the customer  net of estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments to certain distributors 
we sell our products primarily to distributors  who in turn sell our products globally to various end customers 
our revenue is net of the effect of the estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that we expect to provide to certain 
table of contents distributors 
stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of the products purchased by distributors during a specified period 
we estimate provision for stock rotation returns based on historical returns and individual distributor agreements 
we also provide special pricing to certain distributors primarily based on volume  to encourage resale of our products 
we estimate the expected price adjustments at the time the revenue is recognized based on distributor inventory levels  pre approved future distributor selling prices  distributor margins and demand for our products 
if actual stock rotation returns or price adjustments differ from our estimates  adjustments may be recorded in the period when such actual information is known 
allowance for price adjustments is recorded as contra accounts receivable and provision for stock rotation is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from certain distributors is deferred until the distributor resells the products to end customers due to price protection adjustments and right of returns that cannot be reliably measured 
packaging and testing services revenue is recognized upon shipment of serviced products to the customer 
inventory reserves we carry inventories at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost primarily consists of semiconductor wafers  packaging and testing  personnel  including share based compensation expense  overhead attributable to manufacturing  operations and procurement  yield improvements  capacity utilization 
inventory reserves are made based on our periodic review of inventory quantities on hand as compared with our sales forecasts  historical usage  aging of inventories  production yield levels and current product selling prices 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those forecasted by us  additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and the products that have previously been written down are sold  our gross margin would be favorably impacted 
warranty accrual we provide a standard one year warranty for the products we sell 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacement product  freight costs for failed parts and their replacement and other quality assurance costs 
we monitor our product returns for warranty claims and maintain an accrual for the related warranty cost based on our historical data and anticipated warranty claims known at the time that the estimate is made 
if actual warranty costs differ significantly from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual would be required and any such adjustments could be material 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business 
we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies based on estimates of whether additional taxes may be due 
while the final tax outcome of these matters may differ from the amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made 
as a result  significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we consider evidence such as our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
we intend to maintain a partial valuation allowance equal to the state research and development credit carryfowards until sufficient 
table of contents positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
we have not provided for withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
as of june  the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings considered permanently reinvested is  the determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings is not practicable 
should we decide to remit this income to the bermuda parent company in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model  the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by changes in earnings or tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to reserves  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
share based compensation expense we recognize share based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the options determined by the black scholes option pricing model  using the accelerated vesting attribution method 
share based compensation expense is significant to the consolidated financial statements and is calculated using our best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
significant estimates include fair value of the underlying common shares prior to our ipo  expected term  share price volatility and forfeiture rates 
we established the expected term based on the historical data of similar entities data as adjusted for expected changes in future exercise patterns 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on historical average period of time that options were outstanding and forfeited 
we estimate expected volatility based on the volatility of similar entities whose shares are publicly available 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yields at the time of grant for periods corresponding to the expected term of the options 
the expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that we have not historically paid dividends and have no current intention to pay dividends 
prior to our ipo which became effective on april   the absence of a public market for our common shares required our compensation committee of the board of directors  the members of which we believe have extensive business  industry  finance and venture capital experience  to estimate the fair value of our common shares for the purpose of granting options and for determining share based compensation expense for the periods presented 
in response to these requirements  the compensation committee  with input from management  estimated the fair value of the common shares at each meeting when options were granted 
we commissioned an independent third party to conduct contemporaneous valuations to assist in the determination of the fair value of the common shares  except for the grant of options on march   the exercise price of which was determined after considering a preliminary valuation analysis provided to us by the representatives of our underwriters  the valuation of the common shares performed by an independent third party at december  and other factors 
our contemporaneous valuations  using the aicpa practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  employed a two step process to arrive at an estimate of the value of the common shares 
the first step of the analysis was to estimate the total enterprise value 
we primarily relied on an income approach  specifically a discounted cash flow analysis  to estimate the total enterprise value 
the discounted cash flow analysis involves applying appropriate risk adjusted discount rates to estimated cash flows  based on forecasted revenue and costs 
the assumptions used in connection 
table of contents with these valuations were based on our expected operating performance over the discrete forecast period 
a terminal value was estimated for the value of the business beyond the discrete forecasted earnings period 
this value was estimated by applying a multiple to our projections in the final year of the forecast period 
the multiple was selected based on the data of a peer group of public companies in the industry 
the discrete period cash flows and terminal value were then discounted to the present at our estimated cost of capital  which was developed through an analysis of required returns for companies in a similar stage of development 
the results of the income approach were tested for reasonableness based on an analysis of the multiples of similar public companies 
the second step was to allocate our total enterprise value to the preferred and common classes of securities based on the relative rights and preferences of each class 
we relied on the option pricing method  which treats the securities as call options on the underlying assets or enterprise value to allocate the enterprise value 
significant estimates required in the option pricing method include the expected time to liquidity  risk free interest rate for the expected time to liquidity  expected dividend yield  fair value of the aggregate enterprise value and expected volatility of the underlying enterprise value 
additionally  we considered a probability weighted expected return method to estimate the value of the common shares 
this methodology considers various scenarios of future exit events  including a public offering  sale  liquidation or remaining private 
an estimate of future exit periods and events are made and the exit values are allocated to each class of security based on the rights and preferences that would be exercised to maximize the value of each class  based on seniority 
the allocated values are then discounted to the present and weighted based on an assessment of the probability of each scenario 
probabilities of each scenario have been assessed by management at each date  based on consideration of then current market conditions and changes in the underlying prospects 
we also reviewed a variety of factors in determining the deemed fair value of the common shares such as our operating and financial performance  the introduction of new products  the price of the preferred share financings with third party investors in arm length transactions  the lack of a public market for its common shares  industry growth and volume  the performance of similarly situated companies in our industry and stock market indices  emerging trends and issues  trends in consumer confidence and spending  overall economic indicators and the general economic outlook 
variable interest entities and investment in apm we evaluate all transactions and relationships with potential variable interest entities vies to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entities  therefore is required to consolidate with vies 
our overall methodology for evaluating transactions and relationships under the vie requirements includes the following two steps determine whether the entity meets the criteria to qualify as a vie  and determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
in performing the first step  we consider the significant factors and judgments in making the determination as to whether an entity is a vie include the design of the entity  including the nature of its risks and the purpose for which the entity was created  to determine the variability that the entity was designed to create and distribute to its interest holders  the nature of our involvement with the entity  whether control of the entity may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting equity  whether there is sufficient equity investment at risk to finance the activities of the entity  and whether parties other than the equity holders have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns 
for each vie identified  we then perform the second step and evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie by considering the following significant factors and judgments whether our variable interest absorbs the majority of the vie expected losses  whether our variable interest receives the majority of the vie expected returns  and whether we have the ability to make decisions that significantly affect the vie results and activities 
based on our evaluation of the above factors and judgments  no vies were identified as of june  prior to the apm acquisition on december   we had a equity interest in apm which had been identified as a vie  however  we were not the primary beneficiary and therefore we did not consolidate apm 
the equity interest in apm was accounted for 
table of contents using the equity method through the date of acquisition 
estimated useful lives for property and equipment and intangible assets property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets 
patents and exclusive technology rights purchased from third parties are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years 
identified intangibles acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of three to four years 
prior to december   the apm acquisition date  the company manufacturing machinery and equipment were depreciated over a useful life of years 
upon the completion of the apm acquisition  the company revised the estimated useful life of its manufacturing machinery and equipment for depreciation purposes from years to years on a prospective basis 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
we are required to adopt this guidance as of the beginning of the adoption of this guidance will only impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this amendment clarifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendment also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendment is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements for business combinations in our fiscal year effective january   we adopted certain provisions of the fasb updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which require new disclosures about significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level fair value measurements 
the updated guidance also clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding inputs and valuation techniques  as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities for which separate fair value measurements should be disclosed 
the guidance was effective january   except for the separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level measurements  which are effective for our financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of the updated guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and the deferred provisions are not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we and our principal subsidiaries use us dollars as our functional currency because most of the transactions are conducted and settled in us dollars 
all of our revenue and a significant portion of our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
the functional currency for our in house packaging and testing facilities in china is us dollars and a significant majority of our capital expenditures are denominated in us dollars 
however  foreign currencies are required to fund our overseas operations  primarily in taiwan and china 
operating expenses of overseas operations are denominated in their respective local currencies 
in order to minimize exposure to foreign currencies  we maintained cash and cash equivalent balances in foreign currencies  including chinese yuan rmb as operating funds for our foreign operating expenses 
our management believes that our exposure to foreign currency translation risk is not significant based on a sensitivity analysis in foreign currencies due to the net assets denominated in foreign currencies pertaining to foreign operations  principally in taiwan and china  are not significant to our consolidated net assets 
interest rate risk our interest bearing assets comprise mainly interest bearing short term bank balances 
we manage our interest rate risk by placing such balances in instruments with various short term maturities 
borrowings expose us to interest rate risk 
borrowings are drawn down after due consideration of market conditions and expectation of future interest rate movements 
in the past  our borrowings have been subject to floating interest rates  and future borrowings may expose us to cash flow interest rate risk 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would materially affect our results of operations as we had no outstanding borrowings at june
