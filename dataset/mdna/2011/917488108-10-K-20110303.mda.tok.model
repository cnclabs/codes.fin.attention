item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
overview despite a decline in consolidated sales and a decline in eps in  utmd continued excellent overall financial performance 
the profitability allowed the company to continue utmd s consistent long term program of providing excellent shareholder returns including payment of dividends and share repurchases 
measures of the company s liquidity and overall financial condition in built on an already strong condition at the end of for example  utmd s current ratio current assets to current liabilities remained high at despite payment of a  special dividend to shareholders just before the end of the year 
utmd s total debt ratio total liabilities to total assets decreased to from at the end of despite the fact that utmd paid out all of its net profits in dividends to shareholders in shareholder dividends reduce a company s net worth 
ending days in accounts receivable decreased to from and a r over days from invoice date declined to of total receivables from at the end of inventory balances declined more than sales  yielding higher inventory turns 
consolidated global sales were down the decline was due to weaker domestic business  primarily as a result of lower physician preference device utilization rates in us hospitals 
international sales increased in after a decline of in utmd s largest international customer in purchased  in utmd bpm devices in  compared to only in but in international sales of neonatal devices in increased by or 
utmd believes that international sales will continue to lead its growth in notwithstanding  there are a number of significant risk factors that may negatively impact utmd s international sales  including those listed above un der risk factors 
utmd s ireland subsidiary shipped of utmd s total international sales in compared to in the difference was essentially due to variation in foreign exchange rates 
if the average conversion rate of utmd ltd shipments had been the same in as  it would have added to international sales and ireland s portion of total international sales would have been 
in usd terms  utmd ltd shipped of utmd s global sales in  and generated of utmd s consolidated net profits 
this compares to of global sales and of net profits in domestic sales  comprised of domestic oem and domestic direct sales  declined  or about 
domestic oem sales were down as other companies reduced inventories in domestic direct sales declined  primarily due to lower hospital utilization rates of utmd s physician preference devices 
in order to reduce manufacturing overhead costs going forward  utmd completed a  expansion of its utah facilities  and consolidated oregon operations into utah during operating expenses continued to be rationalized relative to the changing environment  resulting in operating expenses in of about as a ratio of sales 
non operating income was lower in compared to as a result of low interest rates on utmd s cash deposits  but the income tax provision rate was also about percentage points of ebt earnings before taxes lower compared to the consolidated tax rate in the lower tax provision rate was primarily due to a larger portion of consolidated pretax income generated in ireland at much lower income tax rates than in the us due to a slow economic recovery and continued low interest rates  utmd expects that its non operating income may be even lower in  but still targets a net profit margin close to of sales in productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  at the end of the decrease was due to a decrease in year end cash and investment balances 
in  utmd repurchased  of its shares for and paid  in dividends to shareholders 
in  utmd repurchased  of its shares for and paid  in dividends to shareholders 
productivity of total assets average total asset turns total sales divided by average total assets for the year was compared to in both years asset turns were diminished by utmd s substantial cash equivalent balances 
year end and cash and investment balances were  and  representing and of total assets  respectively 
excluding average cash and investment balances  average total asset turns were in and in in  total assets excluding cash and investment balances are expected to remain less than annual sales  which benefits return on average shareholders equity roe 
property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah and ireland manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and facilities 
in  net consolidated pp e depreciated book value of all fixed assets increased as a result of in depreciation  capital expenditures of  and the effect of currency exchange rates on pp e in ireland 
the net book value of pp e in the us increased  and in ireland decreased the year end net book value after accumulated depreciation of consolidated pp e was of actual acquisition cost 
since utmd s pp e is in good working order and capable of suppor ting increased sales activity  the continued productivity of fixed assets will remain a source of future profitability 
in  the utah facility was expanded to house the transfer of equipment from consolidation of oregon operations 
in  new pp e purchases are not expected to exceed depreciation of fixed assets 
despite lower sales  year end inventories decreased from the beginning of the year  and average inventory turns improved to from in net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end trade accounts receivable a r balances decreased  or 
the resulting average days in a r on december  of days  based on q shipments  was down from days at the end of this performance remained well within management s continuing objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date at year end were of total a r  down from at the end of the company believes the older a r will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end the difference was mainly due to a decrease in cash and investments and a decrease in inventories 
both of those year end working capital amounts exceed utmd s needs for internally financing growth in normal operations 
utmd s year end current ratio decreased to from primarily due to the use of cash for a one time special dividend near the end of which reduced cash by  more than the dividend which was paid at the end of for the year  utmd paid  in shareholder cash dividends  compared to  during noncash year end working capital was  in and  in although the current ratio in may be diminished by use of cash for share repurchases  dividends or an acquisition  utmd expects that current assets will continue to be a healthy multiple of current liabilities 
net after accumulated amortization intangible assets  which are comprised of goodwill resulting from acquisitions and the costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property including technology rights  were  at the end of compared to  at the end of utmd s goodwill balance remained at  under current gaap  goodwill is not expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three acquisitions of  and continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business  representing of total sales in when including derivative new devices that ensued the acquisitions 
utmd does not expect the current intangible value of goodwill associated with the acquisitions to become impaired i n purchases of other intangibles of in were offset by in amortization expense 
net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets  the same as at the end of b liabilities 
in  utmd s total liabilities decreased from the end of the resulting end total debt ratio was  compared to at the end of total liabilities decreased by primarily because the note payable by utmd s ireland subsidiary  utmd s only debt  declined by in book value compared to actual principal payments of the difference resulted from currency exchange in the value of the usd compared to the euro 
in euro terms all euro amounts in this report are in thousands  the note payable declined from  at the end of to at the end of as a reminder to shareholders  the note was initiated in december to finance repatriation of profits achieved in ireland since through under the american jobs creation act of utmd ltd 
ireland estimates that it will repay this note from profits generated by its operations over the next three years 
year end consolidated current liabilities were higher than at year end as a result of normal timing differences in year end accruals and payables 
in addition to liabilities on the balance sheet  utmd has operating lease and purchase obligations described in note results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales in were  compared to  in and  in domestic sales were  in  compared to  in and  in utmd divides its domestic sales into two distribution categories direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part of another company s finished product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct domestic sales were in all three years of  and therefore  domestic oem sales were of total domestic sales in each year 
domestic direct sales r epresented of global consolidated sales in  compared to in and in international foreign sales in were  compared to  in and  in international sales were of global consolidated sales in  in and in of the international sales  were to customers in europe compared to in and in utmd s ireland subsidiary utmd ltd 
shipped of international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in utmd ltd 
trade shipments were up in euro terms  and down in usd terms  compared to utmd groups its sales into four general product categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial tissue sampling  transvaginal uterine sonography  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal critical care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including providing vascular access  enteral feeding  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors enjoy a significant market share and may have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a summary description of revenues in the above tables obstetrics 
the decline in total obstetrics l d device sales in was primarily the result of a lower utilization of specialty devices in us hospitals  which utmd estimates was down about in the us hospital decline in utilization now seems to have stabilized 
in addition  restrictive us gpo administrative agreements continue to violate the mandate by the us senate judiciary antitrust subcommittee in april that gpos only allow multi source contracting and not bundle unlike products when it comes to clinician preference devices 
in the us  sales of flagship intran plus intrauterine pressure catheters iupcs declined utmd estimates that about of the decline resulted from lower utilizati on rates in accounts which remain utmd customers 
of the remaining  about was due to lost business from restrictive gpo agreements and from lower prices 
the silver lining of this decline is that the company s reliance on a single product is much less concentrated  ie  in  us intran iupc sales were of total sales compared to when us iupc sales were of total sales 
domestic gynecology electrosurgery urology es gyn product sales decreased  while international es gyn sales declined 
as a result of the american society for colposcopy and cervical pathology asccp revised guidelines for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  which advised greater monitoring of lower grade lesions in lieu of surgical treatment  in the us utmd observed approximately a decline in use of letz electrodes from a consistent gynecology customer base 
the effect of the new guidelines now seems to have stabilized 
the decline in es gyn international sales was due to cessation of purchase of utmd s finesse esu in china 
sales of esus to china were in  in and in this illustrates the risk of selling proprietary devices into the china market  as it is only a matter of time before the product is copied 
ignoring the china distribution change  es gyn international sales increased by 
neonatal critical care device nicu sales increased internationally and decreased in the us hospital utilization rates in the us were lower  whereas international market opportunities for increased nicu device sales continue to exist 
blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm 
us bpm sales decreased  while international bpm sales increased 
ninety six percent of utmd s domestic oem sales were included in the bpm category 
domestic oem sales decreased compared to the bpm category includes molded components some of which are not related to medical devices sold to other companies for use in their products 
in contrast to the other product categories  international sales of bpm devices comprise most in and in of utmd s bpm sales 
utmd s bpm sales depend heavily on successful marketing by international distributors 
utmd s largest internatio nal customer in purchased in compared to in and  in the us dollar was about stronger on the average relative to the euro in than in if the average conversion rate of utmd ltd shipments in had been the same as in  it would have added to international sales and international sales as a whole would have been up 
looking forward to  utmd anticipates a slow worldwide economic recovery  continued pressure on prices and continued austere utilization in us hospitals 
excluding the possibility of an acquisition of a new product line with established sales  utmd management projects overall revenues in about the same as in this assumes a continued small decline in domestic sales offset by an increase in international sales 
b gross profit 
utmd s gross profit  the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products from net revenues  was  compared to  in and  in gross profit margins gpms  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in and in the gpm in was lower for several reasons the absolute cost of direct materials in the us increased while sales declined 
in addition  labor productivity in utah declined slightly 
a significant part of this was due to start up costs of injection molding operations in utah which were previously in oregon 
because many of utmd s manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed in order to preserve capabilities  the lower consolidated sales activity in had a higher overhead content 
utmd continues to maintain facilities and other manufacturing infrastructure well in excess of its current needs  which will help improve gpm when sales do increase 
ireland subsidiary gross profits are disproportionately lower than total utmd gross profits because all of the finished devices sold by utmd ltd are to third party international distributors at heavily discounted wholesale prices  the bpm devices themselves are generally commodities now  and the costs of manufacturing in ireland  in particular labor related costs  are higher than in utah 
ireland subsidiary gross profits in euros were in compared to in and in the associated gpms were in  in and in in the second half of  after review of accounting principles  utmd reallocated its expenses of shipping products to customers previously included in cost of goods sold manufacturing expense to sales and marketing operating expense 
this reallocation of expenses did not impact operating profits  ebt or net income 
the net impact of this accounting change was to increase the company s gross profit margin by about for the year relative to what it would have been prior to the reallocation of shipping expenses 
the following table illustrates the change cost of goods sold prior to reallocation percent of sales reallocated shipping costs cost of goods sold as reported percent of sales as a result of continued pricing pressure from us hospitals  growth in sales coming primarily from lower margin international business  higher cost of employee benefits including medical plan costs and unemployment taxes  and inflation in the cost of raw materials  utmd does not expect to improve its gpm in utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because  in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
c operating income 
operating income is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
combined operating expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in the following table provides a comparison of operating expense categories for the last three years 
note that there were shipping expenses of in s m expense in that were not included in s m expenses in and  as explained above 
s m expenses r d expenses g a a litigation expense provision g a b corporate legal expenses g a c stock option compensation expense g a d management bonus accrual g a e outside accounting audit tax expenses g a f all other expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses operating income in was  compared to  in and  in utmd s operating profit margin operating income divided by total sales was in  compared to in and in looking forward to  utmd projects an operating profit margin about the same as in i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows  processing orders  paying commissions to outside representatives and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing inside representatives and paying commissions to outside reps that solicit product sales and provide customer support across the us  the decline in s m expenses primarily reflects fewer inside direct sales representatives 
as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in without the reallocation of in shipping expenses described above  s m expenses would have been  or of sales 
in  with shipping expenses included in s m for the full year  utmd expects the ratio of s m expenses to total sales will be about 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing premarketing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were in compared to in and in utmd will continue to opportunistically invest in r d 
in  r d expenses should remain about the same as as a percentage of sales 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  corporate risk management  protection of intellectual property and legal costs 
aggregate g a expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in except for the categories of g a expenses isolated in the table above  utmd s g a expenses have remained consistent over the last three years 
the following lettered items refer to the same g a subcategories in the table above a absent unforeseen litigation  utmd expects a litigation expense provision in about the same as in b the higher corporate legal expenses were essentially due to the legal costs associated with the filing of sec form s  registration statement under the securities act of that year 
in  utmd expects routine expenses consistent with those in c stock option expense in was calculated using a black scholes pricing model for unvested options 
please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
in  utmd expects option expense about lower than in d the main difference in management bonus accrual compared to and was due to the fact that utmd s ceo did not receive a management bonus 
accrued bonuses in will continue to depend both on utmd s overall profit performance and each individual employee s contribution to the financial and non financial success of the company 
e utmd s personnel  fundamental business activities  internal control systems and financial reporting mechanisms have remained relatively unchanged over the last several years 
management expects financial and internal controls audit and tax consulting costs will be about the same as costs 
d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income noi includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which include interest on the ireland bank loan  bank service fees and excise taxes 
noi was in  compared to in and in utmd expects total noi will be approximately the estimated noi may be lower if utmd utilizes its invested cash for an acquisition  unexpected litigation costs or substantial share repurchases 
investment of excess cash 
investment income including gains and losses on sales in was  compared to in and in in  average interest rates were much lower than prior years 
capital gains or losses and dividends from investments in common stocks were in  in and in the company holds investments in citigroup c  general electric ge and lockheed martin lmt common stock which together were about below their aggregate purchase price at the end of when purchased  these holdings at cost represented less than of utmd s total investment portfolio 
at the end of  they represented less than of utmd s total investment portfolio 
unless one or all of the co mpanies fail  utmd will not sell the holdings at current prices  expecting that the current value is immaterial and they may recover somewhat in value 
therefore  utmd does not expect an associated noi loss which impacts earnings 
currently  of utmd s cash investments are being held in interest bearing money market securities yielding about 
royalties 
there were no royalties received in and  compared to received in the royalties resulted from the license of patents which expired during presently  there are no other patents under which utmd is receiving royalties from other parties 
interest expense 
in  utmd paid in interest expense on the ireland loan  compared to in and in the interest expense results from borrowing   in december to allow the repatriation of profits generated by utmd s ireland subsidiary since inception in through due to a lower loan balance and expected higher interest rates  utmd estimates that its interest expense should be about the same in as in other noi 
income received from renting underutilized warehouse space in ireland and parking lot space in utah for a cell phone tower  offset by bank fees and excise taxes  was in  in and in conservatively estimating its ability to rent warehouse space in  utmd expects other noi will be about in earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating income 
consolidated ebt was  in  compared to  in and  in ebt margin is ebt divided by total sales 
utmd s ebt margin was in  in and in the ebt of utmd ltd 
was in  in and in utmd is targeting consolidated ebt and ebt margin about the same as in e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was  in   in and  in the effective consolidated corporate income tax provision rate was  and for the same periods respectively 
year to year fluctuations in the tax rate may result from variations in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products and a rate on rental and other types of income  special us tax exclusions such as the manufacturing profit deduction  higher marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other permanent factors such as r d tax credits 
management expects the consolidated income tax provision rate to be close to the rate 
utmd s net profit margin net income expressed as a percentage of sales was in  in and in utmd s profitability has consistently ranked it in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been a primary driver for utmd s past excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the applicable period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were in  in and in if utmd achieves the projections above  eps in will be approximately the same as in the ending weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands  compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was shares in thousands  compared to in and in actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe for was zero because in utmd paid out all of its net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends 
prior to the payment of dividends  utmd s roe was 
roe was before dividends  in roe was before dividends excluding the fifth dividend payment in the fifth dividend payment normally would have been paid in january utm d s roe is primarily driven by its high net profit margin 
roe before dividends was reduced by a lower debt ratio as utmd continued to reduce its bank loan balance in ireland  and by slightly lower total asset turns 
utmd s roe before dividends has averaged per year over the last years 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without diluting shareholder interest 
for example  a roe will financially support annual growth in revenues without having to issue more stock 
in  as utmd did not need additional capital to finance growth  it could afford to pay out all of its earnings to shareholders 
looking forward  unless utmd utilizes its cash to make an acquisition or repurchase shares  roe before dividends will be lower than because net profits will be about the same  financial leverage will be lower as debt is repaid and asset utilization will be lower by increasing cash balances assets with about the same amount of sales 
in other words  retaining a high cash balance which returns less than dilutes overall roe 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options  totaled  in  compared to  in and  in compared to  net cash provided by operating activities in was similar down just the largest changes were net income being lower and reduction in inventories providing more cash in compared to other changes were generally consistent with effective working capital management in the presence of lower sales activity 
the company s use of cash for investing activities in was split quite evenly between capital expenditures of  for property and equipment and  as a result of purchases of liquid investments in an effort to maximize returns on excess cash balances while maintaining safety and liquidity 
in comparison  utmd made capital expenditures of in and in for property and equipment  and expended  in and  in on investments 
the large difference in capital expenditures in compared to the two prior years was due to utmd s  investment in facility expansion in order to consolidate oregon operations into utah 
in  utmd received  from selling investments  compared to  in and  in no acquisition of another company requiring investment of cash was made in any of the three years 
in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
employees exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options 
the company received a tax benefit from option exercises in utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in comparison  in utmd received from issuing  share s of stock on the exercise of employee stock options  including  shares retired upon optionees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon optionees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
utmd received a tax benefit in from option exercises  and a benefit of in utmd did not borrow during  or in december  utmd s foreign subsidiary borrowed   to allow repatriation from ireland to the us of profits achieved since  per the american jobs creation act of in  the bank of ireland loan terms were modified to no longer require a guarantee by utmd s line of credit in the us in  utmd made repayments of on the ireland note  compared to in and  in management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans 
in an uncertain economic environment  utmd s cash balances allow management to operate with the long term best interest of shareholders in mind 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be more consistent with years before since expansion of utmd s utah facility has been completed 
management plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following in general  to invest at an opportune time in ways that will enhance future profitability  to make investments in new technology and or processes  and or to acquire a product line or company that will augment revenue and eps growth and better utilize utmd s existing infrastructure 
if there are no better strategic uses for utmd s cash  the company will continue to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases when the stock appears undervalued 
management outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to work to retain its significant market niche shares of its established key specialty products in the us  and expand market shares in international markets  continue to promote clinical acceptance of newer products  develop additional proprietary products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development  continue achieving excellent overall financial operating performance  look for accretive acquisitions to augment sales and eps growth  and utilize current cash balances in shareholders best long term interest  including continued cash dividends and open market share repurchases when the utmd share price seems undervalued 
the safety  reliability and performance of utmd s medical devices are high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with clinicians who use its specialty devices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed business partners 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
utmd s passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks  particularly for women and their babies 
the company has a fundamental focus to do an excellent job in meeting customers and patients needs  while providing shareholders with excellent returns 
despite utmd s decline in eps in recent years  looking back ten years to the end of  utmd s eps have increased from 
to and the year ending share price has more than tripled up from share to share 
combining a long term steady performance with growing dividends since  longer term utmd shareholders have experienced excellent returns 
in comparison  the nasdaq composite and djia were each up just over while the s p index declined over that same ten year time span 
in  the year ending share price declined 
however  utmd increased normal dividends share by and paid a special dividend at the end of the year representing approximately the magnitude of one year s total dividend 
this was accomplished by utmd continuing to achieve a high positive cash flow 
utmd s balance sheet remains strong enough to be able to finance a substantial acquisition in without issuing stock  should an immediately accretive one become available 
utmd looks to acquire reasonably valued  cash flow positive companies with established products or technologies that will enhance utmd s specialist focus  but not significantly increase business risk and not dilute financial performance 
off balance sheet arrangements none contractual obligations the following is a summary of utmd s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  long term debt obligations are comprised solely of future payments required to pay off the ireland note contractual obligations and commitments total and thereafter long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management has identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of the company s receivables are with us hospitals and medical device distributors 
although the company has historically not had significant write offs of bad debt  the possibility exists  particularly with foreign customers where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread us hospital bankruptcies 
inventory valuation reserves the company strives to maintain a good balance of inventory to meets its customer s needs and optimize manufacturing lot sizes while not tying up an unnecessary amount of the company s capital increasing the possibility of  among other things  obsolescence 
the company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve 
while the company has historically not had significant inventory write offs  the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created 
the company s historical write offs have not been materially different from its estimates 
accounting policy changes the company s management has evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and has determined that the application of these pronouncements will not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations
