overview our company 
digital realty trust  inc completed its initial public offering of common stock  or our ipo  on november  we believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify  and have elected to be treated  as a reit under sections through of the code 
our company was formed on march  during the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our ipo  we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of digital realty trust  inc common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of the company 
our operating partnership was formed on july  business and strategy 
our primary business objectives are to maximize i sustainable long term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit and ii cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our operating partnership s unitholders  including through the payment of distributions 
we expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of investing in and redeveloping technology related real estate 
a significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for redevelopment and new properties 
we target high quality  strategically located properties containing applications and operations critical to the day to day operations of corporate enterprise datacenter and technology industry tenants and properties that may be redeveloped for such use 
most of our properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems  multiple power feeds  above standard precision cooling systems  raised floor areas  extensive in building communications cabling and high level security systems 
we focus solely on technology related real estate because we believe that the growth in corporate datacenter adoption and the technology related real estate industry generally will continue to be superior to that of the overall economy 
as of december   we owned an aggregate of technology related real estate properties  excluding two properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  with approximately million rentable square feet including approximately million square feet of space held for redevelopment 
at december   approximately  square feet of our space held for redevelopment was under construction for turn key datacenter  powered base building and build to suit space in seven us markets and three european markets 
we have developed detailed  standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions to ensure that they meet our financial  technical and other criteria 
we expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a part of our growth strategy 
we intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow 
we intend to continue to build out our redevelopment portfolio when justified by anticipated returns 
we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties 
debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to digital realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock 
we currently intend to limit our indebtedness to of our total enterprise value and  based on 
table of contents the closing price of digital realty trust  inc s common stock on december  of  our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately as of december  our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of digital realty trust  inc s outstanding common stock which may decrease  thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio  excluding options issued under our company s incentive award plan  plus the liquidation value of digital realty trust  inc s preferred stock  plus the aggregate value of our operating partnership s units not held by digital realty trust  inc with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of its common stock and excluding long term incentive units and class c units  plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness 
revenue base 
as of december   we owned properties through our operating partnership  excluding two properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
these properties are mainly located throughout the us  with properties located in europe  one property in asia and one property in canada 
we  through our predecessor  acquired our first portfolio property in january and have added properties as follows year ended december properties acquired net rentable square feet square feet of space held for redevelopment as of december  properties owned as of december  excludes properties sold in and technology center drive march  valley view lane march and east tufts avenue july 
also excludes a leasehold interest acquired in march related to an acquisition made in current net rentable square feet as of december   which represents the current square feet at buildings under lease as specified in the applicable lease agreements plus management s estimate of space available for lease based on engineering drawings 
includes tenants proportional share of common areas but excludes space held for redevelopment 
redevelopment space is unoccupied space that requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use 
most often this is shell space 
however  in certain circumstances this may include partially built datacenter space that was not completed by previous ownership and requires a large capital investment in order to build out the space 
the amounts included in this table represent redevelopment space as of december  in the properties acquired during the relevant period 
includes a developed building devin shafron drive placed into service in that is being included with a property devin shafron buildings that was acquired in as of december   the properties in our portfolio were approximately leased excluding million square feet held for redevelopment 
due to the capital intensive and long term nature of the operations being supported  our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases 
as of december   our original average lease term was approximately years  with an average of approximately seven years remaining 
the majority of our leasing since the completion of our ipo has been at lease terms shorter than years 
our lease expirations through december  are of rentable square feet excluding space held for redevelopment as of december  
table of contents operating revenues from properties outside the united states were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  no single foreign country comprised more than of total revenues 
factors which may influence future results of operations global market and economic conditions in the united states and globally  market and economic conditions have been unprecedented over the past few years and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth in all markets in which we own properties and conduct our operations 
the us and global economies have experienced a recession and face continued concerns about the systemic impact of adverse economic conditions  such as high energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  unstable global financial and mortgage markets  high corporate  consumer and governmental debt levels  high unemployment and declining residential and commercial real estate markets 
as a result of these conditions  general economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital have been and may again be adversely affected in some or all of the markets in which we own properties and conduct our operations 
renewed or increased turbulence in the us  european and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability  and the ability of our tenants  to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis  access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our  and our tenants  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our access to funds under our revolving credit facility and other lines of credit depend on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us 
we cannot assure you that long term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among  and potential failures or nationalizations of  third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders 
if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us  our business  results of operation  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds  access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital  we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity 
such alternatives may include  without limitation  curtailing development or redevelopment activity  disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would 
rental income 
the amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations 
excluding million square feet held for redevelopment  as of december   the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio was approximately of our net rentable square feet 
the amount of rental income generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
included in our approximately million net rentable square feet  excluding redevelopment space  at december  is approximately  net rentable square feet of space with extensive datacenter improvements that is currently  or will shortly be  available for lease 
since our ipo  we have leased approximately  square feet of similar space 
these turn key datacenters are effective solutions for tenants who lack the expertise or capital budget to provide their own extensive datacenter infrastructure and security 
our expertise in datacenter construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a significant premium over other uses 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately million square feet of redevelopment space  or approximately of the total rentable space in our portfolio  including five vacant properties comprising approximately  square feet 
our ability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to redevelop space and lease redevelopment space at favorable rates  which we may not be able to obtain 
redevelopment space requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter 
table of contents facilities that are ready for use and  in addition  we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for redevelopment space 
we may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant redevelopment space in the future 
we will require additional capital to finance our redevelopment activities  which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us  including as a result of the conditions described above under global market and economic conditions 
economic downturns  including as a result of the conditions described above under global market and economic conditions  or regional downturns affecting our sub markets or downturns in the technology related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re lease space  or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments  as in the case of tenant bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
as of december   we had no material tenants in bankruptcy 
scheduled lease expirations 
our ability to re lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations 
in addition to approximately million square feet of available space in our portfolio  which excludes approximately million square feet available for redevelopment as of december   leases representing approximately and of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december  and  respectively 
market concentration 
we depend on the market for technology based real estate in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional markets can impact our future results 
as of december   our portfolio was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan markets metropolitan market percentage of december  total annualized rent silicon valley northern virginia san francisco chicago new york metro phoenix dallas boston los angeles london  england dublin  ireland paris  france other annualized rent is monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of december  multiplied by operating expenses 
our operating expenses generally consist of utilities  property and ad valorem taxes  property management fees  insurance and site maintenance costs  as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases 
in particular  our buildings require significant power to support the datacenter operations contained in them 
many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us 
however  we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses and real estate taxes under our leases for turn key datacenters 
we also incur general and administrative expenses  including expenses relating to our asset management function  as well as significant legal  accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance  sec 
table of contents reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance 
we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand 
climate change legislation 
in june  the us house of representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas  or ghg  emissions  create new clean energy jobs and enhance the energy independence of the united states  which included a cap and trade program for ghg emissions 
the us senate did not pass similar legislation during or  and following congressional elections in november in which control of the house of representatives passed from the democratic party to the republican party  the likelihood that congress will pass any climate change and or energy legislation that would include a cap and trade program  or any similar type program  for ghg emissions in has diminished 
as a result  action to reduce ghg emissions likely will be focused on regulatory agencies  primarily the us environmental protection agency  or epa  and state actions 
the epa has been moving aggressively to regulate ghg emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources  including electricity producers  using its own authority under the clean air act 
some of those regulations have been finalized and currently are in litigation 
states have also taken actions to regulate ghg emissions 
for example  california enacted ab  the global warming solutions act of  which established the first statewide program in the united states to limit ghg emissions and impose penalties for non compliance 
the california air resources board  or carb  has taken  and plans to take  various actions to implement ab  including the approval in december of an ab scoping plan summarizing the main ghg reduction strategies for california 
carb approved in december a ghg cap and trade program  which is scheduled to take effect in as another example of state action  the western climate initiative  which currently includes seven states and four canadian provinces  has developed ghg reduction strategies  among them a ghg cap and trade program 
in addition  since the european union including the united kingdom has been operating under a cap and trade program  which directly affects the largest emitters of greenhouse gases  including electricity producers from whom we purchase power 
any additional taxation or regulation of energy use  including as a result of i new legislation that congress may pass  ii the regulations that the us epa has proposed or finalized  iii regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass  or iv any further reductions in the eu greenhouse gas cap could significantly increase our costs  and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our tenants 
interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt  all of which was mortgage debt subject to interest rate cap or swap agreements  and million was outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
the availability of debt and equity capital has significantly decreased as a result of the circumstances described above under global market and economic conditions 
the effects on commercial real estate mortgages  if available  include  but may not be limited to higher loan spreads  tightened loan covenants  reduced loan to value ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments 
potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations  potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets 
increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations  which could further increase our interest expense 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to digital realty trust  inc s stockholders necessary to maintain its qualification as a reit 
demand for datacenter space 
our portfolio of properties consists primarily of technology related real estate and datacenter real estate in particular 
a decrease in the demand for  or increase in supply of  datacenter space  internet gateway facilities or other technology related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use 
our redevelopment activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns  including recessions and the other circumstances described above under global market and economic conditions  as well as adverse developments in the corporate datacenter  internet and data communications and 
table of contents broader technology industries 
any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate it spending or reduced demand for datacenter space 
reduced demand could also result from business relocations  including to markets that we do not currently serve 
changes in industry practice or in technology  such as virtualization technology  more efficient computing or networking devices  or devices that require higher power densities than today s devices  could also reduce demand for the physical datacenter space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable 
in addition  the development of new technologies  the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses  thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases  become insolvent or file for bankruptcy 
in addition  demand for datacenter space in our properties  or the rates at which we lease space  may be adversely impacted either across our portfolio or in specific submarkets as a result of an increase in the number of competitors  or the amount of space being offered in our markets and other markets by our competitors 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report 
investments in real estate acquisition of real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the property and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases  any debt or deferred taxes assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations 
for example  if we were to allocate more value to land  there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of in place tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time 
this potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to in place tenant leases are amortized over the estimated term including renewal and extension assumptions of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of the value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place tenant leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
useful lives of assets 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our 
table of contents investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
asset impairment evaluation 
we review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner the property is being used in its physical condition or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development  or a history of operating or cash flow losses 
when such impairment indictors exist  we review an estimate of the future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition and compare to the carrying value of the property 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether a property is recoverable  our strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
we generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset  which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
revenue recognition rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases 
deferred rents included in our consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that would be received under the remaining terms of the leases 
many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us 
however  we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses  other than utility expense  and real estate taxes under our leases for turn key datacenters 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease  effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized  assuming collection is not considered doubtful 
as discussed above  we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 

table of contents share based awards we recognize compensation expense related to share based awards 
we generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award 
the calculation of the fair value of share based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility  dividend payments and future company results 
these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period

analysis of liquidity and capital resources our parent company s business is operated primarily through our operating partnership of which our parent company is the sole general partner and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes 
because our parent company operates on a consolidated basis with our operating partnership  the section entitled liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of our parent company on a consolidated basis and how our company is operated as a whole 
our parent company issues public equity from time to time  but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself  other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership 
our parent company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of indebtedness of our operating partnership  and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of our operating partnership 
therefore  the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of our parent company and our operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements  except for immaterial differences related to cash  other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by our parent company 
however  all debt is held directly or indirectly at the operating partnership level 
our parent company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred shares 
our parent company s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from our operating partnership 
as the sole general partner of our operating partnership  our parent company has the full  exclusive and complete responsibility for our operating partnership s day to day management and control 
our parent company causes our operating partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our parent company may in its 
table of contents discretion determine  in the manner provided in our operating partnership s partnership agreement 
our parent company receives proceeds from its equity issuances from time to time  but is required by our operating partnership s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to our operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of our operating partnership 
our parent company is a well known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on may   as amended by post effective amendment no 
filed on november   that allows our parent company to register unspecified various classes of equity securities 
as circumstances warrant  our parent company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis  dependent upon market conditions and available pricing 
any proceeds from such equity issuances would be contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our operating partnership 
our operating partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties  to fund development and redevelopment opportunities and for general working capital purposes  including potentially for the repurchase  redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or preferred securities 
the liquidity of our parent company is dependent on our operating partnership s ability to make sufficient distributions to our parent company 
the primary cash requirement of our parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders 
our parent company also guarantees some of our operating partnership s unsecured debt 
if our operating partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements  which trigger parent company guarantee obligations  then our parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees 
however  our parent company s only asset is its investment in our operating partnership 
we believe our operating partnership s sources of working capital  specifically its cash flow from operations  and borrowings available under its unsecured revolving credit facility  are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our parent company and  in turn  for our parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders 
however  we cannot assure you that our operating partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs  including its ability to make distribution payments to our parent company 
the unavailability of capital could adversely affect our operating partnership s ability to pay its distributions to our parent company  which would in turn  adversely affect our parent company s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders 
on december   our parent company entered into equity distribution agreements  which we refer to as the original equity distribution agreements  with each of citigroup global markets inc  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated and credit suisse securities usa llc  or the original agents  under which it could issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to  from time to time through  at its discretion  any of the original agents as its sales agents

incorporated as its sales agents 
the sales of common stock made under the equity distribution agreements will be made in at the market offerings as defined in rule of the securities act

future uses of cash our parent company may from time to time seek to retire  redeem or repurchase its preferred equity or the debt securities of our operating partnership through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  redemptions or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions or other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
we are also subject to the commitments discussed below under dividends and distributions 
dividends and distributions our parent company is required to distribute of its taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order for it to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  our parent company intends to make  but is not contractually bound to make  regular quarterly distributions to its preferred stockholders and common stockholders from cash flow from our operating partnership s operating activities 
all such distributions are at the discretion of our parent company s board of directors 
our parent company considers market factors and our operating partnership s performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels 
our parent company has distributed of its taxable income since inception to minimize corporate level federal income taxes 
amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest bearing accounts and short term interest bearing securities  which are consistent with our intention to maintain our parent company s status as a reit 
the exchange rate on the debentures  the exchange rate on the debentures  the conversion rate on our parent company s series c cumulative convertible preferred stock and the conversion rate on our parent company s series d cumulative convertible preferred stock are each subject to adjustment for certain events  including  but not limited to  certain dividends on our parent company s common stock in excess of per share per quarter  per share per quarter  per share per quarter and per share per quarter  respectively 
therefore  the declaration and payment of quarterly dividends by our parent company in excess of these thresholds may increase the dilutive impact of our operating partnership s exchangeable debentures and our parent company s convertible preferred stock on our parent company s common stockholders 
while historically our parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders  it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property  including  in limited circumstances  our parent company s own shares 
as a result of this distribution 
table of contents requirement  our operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can 
our parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund our operating partnership s working capital needs  as well as potential developments at new or existing properties  acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures 
in addition  our parent company may be required to use borrowings under our operating partnership s revolving credit facility  if necessary  to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our parent company s reit status

we have concluded that the joint venture is a variable interest entity primarily due to the fact that we have participating voting rights through our common interest  but the common interest is not considered to be equity due to the fixed price put option 
the other member explicitly and implicitly bears of the common equity risk 
in addition  the other member  as the manager of the joint venture has more power than the operating partnership to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture s economic performance  and therefore was determined to be the primary beneficiary 
our maximum exposure to loss in the joint venture is our common and preferred investment totaling million and our share of the joint venture s debt of million 
upon our exercise of our put option  our exposure to loss will be limited to the remaining balance of our preferred interest in the joint venture 
we have accounted for our variable interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting and it is presented as an investment in unconsolidated joint venture in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
analysis of debt between fixed and variable rate we use interest rate swap and cap agreements and fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate movements

table of contents sensitivity to changes in interest rates the following table shows the effect if assumed changes in interest rates occurred assumed event interest rate change basis points change millions increase in fair value of interest rate swaps and caps following an assumed increase in interest rates decrease in fair value of interest rate swaps and caps following an assumed decrease in interest rates increase in annual interest expense on our debt that is variable rate and not subject to swapped or capped interest following a increase in interest rates decrease in annual interest expense on our debt that is variable rate and not subject to swapped or capped interest following a decrease in interest rates increase in fair value of fixed rate debt following a decrease in interest rates decrease in fair value of fixed rate debt following a increase in interest rates interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
foreign currency exchange risk for the years ended december  and  we had foreign operations in the united kingdom  ireland  france  the netherlands  switzerland  singapore and canada and  as such  are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies  which may affect future costs and cash flows 
our foreign operations are conducted in the british pound  euro  swiss franc and the singapore dollar  except for our canadian property for which the functional currency is the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are to the euro and the british pound 
we attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our properties in the local currency denominations  although there can be no assurance that this will be effective 
as a result  changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to us dollars may affect our revenues  operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders equity 
for the years ended december   and  operating revenues from properties outside the united states contributed million  million and million  respectively  which represented  and of our operating revenues  respectively
