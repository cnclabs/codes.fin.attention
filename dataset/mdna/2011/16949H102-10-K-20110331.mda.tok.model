overview our company formerly known as emazing interactive  inc was incorporated in the state of texas in april and re domiciled to become a nevada corporation in october from the date of our company s incorporation until june   when our company consummated the share exchange as defined below  our company s activities were primarily concentrated in web server access and company branding in hosting web based e games 
on june   our company entered into a share exchange agreement the exchange agreement  with i china net online media group limited  a company organized under the laws of british virgin islands china net bvi  ii china net bvi s shareholders  allglad limited  a british virgin islands company allglad  growgain limited  a british virgin islands company growgain  rise king investments limited  a british virgin islands company rise king bvi  star china holdings limited  a british virgin islands company star  surplus elegant investment limited  a british virgin islands company surplus  clear jolly holdings limited  a british virgin islands company clear and together with allglad  growgain  rise king bvi  star and surplus  the china net bvi shareholders  who together owned shares constituting of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of china net bvi the china net bvi shares and iii g 
edward hancock  our principal stockholder at such time 
pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement  the china net bvi shareholders transferred to us all of the china net bvi shares in exchange for the issuance of  shares the exchange shares in the aggregate of our common stock the share exchange 
as a result of the share exchange  china net bvi became our wholly owned subsidiary and we are now a holding company which  through certain contractual arrangements with operating companies in the people s republic of china the prc  is engaged in providing advertising  marketing and communication services to small and medium companies in china 
our wholly owned subsidiary  china net bvi  was incorporated in the british virgin islands on august  on april   china net bvi became the parent holding company of a group of companies comprised of cnet online technology limited  a hong kong company china net hk  which established and is the parent company of rise king century technology development beijing co  ltd  a wholly foreign owned enterprise wfoe established in the prc rise king wfoe 
we refer to the transactions that resulted in china net bvi becoming an indirect parent company of rise king wfoe as the offshore restructuring 
prc regulations prohibit direct foreign ownership of business entities providing internet content  or icp services in the prc  and restrict foreign ownership of business entities engaging in the advertising business 
in october  a series of contractual arrangements the contractual agreements were entered between rise king wfoe and business opportunity online beijing network technology co  ltd 
business opportunity online  beijing cnet online advertising co  ltd 
beijing cnet online collectively the prc operating subsidiaries and its common individual owners the prc shareholders or the control group 
the contractual agreements allowed china net bvi through rise king wfoe to  among other things  secure significant rights to influence the prc operating subsidiaries business operations  policies and management  approve all matters requiring shareholder approval  and the right to receive of the income earned by the prc operating subsidiaries 
in return  rise king wfoe provides consulting services to the prc operating subsidiaries 
in addition  to ensure that the prc operating subsidiaries and the prc shareholders perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements  the prc shareholders have pledged to rise king wfoe all of their equity interests in the prc operating subsidiaries 
they have also entered into an option agreement with rise king wfoe which provides that at such time that current restrictions under prc law on foreign ownership of chinese companies engaging in the internet content  information services or advertising business in china are lifted  rise king wfoe may exercise its option to purchase the equity interests in the prc operating subsidiaries directly 
at the time of the above contractual agreements were signed  the controlling shareholder of china net bvi is rise king bvi  who holds of the company s common stock 
the sole registered shareholder of rise king bvi  mr 
yang li  who owns  common stock of rising king bvi  entered into slow walk agreements with the control group individuals respectively  pursuant to which  upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  the control group individuals have the option to purchase up the  shares of rise king bvi   by mr 
handong cheng   by mr 
xuanfu liu and  by ms 
li sun  acting as a nominee for mr 
zhige zhang owned by mr 
yang li  at a purchase price of us per share the par value of rise king bvi s common stock 
under the terms of the slow walk agreement  the control group will have the right to purchase the shares as follows one third of the shares when china net bvi and its prc subsidiaries and affiliates the group will generate at least rmb  of the gross revenue for twelve months commencing from january  to december  the performance period i  one third of the shares when the group will generate at least rmb  of the gross revenue for six months commencing from january  to june  the performance period ii  one third of the shares when the group generates at least rmb  of the gross revenue for six months commencing from july  to december  the performance period iii 
in the event that the group does not achieve the performance targets specified above  then the control group individuals may exercise the option at the alternative exercise price which is us per share  on the date that the acquisition has been completed or abandoned 
each control group individual may purchase one third of the total number of shares that he or she is eligible to purchase under the slow walk agreement upon the satisfaction of each condition described above 
if the control group individuals purchase all shares eligible for purchase under the slow walk agreement  the control group will become the china net bvi s controlling shareholders 
the control group individuals also entered an entrustment agreement with rise king bvi collectively  pursuant to which  based on the equity interest held in the group directly or indirectly  rise king bvi entrusts the control group to manage the group companies by irrevocably authorizes the control group act on behalf of rise king bvi  as the exclusive agents and attorneys with respect to all matters concerning rise king bvi s shareholding  during the validity period of this agreement  including the rights of attending the shareholders meeting  exercising all the shareholder s rights and shareholder s voting rights enjoyed by rise king bvi under the laws and the articles of associations of the company and each group companies  collectively the group including without limitation voting for and making decisions on the increase or reduction of the authorized capital registered capital  issuing company bonds  merger  division  dissolution  liquidation of the group or change of group type  amendment to the articles of association of the group  designating and appointing the legal representatives the chairman of the board  directors  supervisors  general managers and other senior officers of the group 
the control group also agrees and confirms that each of them shall act in concert with one another when exercising all of their rights including but not limited to the voting rights authorized to them in this agreement 
the entrustment period commences on the execution date of this agreement and shall be effective within a period of years 
during the entrustment period  this agreement shall not be rescinded or terminated by any party unless unanimously agreed by all parties 
pursuant to the above contractual agreements  all of the equity owners rights and obligations of the prc operating subsidiaries were assigned to rise king wfoe  which resulted in the equity owners lacking the ability to make decisions that have a significant effect on the prc operating subsidiaries  and rise king wfoe ability to extract the profits from the operation of the prc operating subsidiaries  and assume the residual benefits of the prc operating subsidiaries 
because rise king wfoe and its indirect parent are the sole interest holders of the prc operating subsidiaries  and pursuant to the slow walk agreement and entrustment agreement between rise king bvi and the control group  the prc operating subsidiaries are under common control with the group  thus  china net bvi consolidates the prc operating subsidiaries from its inception  which is consistent with the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  subtopic as a result of the share exchange on june   the former china net bvi shareholders owned a majority of our common stock 
the transaction was regarded as a reverse acquisition whereby china net bvi was considered to be the accounting acquirer as its shareholders retained control of our company after the share exchange  although we are the legal parent company 
the share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of our company 
as such  china net bvi and its historical financial statements is the continuing entity for financial reporting purposes 
following the share exchange  we changed our name from emazing interactive  inc to chinanet online holdings  inc 
the financial statements have been prepared as if china net bvi had always been the reporting company and then on the share exchange date  had changed its name and reorganized its capital stock

basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and management estimates l change of reporting entity and basis of presentation as a result of the share exchange on june   the former china net bvi shareholders own a majority of our common stock 
the transaction was regarded as a reverse merger whereby china net bvi was considered to be the accounting acquirer as its shareholders retained control of our company after the share exchange  although we are the legal parent company 
the share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of our company 
as such  china net bvi and its historical financial statements is the continuing entity for financial reporting purposes 
pursuant to the terms of the share exchange  emazing interactive  inc was delivered with zero assets and zero liabilities at the time of closing 
following the share exchange  we changed our name from emazing interactive  inc to chinanet online holdings  inc our financial statements have been prepared as if china net bvi had always been the reporting company and then on the share exchange date  had changed its name and reorganized its capital stock 
l critical accounting policies and management estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and include the accounts of our company  and all of our subsidiaries 
we prepare financial statements in conformity with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information  our own historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
foreign currency translation our functional currency is united states dollars us  and the functional currency of china net hk is hong kong dollars hk 
the functional currency of our prc operating subsidiaries is renminbi rmb  and prc is the primary economic environment in which we operate 
for financial reporting purposes  the financial statements of our prc operating subsidiaries  which are prepared using the rmb  are translated into our reporting currency  the united states dollar us dollar 
assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period  and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
the resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
the exchange rates used to translate amounts in rmb into us for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows as of december  balance sheet items  except for equity accounts for the year ended december  items in the statements of income and comprehensive income  and statements cash flows no representation is made that the rmb amounts could have been  or could be converted into us at the above rates 
ownership interests in an investee company investee company that is not consolidated  but over which we exercise significant influence  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with asc topic equity method and joint ventures 
whether or not we exercise significant influence with respect to an investee depends on an evaluation of several factors including  among other things  representation on the investee company s board of directors and ownership level  which is generally a to interest in the voting securities of the investee company 
under the equity method of accounting  an investee company s accounts are not reflected within our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income and comprehensive income  however  our share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption share of earnings losses in equity investee company in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
our carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption ownership interests in investee company in our consolidated balance sheets 
when our carrying value in an equity method investee company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated financial statements unless we guaranteed obligations of the investee company or has committed additional funding 
when the investee company subsequently reports income  we will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously recognized 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with asc topic in accordance with asc topic  revenues are recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the service has been rendered  iii the fees are fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
sales include revenues from reselling of advertising time purchased from tv stations and internet advertising  reselling of internet advertising spaces and other advertisement related resources 
no revenue from advertising for advertising barter transactions was recognized because the transactions did not meet the criteria for recognition in asc topic  subtopic advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
pursuant to advertising contracts  we provide advertisement placements in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media and content integration 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and  as such  we consider the services to have been delivered 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
based upon our credit assessments of our customers prior to entering into contracts  we determine if collectability is reasonably assured 
in situations where collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash from customers  only after services have been provided and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
taxation income tax we adopt asc topic income taxes and use liability method to accounts for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between of the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income statement in the period that includes the enactment date 
we had no deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized for the year ended december  and we adopt asc topic through and  which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and income tax disclosures 
for the year ended december  and  we did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions

iv 
our prc operating entities  being incorporated in the prc  are governed by the income tax law of the prc and are subject to prc enterprise income tax eit 
effective from january   the eit rate of prc was changed from of to  and applies to both domestic and foreign invested enterprises 
l rise king wfoe is a software company qualified by the related prc governmental authorities and was entitled to a two year eit exemption from its first profitable year and a reduction of its applicable eit rate  which is of its taxable income for the exceeding three years 
rise king wfoe had a net loss for the year ended december  and its first profitable year is fiscal year which has been verified by the local tax bureau by accepting the application filed by us 
therefore  it was entitled to a two year eit exemption for fiscal year through fiscal year and a reduction of its applicable eit rate which is for fiscal year through fiscal year l business opportunity online was qualified as a high and new technology enterprise in beijing high tech zone in and was entitled to a three year eit exemption for fiscal year through fiscal year and a reduction of its applicable eit rate for the following three years for fiscal year through fiscal year however  in march  a new enterprise income tax law the new eit in the prc was enacted which was effective on january  subsequently  on april   relevant governmental regulatory authorities released new qualification criteria  application procedures and assessment processes for high and new technology enterprise status under the new eit which would entitle the re qualified and approved entities to a favorable statutory tax rate of 
with an effective date of september   business opportunity online obtained the approval of its reassessment of the qualification as a high and new technology enterprise under the new eit law and was entitled to a favorable statutory tax rate of 
under the previous eit laws and regulations  high and new technology enterprises enjoyed a favorable tax rate of and were exempted from income tax for three years beginning with their first year of operations  and were entitled to a tax reduction to for the subsequent three years and thereafter 
the current eit law provides grandfathering treatment for enterprises that were qualified as high and new technology enterprises under the previous eit laws  and established before march   if they continue to meet the criteria for high and new technology enterprises under the current eit law 
the grandfathering provision allows business opportunity online to continue enjoying their unexpired tax holidays provided by the previous eit laws and regulations 
therefore  its income tax was computed using a tax rate of for the year ended december  and due to its unexpired tax holidays 
l the applicable income tax rate for beijing cnet online was for the year ended december  and l the new eit also imposed a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside china  which were exempted under the previous enterprise income tax law and rules 
a lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland china and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company 
holding companies in hong kong  for example  will be subject to a rate

warrant liabilities on august  the closing date  we entered into a securities purchase agreement the purchase agreement  with several investors  including institutional  accredited and non us persons and entities the investors  pursuant to which we sold units  comprised of series a convertible preferred stock  par value us per share the series a preferred stock  and two series of warrants  for a purchase price of us per unit the august financing 
we sold  units in the aggregate  which included i  shares of series a preferred stock  ii series a warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of us per share with a three year term  and iii series a warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of us with a five year term 
net proceeds were approximately us  net of issuance costs of approximately us  tripoint global equities  llc acted as placement agent and received i a placement fee in the amount equal to of the gross proceeds and ii warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of us   shares at an exercise price of us and  shares at an exercise price of us respectively  with a five year term placement agent warrants and together with the series a warrants and series a warrants  the warrants 
the warrants have an initial exercise price which is subject to adjustments in certain circumstances for stock splits  combinations  dividends and distributions  reclassification  exchange or substitution  reorganization  merger  consolidation or sales of assets  issuance of additional shares of common stock or equivalents 
the warrants may not be exercised if it would result in the holder beneficially owning more than of our outstanding common shares 
that limitation may be waived by the holders of the warrants by sending a written notice to us not less than days prior to the date that they would like to waive the limitation 
accounting for warrants we analyzed the warrants in accordance with asc topic derivatives and hedging to determine whether the warrants meet the definition of a derivative under asc topic and if so  whether the warrants meet the scope exception of asc topic  which is that contracts issued or held by the reporting entity that are both indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholders equity shall not be considered to be derivative instruments for purposes of asc topic we adopted the provisions of asc topic subtopic  which applies to any freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative  as defined by asc topic and to any freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s own common stock 
as a result of adopting asc topic subtopic  we concluded that the warrants issued in the august financing should be treated as a derivative liability  because the warrants are entitled to a price adjustment provision to allow the exercise price to be reduced  in the event we issues or sells any additional shares of common stock at a price per share less than the then applicable exercise price or without consideration  which is typically referred to as a down round protection or anti dilution provision 
according to asc topic subtopic  the down round protection provision is not considered to be an input to the fair value of a fixed for fixed option on equity shares which leads the warrants fail to be qualified as indexed to our company s own stock and then to fail to meet the scope exceptions of asc topic therefore  we accounted for the warrants as derivative liabilities under asc topic pursuant to asc topic  derivatives should be measured at fair value and re measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings at each reporting period 
in accordance with asc topic subtopic section s  specific incremental costs directly attributable to a proposed or actual offering of securities may properly be deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the offering 
in accordance with the sec accounting and reporting manual cost of issuing equity securities are charged directly to equity as deduction of the fair value assigned to share issued 
accordingly  we concluded that the warrants issued to the placement agents are directly attributable to the august financing 
if we had not issued the warrants to the placement agent  we would have had to pay the same amount of cash as the fair value 
therefore  we deducted the total fair value of the placement agent warrants as of the commitment date which was approximately us  as a deduction of the fair value assigned to the series a preferred stock 
the total proceeds allocated to the series a warrants and series a warrants were approximately us  as of august  and the re measured fair value of these warrants as of december  was approximately us  the changes in fair value of the series a warrants and series a warrants which are approximately us  were recorded in earnings for the year ended december  since the placement agent warrants contain the same terms as the series a and series a warrants  the placement agent warrants are also entitled to the benefits of the down round protection provision  which means that the placement agent warrants will also need to be accounted for as a derivative under asc topic with changes in fair value recorded in earnings at each reporting period 
as of december   the total fair value of the placement agent warrants were approximately us  therefore  the changes of the total fair value of the placement agent warrants which were approximately us  were recorded in earnings for the year ended december  total amount of changes in fair value of warrants liabilities recorded in earnings was approximately us  for the year ended december  the following table summarizes the above transactions as of december  as of august  changes in fair value gain loss us us us fair value of the warrants series a warrant series a warrant placement agent warrants on march   we and the holders of the warrants entered into agreements to amend certain provisions of the warrants 
the amendment to the investor and placement agent warrants removes the down round protection rights that were applicable if we were to issue new shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants 
in addition  the amendment to the warrants added a provision to grant the holders of a majority of the warrants an approval right until december   over any new issuance of shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants 
as a result of this amendment  the warrants issued in the august financing were qualified as indexed to our company s own stock and then met the scope exceptions of asc topic  and were eligible to be reclassified as equity 
in accordance with asc topic  the classification of a contract should be reassessed at each balance sheet date 
if the classification required under this asc changes as a result of events during the period  the contract should be reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification 
if a contract is reclassified from an asset or a liability to equity  gains or losses recorded to account for the contract at fair value during the period that the contract was classified as an asset or a liability should not be reversed 
therefore  we re measured the fair value of the warrants as of march   the date of the event that caused the classification  which was approximately us  and reclassified the amount to equity as additional paid in capital 
the gain of the changes in fair value during the period that the warrants were classified as a derivative liability  which was approximately us  was recorded in earnings for the year ended december  the following table summarized the above transactions as of march  as of december  changes in fair value gain loss us us us fair value of the warrants series a warrant series a warrant placement agent warrants series a preferred stock the series a preferred stock has been classified as permanent equity as there was no redemption provision at the option of the holders that is not within the control of us on or after an agreed upon date 
we evaluated the embedded conversion feature in the series a preferred stock to determine if there was an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
we concluded that the embedded conversion feature of the series a preferred stock is not required to be bifurcated because the conversion feature is clearly and closely related to the host instrument 
allocation of the proceeds at commitment date and calculation of beneficial conversion feature the following table summarized the allocation of proceeds to the series a preferred stock and the warrants gross proceeds allocated number of instruments allocated value per instrument us us series a warrant series a warrant series a preferred stock total we then evaluated whether a beneficial conversion feature exists by comparing the operable conversion price of series a preferred stock with the fair value of the common stock at the commitment date 
we concluded that the fair value of common stock was greater than the operable conversion price of series a preferred stock at the commitment date and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature is greater than the proceeds allocated to the series a preferred stock 
in accordance with asc topic subtopic  if the intrinsic value of beneficial conversion feature is greater than the proceeds allocated to the series a preferred stock  the amount of the discount assigned to the beneficial conversion feature is limited to the amount of the proceeds allocated to the series a preferred stock 
accordingly  the total proceeds allocated to series a preferred stock were allocated to the beneficial conversion feature with a credit to additional paid in capital upon the issuance of the series a preferred stock 
since the series a preferred stock may convert to tour common stock at any time on or after the initial issue date  all discount was immediately recognized as a deemed dividend and a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders 
according to staff accounting bulletin topic a miscellaneous accounting expenses of offering asc topic subtopic section s  specific incremental costs directly attributable to a proposed or actual offering of securities may properly be deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the offering 
and in accordance with the sec accounting and reporting manual cost of issuing equity securities are charged directly to equity as deduction of the fair value assigned to share issued 
accordingly  we deducted the direct issuing cost paid in cash from the assigned fair value to the series a preferred stock

resources resell from unrelated parties from related parties bank kiosks from unrelated parties from related parties internet information management from unrelated parties from related parties total from unrelated parties from related parties total revenues our total revenues increased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the year ended december   representing a increase 
we derive the majority of our advertising service revenues from the sale of advertising space on our internet portal www 
com with the provision of related technical support  related internet marketing service and content management and from the sale of advertising time purchased from different tv programs to unrelated third parties and to certain related parties 
we report our advertising revenue between related and unrelated parties because historically about of our advertising service revenues came from clients related to certain shareholders of our prc operating subsidiaries 
our advertising services to related parties were provided in the ordinary course of business on the same terms as those provided to our unrelated advertising clients on an arm s length basis 
in the fiscal year of  we continued to execute our strategy of focusing on the internet advertising and marketing business and other related value added services  including search engine optimization and marketing  brand management  internet information management and others  which achieved gross margins of for the year ended december  we will continue to concentrate resources and capital on our advertising and marketing platform  mainly the internet portal  www 
com  and its related services in order to yield more predictable and recurring revenue 
our advertising service revenues are recorded net of any sales discounts  these discounts include volume discounts and other customary incentives offered to our small and medium franchise and merchant clients  including additional advertising time for their advertisements if we have unused places available on our website and represent the difference between our official list price and the amount we charge our clients 
we typically sign service contracts with our small and medium franchise and other small and medium enterprise clients that require us to place the advertisements on our portal website for specified places and specified periods  and or place the advertisements onto our purchased advisement time during specific tv programs for specified periods 
we recognize revenues as the advertisement airs over the contractual term based on the schedule agreed upon with our clients 
l we achieved a increase in internet advertising revenues to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period in this is primarily a result of the successful brand building effort that www 
com made in prior years both on tv and at other well known portal websites in china  as well as participating in government programs with respect to stimulating employment rates through entrepreneurship and launching of services to branded clients in china in the fiscal year of  more mature client service technologies  launching of more value added services as previously discussed  and a more experienced sales team 
we also enhanced our search engine optimization function  which allows us to provide a more technologically advanced chargeable advertisement for generating sales leads  which was also one of the main reasons for the increase in internet advertisement revenue 
during the year ended december   com has an annual weighted average of approximately active clients and the total revenue per month reached approximately million 
l we had a decrease in tv advertising revenue to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period in we generated this us million of tv advertising revenue by selling approximately  minutes of advertising time that we purchased from about seven provincial tv stations as compared with approximately  minutes of advertising time that we sold in the same period of the decrease in revenue we generated from the tv advertisement segment for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of last year were mainly due to the following reasons decrease of approximately  total minutes of tv advertising time sold in the year of as compared to that of year  increases in demand for tv advertising are relatively limited due to higher demand for internet advertising  which can be more cost effective  increase in tv minute cost which hardly passed to our customers and resulted in lower demand from our customers for this service  and the timing of the chinese spring festival  which is an important factor that affects the tv advertisement segment performance in the first quarter each year 
the tv advertisement business for franchisers in general begins after the chinese spring festival of each year 
in  the chinese spring festival ended later than pervious years  in the middle of the first quarter of as a result  the demand for our tv advertising services was affected for both january and february of in response to this decreased demand  we had to decrease our selling price which in turn led to negative gross margins in the first quarter of during the year  we reduced the business scope of the tv division  which was integrated into the advertising and marketing platform and provided to the existing internet client base as one of the additional communication channels 
the tv division is unlikely to expand internally in terms of its operational size and manpower  but it will continue to grow through external outsourcing and potential partnerships and or joint ventures to secure the availability of tv minutes when needed 
l our resale of internet advertising resources is our resale of a portion of the internet resources that we purchase from baidu in bulk to our existing internet advertising clients  in order to promote their businesses through sponsored searches  search engine traffic generation techniques and so forth 
we achieved approximately us million revenue in this business segment for the year ended december  as compared to approximately us million for the same period in we do not consider this segment to be a core business nor revenue source  because it does not promote the www 
com brand and the revenue generated by this segment is subjected to price fluctuation caused by the bidding system adopted by different search engines 
in the fiscal year of  as we intended to promote our direct service website of www 
com  which has a much higher gross profit  the revenue from this segment decreased as compared to last year 
we will continue to monitor our clients demands from this segment and negotiate the agency terms ie discount rate  credit terms  etc with major recourse providers  including baidu  and adjust our strategy accordingly 
l for the year ended december   we achieved approximately us million of revenue from bank kiosk business segment as compared to approximately us million for the same period in since the bank kiosk advertising business is still in the development stage  it was not a significant contribution to revenue for the year ended december  in may  we signed an exclusive agreement with shanghai rural commercial bank srcb to deploy our online banking and display advertising kiosks in all existing and all future srcb branches 
we also expanded the number of kiosks in fiscal year  we have placed orders to purchase and install an additional kiosks 
as of december   and we have finished the installation of an additional kiosks  including kiosks in china construction bank henan province and kiosks in srcb 
management believes that the increase in the number of the kiosks that have been and will be installed will enhance the related advertising coverage though bank kiosks and will help us to yield more clients in the future 
l internet information management is a new business segment that we launched in august  which offers our clients an artificial intelligence software product based on our proprietary search engine optimization technology 
the main objective of the product is to assist our clients to gain an early warning of potential negative exposure on the internet so that  when necessary  they can formulate an appropriate response 
we charge a monthly fee to clients using this service 
for the year ended december   we generated us million revenue from this business segment as compared to us million revenue generated for the same period of we plan to expand our efforts to offer this service to more of our existing clients as well as a part of our sales package to branded clients in the future 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consist of costs directly related to the offering of our advertising services 
the following table sets forth our cost of revenues  divided into five segments  by amount and gross profit ratio for the periods indicated  with inter segment transactions eliminated for the years ended december  amounts expressed in thousands of us dollars  except percentages revenue cost gp ratio revenue cost gp ratio internet advertisement tv advertisement internet ad 
resources resell bank kiosk internet information management others n a n a total cost of revenues our total cost of revenues decreased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period in this was mainly due to the decrease in costs associated with our lower margin business segments  such as the tv advertisement business and internet advertisement resources resale business 
the lower margins experienced by these business were relative to the decreases in revenues of these segments for the year ended december  our cost of revenues related to the offering of our advertising services primarily consists of internet resources purchased from other portal websites and technical services providers related to lead generation  sponsored search  tv advertisement time costs purchased from tv stations  and business taxes and surcharges 
l internet resources cost is the largest component of our cost of revenue for internet advertisement revenue 
we purchased these resources from other well known portal websites in china  such as baidu  google and tecent qq  to assist our internet advertisement clients to get more diversified exposure and to generate more visits to their advertisements  including  their mini sites  placed on our portal website 
we accomplish these objectives though sponsored search  advanced tracking  advanced traffic generating technologies  and search engine optimization technologies in connection with the well known portal websites indicated above 
for the years ended and  our internet resources cost for internet advertising revenue was us million and us million  respectively 
the increase of the internet resources cost was in line with the increase of the internet advertisement revenue 
according to our historical experiences  the average gross profit margin for internet advertising services was approximately 
for the year ended december  and  the gross profit margin for this segment was and respectively  which was considered stable and reasonable for this business segment 
l tv advertisement time cost is the largest component of our cost of revenue for tv advertisement revenue 
we purchase tv advertisement time from about seven different provincial tv stations and resell it to our tv advertisement clients 
our tv advertisement time cost was us million and us million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit margin for this segment decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period of this decrease was mainly due to the following reasons the increase of our selling price is relatively lower than the increase of the purchase cost per minute charged by the tv stations for the fiscal year of as the customers can hardly afford the increasing  as discussed above  due to the chinese spring festival celebrated in the middle of the first quarter of  we had to decrease our selling price further to eliminate the idle tv time purchased from the tv stations  which led to a negative gross profit margin of for this segment in the first quarter of this situation improved in the following quarters of  in which we achieved an average gross profit margin of approximately 
however  due to the increasing cost of the tv time  which led to a decrease in demand as compared to that of  the total revenue for the following quarters of decreased by approximately as compared with last year  therefore  the overall gross margin of this segment decreased significantly to 
during  we reduced the business scope of the tv division 
this division has been integrated into our advertising and marketing platform and provided to the existing internet client base as one of the additional communication channels 
it is unlikely to expand internally but will continue to grow through potential partnership externally 
l our resale of internet advertising resources consists of purchasing all of the ad related products from baidu in large volumes with a more favorable discount rate 
we make purchases of these internet resources to enhance the value added services offered to our internet advertising clients 
besides placing advertisements on www 
com  some of our advertising clients also seek to use other direct channels for their promotions 
certain of these clients purchase internet resources from us because  through us  they have access to lower rates as compared to the current market price for such internet resources 
the gross profit ratio for this business is not considered to be stable  because it is subjected to rates fluctuation triggered by the bidding system adopted by different search engines 
for the year ended december   we limited the supply of this segment  because we intend to promote the direct advertisement services to our customers through our own portal website  www 
com 
gross profit as a result of the foregoing  our gross profit was us million for the year ended december  compared to us million for the same period in along with the increase of the proportion of the high margin internet advertisement revenue over the total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  our overall gross margin increased to as compared with for the same period in operating expenses and net income our operating expenses consist of selling expenses  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the following tables set forth our operating expenses  divided into their major categories by amount and as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  amounts expressed in thousands of us dollars  except percentages amount of total revenue amount of total revenue total revenue gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses total operating expenses operating expenses our operating expenses increased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period of l selling expenses selling expenses decreased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period of our selling expenses primarily consist of advertising expenses for brand development that we pay to tv stations and other media outlets for the promotion and marketing of www 
com  other advertising and promotional expenses  staff salaries staff benefits  performance bonuses  website server hosting and broadband leasing expenses  and travel and communication expenses 
for the year ended december   the decrease in our selling expenses was mainly due to the decrease in our brand development advertising expenses on tv to approximately us million as compared to approximately us million for the same period in we do not expect that the decrease of brand building expenses on tv will have a significant adverse impact on our future revenue growth  because  through the investment we had made in brand building of www 
com in the last two years  our website has been gradually recognized as one of the most popular internet portal that provides internet advertising and marketing services and other value added services for smes  particularly for small and medium sized franchises  in china 
with the increasing cost of tv advertisements  we have changed our strategy of brand building activities to focus more on government supported programs to increase employment in order to bring our brand building potential and reputation to the next level 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately us million brand building expenses in relation to the co funding of entrepreneurship fund for chinese college students in china  which is recognized by the six major central ministries  including  china federation of industry and commerce  ministry of education  central committee of the communist young league  united front work department of cpc central committee  ministry of human resources and social security  and ministry of civil affairs 
management believes that these activities will help to yield additional branded clients who will utilize our portal to promote their chain stores or franchises  related products and services  or business opportunities over the internet and our other advertising channels 
without regard to the decrease of the brand development advertising expenses  the increase of the selling expenses for the year ended december  as compared to last year was mainly due to the increase of the staff salary and benefits expenses  which was approximately of us million 
l general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to us million for the year ended december  as compared to us million for the same period in our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for management  accounting and administrative personnel  office rentals  depreciation of office equipment  professional service fees  maintenance  utilities and other office expenses 
the increase in our general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the following reasons the increase in professional services charges related to being a us public company  including but not limited to legal  accounting  internal control enhancement etc  for approximately of us million  the increase of the start up expenditures of our newly established subsidiary  shenzhen mingshan  for approximately of us million  and the increase of staff salary  travelling expenses and other general office supplies in relation to the expansion of our business  for about us million 
l research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period of our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for the research and development staff  equipment depreciation expenses  and office utilities and supplies allocated to our research and development department 
the increase of the research and development expenses for the year ended december  was mainly due to the expansion of our r d function which resulted in an increase of the salary expenses and other general administrative expense and suppliers 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we continue to expand  optimize and enhance the technology of our portal website  upgrade our advertising and internet management software and develop other related cloud based management tools 
in the next three to five years  we expect research and development expenses to be within the range of four percent to six percent of our total revenues 
operating profit as a result of the foregoing  our operating profit increased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period of changes in fair value of warrants we originally accounted for our warrants issued to investors and placement agent in our august financing as derivative liabilities under asc topic derivatives and hedging  because it contains a down round protection that were applicable if we were to issue new shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants 
the down round protection provision is not considered to be an input to the fair value of a fixed for fixed option on equity shares which lead to the warrants to fail to be qualified as indexed to the company s own stock and then fail to meet the scope exceptions of asc topic therefore  we accounted for the warrants as derivative liabilities under asc topic pursuant to asc topic  derivative should be measured at fair value and re measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings at each reporting period 
therefore  we recorded approximately us million loss of the changes in fair value of warrants for the year ended december  on march   we and the holders of the warrants entered into agreements to amend certain provisions of the warrants 
the amendment to the investor and placement agent warrants removes the down round protection rights 
in addition  the amendment to the warrants added a provision to grant the holders of a majority of the warrants an approval right until december   over any new issuance of shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants 
as a result of this amendment  the warrants issued in the august financing were qualified as indexed to our own stock and then met the scope exceptions of asc topic  and were eligible to be reclassified as equity 
in accordance with asc topic  the classification of a contract should be reassessed at each balance sheet date 
if the classification required under this asc changes as a result of events during the period  the contract should be reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification 
if a contract is reclassified from an asset or a liability to equity  gains or losses recorded to account for the contract at fair value during the period that the contract was classified as an asset or a liability should not be reversed 
therefore  we re measured the fair value of the warrants as of march   the date of the event that caused the classification  which was approximately us  and reclassified the amount to equity as additional paid in capital 
the gain of the changes in fair value during the period that the warrants were classified as a derivative liability for the year ended december   which was approximately us  was recorded in earnings 
income tax we recognized an income tax expense of us million and us million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
with an effective date of september   one of our prc operating entity  business opportunity online obtained the approval of its reassessment of the qualification as a high and new technology enterprise under the new eit law and was entitled to a favorable statutory tax rate of 
under the previous eit laws and regulations  high and new technology enterprises enjoyed a favorable tax rate of and were exempted from income tax for three years beginning with their first year of operations  and were entitled to a tax reduction to for the following three years and thereafter 
the current eit law provides grandfathering treatment for enterprises that were qualified as high and new technology enterprises under the previous eit laws  and established before march   if they continue to meet the criteria for high and new technology enterprises under the current eit law 
the grandfathering provision allows business opportunity online to continue enjoying their unexpired tax holidays provided by the previous eit laws and regulations 
business opportunity online was eligible to enjoy the grandfathering treatment  because it was established before march  and was qualified as a high and new technology enterprise under the previous eit laws  which was granted with a three year eit exemption from fiscal year through and an eit deduction to from fiscal year through fiscal year therefore  its income tax was computed using a tax rate of for the year ended december  and due to its unexpired tax holidays 
the applicable income tax rate for beijing cnet online was for the year ended december  and rise king wfoe was granted a two year eit exemption for fiscal year its first profitable year through fiscal year and a reduction of its applicable eit rate which is for fiscal year through fiscal year therefore  no income tax expense was accrued for rise king wfoe for the year ended december  and net income as a result of the foregoing  our net income amounted to us million for the year ended december  as compared to us million for the same period of excluding the non cash gain of us million and non cash loss of us million recorded as changes in fair value of warrants for the year ended december  and  respectively  we achieved net income amounting to us million and us million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
loss attributable to noncontrolling interest our newly established consolidated majority owned subsidiary shenzhen mingshan was still in the start up period as of december  the net loss incurred for the year ended december  of shenzhen mingshan was allocated between the shareholders of shenzhen mingshan based on ownership percentage in the entity 
based on the ownership percentages of shenzhen mingshan  we allocated approximately us million of losses to the noncontrolling interest shareholders of shenzhen mingshan for the year ended december  net income attributable to chinanet online holdings  inc total net income we achieved for the year ended december  minus the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest shareholders as discussed above was the net income attributable to chinanet online holdings  inc beneficial conversion feature of series a convertible preferred stock upon consummation of our august financing  we evaluated whether a beneficial conversion feature exists by comparing the operable conversion price of series a preferred stock with the fair value of the common stock at the commitment date 
we concluded that the fair value of common stock was greater than the operable conversion price of series a preferred stock at the commitment date and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature is greater than the proceeds allocated to the series a preferred stock 
in accordance with asc topic subtopic  if the intrinsic value of beneficial conversion feature is greater than the proceeds allocated to the series a preferred stock  the amount of the discount assigned to the beneficial conversion feature is limited to the amount of the proceeds allocated to the series a preferred stock  which was approximately us  accordingly  the approximately us  proceeds allocated to series a preferred stock were all allocated to the beneficial conversion feature with a credit to additional paid in capital upon the issuance of the series a preferred stock 
since the series a preferred stock may convert to our common stock at any time on or after the initial issuing date  all beneficial conversion feature should be immediately recognized as a deemed dividend  a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders 
therefore  we recorded approximately us  beneficial conversion feature of series a convertible preferred stock for the year ended december   as deemed dividend  a deduction of net income attributable to common shareholders of chinanet online holdings  inc dividend for series a convertible preferred stock cash dividend to series a convertible stock holders was calculated at the per annum rate of of the liquidation preference amount of the series a preferred stock which was us per share and the actual number of days each share outstanding within the reporting period 
the cash dividend we accrued for the series a convertible preferred stock was approximately us million and us million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
net income attributable to chinanet s common shareholders net income attributable to chinanet s common shareholders represents the net income after the allocation to the noncontrolling interest shareholders minus the beneficial conversion feature of series a convertible preferred stock  as deemed dividend to the holders of the preferred stock and the cash dividend accrued for series a convertible preferred stock
