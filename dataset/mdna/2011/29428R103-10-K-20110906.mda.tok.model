our investment process is centered on the integration of several components fundamental research analysis  quantitative research  disciplined portfolio construction and management  performance attribution and trading 
our investment process incorporates the following concepts analyze the business 
determine the sustainability of the business  earnings drivers  barriers to entry  and competitive advantages 
understand the cash flow structure 
focus on companies that generate cash earnings and assess the quality and character of those earnings to determine the net cash flow from the business 
relate cash flow to enterprise value 
examine relevant claims against net cash flow and determine the necessity of these claims to maintain and grow the business 
evaluate how management will use free cash flow 
value the cash flow stream and compare it to enterprise value to determine the attractiveness of the investment 
evaluate management quality 
identify management with an intention and demonstrated ability to create shareholder value 
seek unrecognized assets 
uncover  where possible  hidden  undervalued or underutilized assets  especially in under researched small and mid cap companies

table of contents investment strategy development we have developed several new investment strategies since our inception 
investment strategy development has stemmed from our investment team s skill and market knowledge  as well as our responsiveness to client and market demands 
we will only launch a new investment strategy if we believe that it can add value to a client s investment portfolio  or may be attractive to our clients in the future

distribution channels our aum is distributed through multiple channels 
our institutional sales efforts include building strong relationships with institutional consultants and also establishing direct relationships with institutional clients 
we manage certain sub advisory mandates that provide access to market segments that we would not otherwise serve 
for example  we currently serve as sub advisor to mutual funds offered by major financial institutions in retail channels 
these mandates are attractive to us because we have chosen not to build the large team of sales professionals typically required to service those channels 
we typically approach the servicing of those relationships in a manner similar to our approach with other large institutional account clients 
we service the high net worth channel both directly and through third party intermediaries  such as wealth advisers who utilize our investment strategies in investment programs they construct for their clients 
we maintain a limited direct sales effort in the high net worth channel  and previously raised the minimum account size for this channel 
the following table provides information regarding the composition of our aum by distribution channel for the past five years  as well as its respective compound annual growth rate for the one  three  and five years ended june  in millions as of june compound annual growth rate distribution channel year years years sub advisory institutional high net worth total aum during the three months ended december   approximately million of aum previously classified as institutional was reclassified to sub advisory in conjunction with the adoption of the epoch funds by new york life investment management 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately million of aum in separate accounts within the high net worth distribution channel transferred to the epoch global absolute return fund  llc  and approximately million transferred to the epoch us all cap equity fund  both of which are included within the institutional distribution channel above 
strategic relationship in july  we entered into a strategic relationship with new york life investments  whereby the mainstay group of funds adopted our family of mutual funds the epoch funds 
the adoption was completed in november we are responsible for the day to day investment management of the funds through a sub advisory relationship  while mainstay investments mainstay  the retail distribution arm of new york life investments  is responsible for the distribution and administration of the funds 
each former epoch fund is now co branded as a mainstay epoch fund 
in addition to an existing sub advisory relationship with new york life investments for certain funds  and the adoption of the epoch funds indicated above  eip and new york life investments have entered into an arrangement wherein  among other things  eip and an affiliate of new york life investments have established a distribution and administration relationship with respect to certain separately managed account and unified managed account products  and for a period of three years new york life investments agrees to pay certain additional base fees and meet minimum distribution targets 
for the fiscal year ended june   new york life investment management  through the mainstay epoch funds and other funds sub advised by eip  accounted for approximately of consolidated operating revenues 
our services and relationship with new york life investment management is considered important to our ongoing growth strategy

competition the investment advisory and investment management industry is highly competitive 
there are few barriers to entry for new firms and consolidation within the industry continues to alter the competitive landscape 
we continuously encounter competitors in the marketplace who offer similar investment strategies and services 
no single or small group of competitors is dominant in the industry 
we compete in the us and international markets with a large number of global and us investment advisors  commercial banks  broker dealers  insurance companies and other financial institutions 
according to pensions investments  a publication covering the money management industry  we ranked th worldwide out of asset management firms as of december   based on our aum level of billion at that time 
when comparing only the equity portion of aum of all asset management firms  we ranked th out of firms who had all or a portion of their aum invested in equities 
we compete primarily on the basis of investment philosophy  investment performance  range of investment strategies and features  reputation  and quality of client service 
we believe that our investment style  investment strategies  and distribution channels enable us to compete effectively in our industry 
we also believe that being an independent asset management firm is a competitive advantage  enabling our business model to avoid conflicts that are often inherent within larger institutions that offer a wide range of services 
while we believe we will continue to be successful in growing our aum  it may be necessary to expend additional resources to compete effectively 
our competitive success will depend upon our ability to develop and market investment strategies  adopt or develop new technologies  and continue to expand our relationships with existing clients and attract new ones 
our ability to compete also depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees while managing our compensation and other costs

as a matter of public policy  regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of participants in those markets  including investment advisory clients and shareholders of investment funds 
under these laws and regulations  agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers  including the power to limit  restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event the adviser fails to comply with such laws and regulations 
possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability  the suspension of individual employees  limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time  revocation of investment adviser and other registrations  censures and fines

requirements relate to  among other things  fiduciary duties to clients  engaging in transactions with clients  disclosure obligations  record keeping and reporting obligations  and general anti fraud prohibitions 
moreover  in our capacity as a sub advisor to mutual funds  we are subject to the investment company act of the investment company act and its rules and regulations

under the investment advisers act  our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client s consent 
under the investment company act  advisory agreements with registered funds  such as the funds we subadvise  terminate automatically upon assignment 
the term assignment is broadly defined and includes direct assignment as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur  under certain circumstances  upon the transfer  directly or indirectly  of a controlling interest in us 
the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the investment advisers act and the investment company act  ranging from fines and censures to termination of an investment adviser s registration

the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented 
the ultimate adoption of these regulations and decisions will determine the impact of the dfa on us 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate effects that the dfa  or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions  will have upon our business and results of operations

we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism  excellence  diversity  cooperation among our employees  and high standards of business ethics 
as of june   we employed full time employees  including investment management  research and trading professionals  marketing and client service professionals and operations and business management professionals 
none of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements 
our portfolio managers and analysts average over years of experience 
since our founding seven years ago  we have had a very low turnover rate among our portfolio managers and analysts

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
as an investment management firm  risk is an inherent part of our business 
capital markets  by their nature  are prone to uncertainty and expose participants to a variety of risks 
while we devote significant resources across all of our operations to identify  measure  monitor  manage and analyze market and operating risk  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  or share price could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 
additionally  other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future 
risks related to our business difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including reducing the value of our aum and or causing clients to withdraw funds  each of which could materially reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
we derive all of our revenues from investment management services 
the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum 
accordingly  a general or prolonged decline in securities markets  and equity markets in particular  may cause our revenues and net income to decline due to i the value of our aum decreasing  and or ii clients withdrawing funds in favor of investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk 
the securities markets have recently been and may continue to be highly volatile and securities prices may decrease for many reasons beyond our control  including a general economic downturn  deterioration in the credit of sovereign nations  political uncertainty or acts of terrorism 
in addition  any such decline in the equity markets  failure of these markets to sustain their prior levels of growth  or continued short term volatility in these markets could result in clients withdrawing funds from our investment strategies in full or in part  or decreased demand for our investment services  which would adversely affect us 
our operating margin may also be adversely affected if we are unable to reduce fixed costs and other expenses within a time frame sufficient to match any decrease in revenue relating to changes in our aum 
our investment style in the asset management business may underperform other investment approaches  which may result in significant client or asset departures or a reduction in aum 
even when securities prices are rising  performance can be affected by investment style 
many of the equity investment strategies in our asset management business share a common investment orientation towards fundamental security selection 
our overall investment philosophy is focused on achieving a superior risk adjusted return by investing in companies that generate free cash flow 
we believe this style tends to outperform the market in some market environments and underperform it in others 
in particular  a prolonged growth environment ie  a prolonged period whereby growth stocks outperform value stocks may cause our investment strategy to be out of favor with some clients  consultants or third party intermediaries 
if our investment strategies perform poorly  our results of operations  financial condition and our prospects for future growth may be materially adversely affected 
the relative performance of our investment strategies is critical in retaining existing clients as well as attracting new clients 
if our investment strategies perform poorly  our earnings could be reduced because existing clients may withdraw funds from our asset management business in favor of better performing investment strategies  which could cause the revenues that we generate from our investment advisory fees to decline  third party financial intermediaries  advisers or consultants may rate our investment strategies poorly  which may result in client withdrawals and reduced asset flows from these third parties or their clients  the investment funds which we sub advise may decide not to renew or decide to terminate the agreements pursuant to which we sub advise them and we may not be able to replace these relationships  or firms with which we have strategic alliances may terminate such relationships with us  and future strategic alliances may be unavailable 

table of contents because our clients can remove the assets we manage on short notice  we may experience unexpected declines in revenue and profitability 
our investment advisory and sub advisory agreements can generally be terminated upon very short notice 
institutional and individual clients  and firms with which we have strategic alliances  can terminate their relationships with us  reduce the aggregate amount of aum or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  changes in investment preferences  changes in their management or control  loss of our key investment management or other personnel  and financial market performance 
further  the ability to terminate relationships may allow clients to renegotiate for lower fees paid for asset management services 
the decrease in revenues that results from any such significant terminations  withdrawals or reductions in fees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  in the us  as required by the investment company act  each of our investment advisory agreements with the mutual funds we advise or sub advise automatically terminates upon its assignment  or transfer of our responsibility for fund management 
each of our other investment advisory agreements subject to the provisions of the investment advisers act provides that the agreement may not be assigned without the consent of the client 
a sale of a sufficiently large block of shares of our voting securities or other transactions could be deemed an assignment in certain circumstances 
an assignment  actual or constructive  will trigger these termination provisions and could adversely affect our ability to continue managing these client accounts 
to the extent that a technical assignment of investment advisory agreements arises  we will take the necessary steps to provide clients an opportunity to consent to the continuation of their advisory agreements 
such new agreements may need approval by the stockholders of the respective funds 
in the event that any of these clients do not consent to a renewal of their agreement  our revenue and profitability may be materially adversely impacted 
our business and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted by the highly variable nature of our revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  because of market fluctuations  there may not be a consistent pattern in our financial results from period to period 
because our revenues are based on the value of our aum  fluctuations in the equity markets and our aum affect our revenues 
a reduction in the equity markets generally has a negative impact on the level of our aum and consequently our revenues 
additionally  asset flows  whether inflows or outflows  can be highly variable from month to month and quarter to quarter 
accordingly  our revenues  results of operations and cash flows are all highly variable 
we may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors  including changes in our operating expenses and unexpected business developments and initiatives 
such variability and unpredictability may lead to volatility or declines in the price of our common stock and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period or particularly meaningful as a basis of comparison against results for a prior period 
access to clients through intermediaries is important to our asset management business  and reductions in referrals from such intermediaries or poor reviews of our investment strategies or our organization by such intermediaries could materially reduce our revenue and impair our ability to attract new clients 
our ability to grow our business relies  in large part  on receiving mandates from the client base of investment consultants  insurance companies  defined contribution plan administrators  international and regional securities firms  mutual fund providers  third party distributors and other intermediaries 
these intermediaries review and evaluate our investment strategies and our organization 
poor reviews or evaluations of either the particular investment strategies or of our organization may result in client withdrawals or an inability to attract new assets through such intermediaries 
the inability to have this access could materially adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continued services of our key personnel  and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend upon the skills  expertise and continued contributions of our key personnel and our management team 
the loss of any such personnel  without adequate replacement  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
loss of key personnel may occur due to perceived opportunity for promotion  increased compensation  work environment or other individual reasons  some of which may be beyond our control 

table of contents except for our ceo  there are no employment agreements with any other key employees 
the loss of services of one or more key employees  or failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and may prevent us from sustaining the performance of our investment strategies or adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 
we do not carry any key man insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any key members of senior management  our investment team  or senior marketing personnel 
the market for experienced asset management professionals is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by the movement of employees among different firms 
compensation levels in the investment management industry are highly competitive and can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
due to the competitive market for asset management professionals and the success achieved by some of our key personnel  the costs to retain key personnel are significant and will likely increase over time 
we also anticipate that it will be necessary for us to hire additional key personnel as we further develop our business 
consequently  in our efforts to attract and retain highly skilled individuals  our compensation expense could increase at a level that could adversely affect our profitability 
additionally  we utilize share based awards as part of our compensation program and as a means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent 
a decline in our share price could lessen the effectiveness of retaining employees through share based awards 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 
if our techniques for managing risk are ineffective  we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses 
to manage the significant risks inherent in our business  we must maintain effective policies  procedures and systems that enable us to identify  assess and manage the full spectrum of our risks including market  fiduciary  operational  legal  regulatory and reputational risks 
while we believe that our approach to risk management helps us to manage the risks in our business  our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design or implementation  or as a result of the lack of adequate  accurate or timely information or otherwise 
if our risk management efforts are ineffective  we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  we could be subject to litigation and sanctions or fines from regulators 
our techniques for managing risks in client portfolios may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market environments  or against all types of risk  including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate 
any failures in our risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in those portfolios or to achieve positive  risk adjusted returns 
in addition  any risk management failures could cause portfolio losses to be significantly greater than historical measures predict 
if approaches to managing those risks prove insufficient  it may expose us to material unanticipated losses in the value of client portfolios  a reduction in our revenues  and a material adverse impact on our business 
our reputation is critical to our success 
as a financial services firm  we depend on our reputation of integrity and high caliber professional services 
any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel  and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum 
in recent years  there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud  conflicts of interest or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry  and there is the risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business 
for example  if an employee were to engage or be accused of engaging in illegal or suspicious activities such as improper trading  disclosure of confidential information or breach of fiduciary duties  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm 
we are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the assets we manage as well as our status as a public company listed on the nasdaq global select market 
accordingly  we have adopted and implemented a code of ethics and other related policies and procedures to address such obligations and standards 
however  it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases 
misconduct by our employees  or even unsubstantiated allegations  could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business 

table of contents failure to comply with client requirements and or guidelines could result in losses  damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 
the investment management agreements under which we provide investment advisory services specify certain guidelines or requirements that we are required to observe in the provision of our services 
while we maintain various compliance procedures and controls to monitor such guidelines and prevent related errors  a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in losses to a client or investors in a fund which  depending on the circumstances  could result in our making clients or fund investors whole for such losses 
if we believed that the circumstances did not justify a reimbursement  or clients and investors believed the reimbursement offered was insufficient  they could seek to recover damages from us or could withdraw assets from our management or terminate the investment management agreement 
any of these events could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could lower our net income or negatively impact the portfolios of our clients and may affect the levels of our aum 
certain client portfolios include securities denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations may affect the levels of our aum 
for securities denominated in currencies other than us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to those non us currencies may result in a decrease in the dollar value of our aum  which  in turn  would result in lower us dollar denominated revenues 
additionally  a limited portion of our clients are billed for management and performance fees in currencies other than us dollars  and the amounts due to us are subject to foreign currency fluctuation 
if the currency in which our fees are paid depreciates against the us dollar  our net income could decline 
while these risks could be limited by foreign currency hedging  some risks cannot be hedged and there is no guarantee that our hedging activity would be successful 
additionally  hedging would result in additional costs to us 
the significant growth we have experienced in recent years may not be indicative of future growth 
our aum increased from approximately billion at june  to approximately billion at june   and it represents a significant rate of growth that may be difficult to sustain 
the growth of our business depends on  among other things  our success in producing attractive returns in our investment strategies  our ability to expand our distribution capabilities  the overall performance of the equity markets  and our ability to deal with changing market conditions 
our continued growth places significant demands on our legal  compliance  accounting  risk management  administrative and operational resources 
rapid growth in our aum imposes substantial demands on our legal  compliance  accounting  risk management  administrative and operational infrastructures 
we must maintain adequate infrastructure  including technological capacity  backup facilities and sufficient space for expanding staff levels 
furthermore  our future growth will depend on  among other things  our ability to maintain highly reliable operating platforms  management systems and financial reporting and compliance infrastructures that are also sufficiently flexible to promptly and appropriately address our business needs  applicable legal and regulatory requirements and relevant market and operating conditions  all of which change rapidly 
addressing these matters may require us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources  even during periods when we are experiencing declines in aum 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our operations efficiently without incurring substantial additional expense or that we will be able to effectively grow our business and aum  and any failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents we derive more than of our operating revenue from one client 
pursuant to a strategic relationship with new york life investment management  eip is the sub advisor to several mutual funds within new york life investment management s mainstay group of funds 
as such  new york life investment management accounted for approximately of revenues for fy there can be no assurance that our relationship with new york life will remain in place 
a loss of this client would significantly impact our operating revenues and net income  and we may not be able to establish relationships with other clients in order to replace the lost revenues and net income 
changes in fee levels or asset mix could reduce revenues and margins 
our profit margins and net income are dependent  in significant part  on our ability to maintain current fee levels for the investment strategies that we offer 
in recent years  however  in response to market pressures  there has been a trend towards lower fees in the asset management industry and no assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure 
although our investment management fees vary from investment strategy to investment strategy  we compete primarily on the basis of our investment performance and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors 
in order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment  we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and client service that incentivize our clients to pay our fees 
we cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure 
additionally  a shift in the mix in our aum from higher revenue generating aum to lower revenue generating aum may result in a decrease in revenues even if our aggregate level of aum remains unchanged or increases 
our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses  which is subject to fluctuation 
our expenses are subject to fluctuation and may increase for various reasons  including variations in compensation due to changes in employee staffing levels  mix  or incentive compensation  expenses incurred to support the distribution of our investment strategies  and changes in expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure 
we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to match a significant deterioration in revenues 
if we are unable to implement appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues  or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace  our profitability  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we may enter into more performance based fee arrangements with our clients in the future  which could cause greater fluctuations in our revenues 
a small portion of our investment advisory revenues is currently derived from performance fees 
we earn performance fees under certain client agreements if the investment performance in the portfolio meets or exceeds a specified benchmark 
in these instances  we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time 
in addition  some performance based fee arrangements include a high watermark provision  which generally provide that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark  it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance based fees 
therefore  if we fail to achieve the performance target for a particular period  we will not earn a performance fee for that period and  for accounts with a high watermark provision  our ability to earn future performance fees may be impaired 
we earned million  million  and million in performance fees during fiscal years   and  respectively 
performance fees may become more common in our industry 
an increase in performance fees  or in performance based fee arrangements with clients  could create greater fluctuations in our revenues 

table of contents expansion into international markets may increase operational  regulatory and other risks 
we offer investment management services in many different regulatory jurisdictions globally and intend to continue to expand our operations 
as we increase our international business activities and expand our investment strategy offerings  we will face increased operational  regulatory  compliance  reputational and other risks 
additionally  we will likely incur additional costs and expenses 
a failure of our compliance and internal control systems to properly mitigate such risks  or of our operating infrastructure to support such international expansion  could result in a loss of clients or inability to attract new clients  regulatory fines or sanctions  damage to our reputation  or other material adverse impacts on our business 
we are subject to numerous operational risks which may disrupt our business  result in regulatory action against us  or limit our growth 
we face numerous operational risks related to our business on a day to day basis 
among other things  we must be able to consistently and reliably obtain securities pricing information  process investment transactions and provide reports and other customer service to our clients 
any failure to keep current and accurate books and records can render us liable to disciplinary action by governmental and self regulatory authorities  as well as to claims by our clients 
if any of our financial  portfolio accounting or other data processing systems  or the systems of third parties on whom we rely for information or communication  do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  or those of third parties on whom we rely  we could suffer a financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory problems or damage to our reputation 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  it potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to spend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against fully or not fully covered through any insurance that we maintain 
lastly  we depend on our headquarters  which is located in new york city  for the continued operation of our business 
a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our headquarters  or an event disrupting the ability of our employees to perform their job functions there  including terrorist attacks or a disruption involving electrical communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business  directly affecting our headquarters  may have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption 
although we have disaster recovery programs in place  there can be no assurance that these will be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption 
in addition  insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses 
insurance coverage may not protect us from all of the liabilities that could arise from the risks inherent in our business 
we maintain insurance coverage focused on reducing risks related to our operations  in amounts that we consider appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  that a claim or claims will be completely covered by insurance or  if covered  will not exceed the limits of our existing insurance coverage 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  we could be exposed to substantial liability 
insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and may increase significantly over relatively short periods 
renewals of insurance policies may result in additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co insurance liability 

table of contents various factors may prevent the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
to date  we have paid a quarterly cash dividend each quarter since the quarter ended december  and have paid three special dividends 
however  the payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors  and various events or factors may prevent us from paying dividends 
our board of directors will take into account factors such as general economic and business conditions  our financial condition and results of operations  our strategic plans and prospects  working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs  and any legal  contractual or regulatory restrictions 
we may pursue strategic transactions that could create risks  present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs  and could dilute the stock ownership of our stockholders 
as part of our long term business strategy  we routinely assess our strategic position  and from time to time address potential transactions  including acquisitions  joint ventures or other transactions aimed at expanding the geography and scope of our operations  and further enhancing our competitive position 
we expect to explore partnership opportunities that we believe to be accretive 
any such strategic transactions involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  difficulty with integrating personnel and operating infrastructure  and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
our clients may react unfavorably to any such strategic transaction  we may not realize anticipated benefits  and may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture  any of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
in addition  strategic transactions may involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock  which would dilute our existing ownership 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile  which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur  which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock 
some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include withdrawals by clients of their assets  poor investment performance  unanticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations  a reduction or termination of the regular dividend  failure to meet analysts earnings estimates  publication of negative research or press reports about us  or our investments or the investment management industry  departures of key investment or management personnel  changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations  or announcements relating to these matters  fluctuations in the performance or share price of other investment management companies  adverse publicity about the asset management industry generally or scandals specifically  sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur  and difficult global market and economic conditions 
our officers and directors own a substantial amount of our common stock and therefore exercise significant control over our corporate governance and affairs 
our executive officers and directors control approximately of our outstanding common stock including exercisable stock options held by them 
these shareholders  if they act together  may be able to exercise substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring approval of our shareholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our ability to issue blank check preferred stock without approval by the holders of our common stock could adversely affect the rights of common shareholders and could be used as an anti takeover device 
our charter allows our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine its rights  powers  and preferences without shareholder approval blank check preferred stock 
future preferred stock issued under the board s authority could contain preferences over our common stock as to dividends  distributions  and voting power 
holders of preferred stock could  for example  be given the right to separately elect some number of our directors in all or specified events or an independent veto right over certain transactions  and redemption rights and liquidation preferences assigned to preferred shareholders could affect the residual value of common stock 
we could also use the preferred stock to deter or delay a change in control that may be opposed by management 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock 
section of the sarbanes oxley act and the related rules require our management to conduct an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and require a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to and reporting on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as well as an independent audit of our financial statements 
if we fail for any reason to comply with the requirements of section  our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
matters negatively affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis  or may cause us to restate previously issued financial statements  and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences  including sanctions by the sec or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules 
there could also be a decline in the price of our common stock due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements 
certain changes in accounting and or financial reporting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec or other standard setting bodies could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
as such  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting and or financial reporting standards issued by recognized accounting standard setters or regulators  such as fasb and the sec 
it is possible that future requirements  including the recently proposed implementation of international financial reporting standards ifrs  could change our current application of gaap  resulting in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risks related to our industry we face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies  many of whom have greater resources and the ability to offer clients a wider range of investment strategies and services than we can offer 
we compete with numerous investment management firms  mutual fund companies  commercial banks  investment banks  hedge funds  insurance companies and other financial institutions 
some of these institutions have greater capital  marketing and other resources  and offer more strategies and services than we do 
our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the strategies and services we offer 
if these competitors are successful  we may lose clients or fail to attract new clients and our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms  and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels globally have also resulted in increased competition 
in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation  both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment strategies 
further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future 
the increasing size and market influence of certain competitors may have a negative impact on our prospects for growth and our profit margins in the future 

table of contents extensive regulation of our business limits our activities and results in ongoing exposure to the potential for significant penalties  including fines or limitations on our ability to conduct our business 
the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation 
we are subject to regulation by governmental and self regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world 
many of these regulators  including us and us government agencies and self regulatory organizations  as well as state securities commissions in the us  are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure  fine  the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of an investment adviser 
the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect clients and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect our stockholders 
consequently  these regulations often limit our activities 
we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities  including extended investigation and surveillance activity  adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to modifications and further regulation 
new laws  regulations  or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our company and our clients may also adversely affect our business  and our ability to function in this environment will depend on our ability to constantly monitor and react to these changes 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which our clients operate may impact our business 
for example  changes in antitrust laws or the enforcement of antitrust laws could affect the level of mergers and acquisitions activity and changes in state laws may limit investment activities of state pension plans 
instances of criminal activity and fraud by participants in the asset management industry  disclosures of trading and other abuses by participants in the financial services industry  and the recent massive governmental intervention and investment in the financial markets and financial firms have lead the us government and regulators to increase the rules and regulations governing  and oversight of  the us financial system 
the cumulative effect of these actions may result in increased expenses  or lower management fees  and therefore  adversely affect the revenues or profitability of our business 
in addition  financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts  and we have adopted various policies  controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seek to review and update our policies  controls and procedures 
these policies and procedures may result in increased costs  additional operational personnel  and increased regulatory risk 
failure to adhere to our policies and procedures could result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation 
specific regulatory changes may also have a direct impact on the revenue of our asset management business 
in addition to regulatory scrutiny and potential fines and sanctions  regulators continue to examine different aspects of the asset management industry 
these regulatory changes and other proposed or potential changes may result in a reduction of revenue or an increase in expenses associated with asset management 
the financial services industry faces substantial litigation risks which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant harm to our reputation 
we depend to a large extent on our network of relationships and on our reputation in order to attract and retain clients 
if a client is not satisfied with our services  such dissatisfaction may be more damaging in our business than in other types of businesses 
in our business  we make investment decisions on behalf of our clients which could result in substantial losses to them 
if our clients suffer significant losses  or are otherwise dissatisfied with our services  we could be subject to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct  breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract 
our agreements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services  but these provisions may not protect us or may not be adhered to in all cases 
separately  we may also be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment  among other things 
the above risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
as a result  we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us
