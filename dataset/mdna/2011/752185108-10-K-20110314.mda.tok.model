business overview rand capital corporation rand was incorporated under the law of new york on february  beginning in  rand operated as a publicly traded  closed end  diversified management company that was registered under section of the investment company act of the act 
in  rand elected to be treated as a business development company bdc under the act 
in  rand formed a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of operating it as a small business investment company sbic licensed by the us small business administration sba 
the subsidiary received an sba license to operate as an sbic in august the subsidiary  which had been organized as a delaware limited partnership  was converted into a new york corporation on december   at which time its operations as a licensed small business investment company were continued by a newly formed corporation under the name of rand capital sbic  inc rand sbic 
the following discussion describes the operations of rand  its wholly owned subsidiary rand sbic  and the predecessor wholly owned limited partnership collectively  the corporation 
the corporation anticipates that most  if not all  of its investments in the next year will be originated through rand sbic

table of contents the corporation typically makes investments that range from  to  directly in the equity of a company through equity shares or in a debt instrument 
the debt instruments generally have a maturity of not more than five years and usually have detachable equity warrants 
interest revenue is either paid currently or deferred 
the corporation s management team identifies investment opportunities through a network of investment referral relationships 
investment proposals may  however  come to the corporation from many other sources  including unsolicited proposals from the public and referrals from banks  lawyers  accountants and other members of the financial community 
the corporation believes that its reputation in the investment community and experience provide a competitive advantage in originating qualified new investments 
in a typical private financing  the management team of the corporation will review  analyze  and confirm  through due diligence  the business plan and operations of the potential portfolio company 
additionally  the corporation will become familiar with the portfolio company s industry and competitive landscape and may conduct reference checks with customers and suppliers of the portfolio company 
following an initial investment in a portfolio company  the corporation may make follow on investments in the portfolio company 
follow on investments may be made to take advantage of warrants or other preferential rights granted to the corporation or to increase or maintain the corporation s position in a promising portfolio company 
the corporation may also be called upon to provide an additional investment to a portfolio company in order for that company to fully implement its business plans  to develop a new line of business or to recover from unexpected business problems 
follow on investments in a portfolio company are evaluated individually and may be subject to regulatory restrictions 
the corporation may exit investments through the maturation of a debt security or when a liquidity event takes place  such as the sale  recapitalization  or initial public offering of a portfolio company 
the method and timing of the disposition of the corporation s portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return

table of contents critical accounting policies the corporation prepares its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require the corporation to closely monitor its accounting policies and procedures 
the corporation has two critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most important estimate inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of its investments and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the corporation and submitted to the board of directors for approval 
the corporation invests in loan instruments  debt instruments  and equity instruments 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistent valuation process for each investment 
the corporation analyzes and values each investment on a quarterly basis  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  its equity security has also appreciated in value 
these estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events 
in september the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
on january   the corporation adopted accounting standards codification asc the corporation uses several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment 
the main approaches are loan and debt securities are generally valued at the price the security would command in order to provide a yield to maturity equivalent to the current yield of similar debt securities 
a debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality and collection is in doubt 
a debt security may also be valued based on the estimated proceeds from the sale of a portfolio company at its estimated fair value 
equity securities may be valued using the market approach or income approach 
the market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions 
it may include the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment 
additionally  the corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated  unrelated new investor 
the income approach employs a cash flow and discounting methodology to value an investment 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  used in the corporation s valuation at the measurement date 

table of contents level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value 
all of the corporation s investments at december  are classified in level due to their privately held restricted nature 
in the valuation process  the corporation uses financial information received monthly  quarterly  and annually from its portfolio companies  which includes both audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets prepared by the portfolio company and other financial and non financial business information supplied by the portfolio companies management 
this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio investments 
the valuation may be reduced if a company s performance and potential have significantly deteriorated 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
another key factor used in valuing equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions with unrelated new investors entered into by the portfolio company 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the corporation  and the impact of the discrepancy in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation 
revenue recognition interest income interest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt 
in such cases  interest is recognized at the time of receipt 
a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate 
certain investments of the corporation are structured to provide a deferred interest period where interest is not currently due 
rand sbic s interest accrual is also regulated by the sba s accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for small business investment companies 
under these rules interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful  and a reserve must be established 
the collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than days 
management also utilizes other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest 
the corporation may receive distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies 
these distributions are classified as dividend income on the statement of operations and are recognized when the amount can be reasonably estimated 
recent accounting pronouncements in january the fasb issued asu improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which adds new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of level and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation  inputs and valuation techniques 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of asu did not have a significant impact on the corporation s financial statement disclosures
