on the other hand  considerable weakness in casual consumer titles  particularly in the music and casual genres  which declined in  compared to  was reflected in the decline in the retail sales of software for the wii and handheld devices 
notably  digital distribution channels continue to experience significant growth and are estimated to be up approximately over prior year for north america and europe  based on our internal estimates 
we also estimate that increasing revenues from the digital channel helped to offset weakness at retail  resulting in a total decrease of only year over year for the industry 
we include downloadable games and content  massively multiplayer online subscriptions and value added services  and mobile and social games in our estimates of revenues from this digital channel 
business results and highlights notwithstanding the above mentioned industry dynamics  activision blizzard overall results were strong in consolidated net revenues were billion  and consolidated net income was million  which included a million non cash pre tax charge from the impairment of finite lived intangible assets reflecting the impact of the weaker sales in the casual and music genres

international operations international sales are a fundamental part of our business 
net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately   and of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we maintain significant operations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  germany  france  italy  spain  australia  sweden  south korea  norway  denmark  china  and the netherlands 
we believe that it is important to develop content locally that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs to succeed internationally 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  foreign currency exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
management overview of business trends online content and digital downloads we provide our products through both the retail channel and through digital online delivery methods 
many of our video games that are available through retailers as packaged software products such as dvds are also available by direct digital download through the internet both from websites that we own and from others owned by third parties 
we also offer downloadable content and add ons to our products eg  new multi player map packs and additional songs 
digital online delivered content is generally offered to consumers for a one time fee 
our subscription based services are digitally delivered and hosted by blizzard entertainment proprietary online gaming service  battle 
net 
digital revenues have become an increasingly important part of our business and we continue to focus on and grow them 
for compared to  our sales through digital channels grew year over year 
current generation of game consoles the current generation of game consoles began with microsoft launch of the xbox in  and continued in when sony and nintendo launched the ps and the wii  respectively 
we have seen a significant decline in ps revenues during and as compared to  suggesting that this prior generation platform is very close to being completely replaced by the current generation of consoles 
overall console sales remained strong in  with an installed base of hardware in the us and europe of million units as of december   representing an increase of in units year over year  according to the npd group  with respect to the us  and charttrack and gfk  with respect to europe 
the installed base of ps and xbox hardware units increased year over year  while the installed base of wii hardware units increased only year over year 
we will continue to monitor game console sales to manage our product delivery on each platform in a manner we believe to be most effective 

table of contents concentration of top titles the concentration of retail revenues among key core titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry 
according to the npd group  the top titles accounted for of the sales in the us video game industry in  as compared to in similarly  a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits 
for example  our two key franchises of call of duty and world of warcraft  accounted for over of our net revenues  and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income  in we expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits 
seasonality the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal 
we have historically experienced our highest sales volume in the year end holiday buying season  which occurs in the fourth quarter  and our lowest sales volume in the second quarter of our calendar year 
we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our software titles containing online functionality that constitutes a more than inconsequential separate service deliverable over an extended period of time ie  typically six months to less than a year 
as a result  the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue 
our results can also vary based on a number of factors  including title release dates  consumer demand for our products  market conditions and shipment schedules 
focused product offering and restructuring plan driven by a desire to improve operating margin by focusing activision resources on titles it believes have the best potential for success and the anticipation of a continuing weak environment for casual and music based games  we will be implementing a restructuring plan involving a focus on the development and publication of a reduced slate of titles on a going forward basis 
specifically  we will be disbanding our guitar hero business unit and discontinuing the development of all music based games  including the guitar hero title we had previously planned for in addition  we decided to discontinue development on true crime hong kong due to the concentration of competitive titles in that genre 
the restructuring plan will also involve a re alignment of our cost structure to correspond to our more focused product slate and a related reduction in studio headcount and corporate overhead 
the reduction will result in the separation of approximately employees 
as a result of this shift in our focus  in  we expect fewer overall releases but a more focused slate than in the past two years 
as such  we expect our top line net revenues to be down year over year  primarily due to lower revenues from products with low to no profitability 
in addition  since blizzard had two major releases in and has not yet announced a launch date for its next global release  we are currently assuming two fewer titles from blizzard in and  accordingly  lower revenues

table of contents below as the pro forma basis provides greater comparability for the activision and distribution segments as the supplemental pro forma information reflects pre business combination businesses previously operated by activision  inc the blizzard segment is not affected by any of the pro forma adjustments 
for better understanding of the differences in presentation between our segment results and the consolidated results  the following explains the nature of each reconciling item 
net effect from deferral of net revenues and related cost of sales we have determined that some of our game online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result a more than inconsequential separate deliverable 
as such  we are required to recognize the revenues of these game titles over the estimated service periods 
the product life may range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year 
the related cost of sales is deferred and recognized to match revenues 
in the table above  we present the amount of net revenues and related cost of sales separately for each period as a result of the accounting treatment 
stock based compensation expense we expense our stock based awards using the grant date fair value over the vesting periods of the stock awards 
in the case of liability awards  the liability is subject to revaluation based on the then current stock price 
included within stock based compensation are the net effects of capitalization  deferral  and amortization 
the stock based compensation expenses for each period are presented above 
restructuring we implemented an organizational restructuring plan in the third quarter of as a result of the business combination 
the restructuring activities included severance costs  facility exit costs  write offs of assets and liabilities and exit costs from the cancellation of projects 
on june   we had completed the majority of our organizational restructuring activities as a result of the business combination and do not expect any material costs relating to this item going forward as we have completed these restructuring activities 
however  on february   the board of directors of the company approved a new restructuring plan expected to be implemented in the quarter ending march   resulting in a net pretax charge in the first two quarters of  which is expected to total between and million  comprised of severance costs  the costs of other separation benefits and other exit costs 
this represents a subsequent event that occurs after the balance sheet date 
amortization of intangible assets and purchase price accounting related adjustments all of our intangible assets are the result of the business combination and other acquisitions 
we amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the underlying economic benefits 
the amount presented in the table represents the effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as other purchase price accounting adjustments  where applicable  in our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of intangible assets we recorded a non cash impairment charge on finite lived intangible assets of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflecting a continuing weaker environment for the casual game and music genres 

table of contents integration and transaction costs these costs were incurred to effect the business combination and included activities such as merging systems and streamlining the business processes of the combined company of activision blizzard 
we do not expect any further costs relating to this item going forward as we have completed our integration and transaction activities 
segment net revenues activision activision net revenues decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the following release of fewer key titles in than in and weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres 
in  activision released twelve key titles compared to the release of sixteen key titles in  and blur and singularity  two new intellectual properties that were released in the second quarter of  had only limited market success 
while establishing successful new intellectual properties has always been difficult  the economic environment made it particularly challenging in the decreases were partially offset by the strong performance from call of duty black ops  which was released in the fourth quarter of  continued strong performance of call of duty modern warfare  which was released in november  launch of the call of duty modern warfare stimulus package map pack on microsoft xbox live xblive in the first quarter of and on playstation network psn in the second quarter of  and launch of the call of duty modern warfare resurgence map pack on xblive in the second quarter of and on psn in the third quarter of for  net revenues from the activision segment increased as compared to primarily due to the following as a result of the consummation of the business combination  net revenues of million from the activision businesses operated by activision  inc for the six months ended june  were included in  but not in  launches of two new intellectual properties  dj hero and prototype in  and strong performance from call of duty modern warfare  which was released in november these were partially offset by weaker performance of the guitar hero franchise in versus blizzard blizzard net revenues increased for as compared to primarily as a result of the release of world of warcraft cataclysm in the fourth quarter of and starcraft ii wings of liberty in the third quarter of the increase in net revenues also reflects growth in sales of value added services related to world of warcraft  which consist of transactions such as realm transfers  faction changes  and other character customizations within the world of warcraft gameplay 
the china region business was also back online for the full year of and blizzard successfully launched world of warcraft wrath of the lich king in china in august

this compared to with the successful november release of the second expansion pack of world of warcraft wrath of the lich king 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in other value added service revenues 
distribution distribution net revenues decreased in as compared to  primarily due to weakness in the interactive software industry in the united kingdom uk resulting in lower sales from uk independent retailers and warehousing services

highlights and analysis of our individual segment net revenues and income from operations are as follows pro forma activision segment net revenues activision net revenues decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the release of fewer key titles in than in and weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres  and limited market success of the two new intellectual properties  blur and singularity 
these negative impacts on net revenues were partially offset by the strong performance from call of duty black ops  which was released in the fourth quarter of  and continued strong performance of call of duty modern warfare in retail and its related digital downloadable content 
activision net revenues decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the weakness in the economy adversely impacting the casual game and music genres and the weaker performance of the guitar hero franchise in as compared to  and the decline in sales of ps platform titles due to the aging lifecycle of the ps platform as consumers transitioned to current generation platforms 
partially offsetting these negative impacts on net revenues were the increase in net revenues from the strong performance of call of duty modern warfare  and growth in online digital revenues from call of duty downloadable content

consolidated net revenues increased in north america and asia pacific in as compared to the same period in  primarily due to the success of the call of duty franchise  particularly the release of call of duty black ops in the fourth quarter of and continued strong performance of call of duty modern warfare during the year and the release of world of warcraft cataclysm and starcraft ii wings of liberty in the fourth and third quarters of  respectively  as well as higher 
table of contents revenues from sales of world of warcraft value added services 
the increase in consolidated net revenues in asia pacific was also attributable to the china region business being back online for the full year of and its continued growth with the successful launch of world of warcraft wrath of the lich king in china in august the increase in consolidated net revenues for north america was partially offset by the impact of fewer titles released in and the weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres 
consolidated net revenues for europe decreased in as compared to  primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the greater impact on the decrease in sales of games in the music and casual genres 
the decrease was partially offset by the strong performance of the call of duty franchise in europe  the release of world of warcraft cataclysm and starcraft ii and continued growth in world of warcraft value added services 
the greater success of call of duty black ops sales at initial launch compared to call of duty modern warfare sales at initial launch is the primary reason that less revenue was deferred during as compared to this decrease in deferred revenue was partially offset by the additional deferral of revenue as a result of the release of world of warcraft cataclysm and value added services in the fourth quarter of consolidated net revenues increased in all regions in as compared to  primarily due to the post business combination net revenues consisting of million in north america  million in europe and million in asia pacific from the businesses previously operated by activision  inc for the six month period ended june  that were included in but not in the increase in north america  which was further driven by the strong performance of the call of duty franchise  in particular the release of call of duty modern warfare the increase was partially offset by the impact of weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres in foreign exchange impact changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of approximately million and million on activision blizzard net revenues in and  respectively 
the change is primarily due to the year over year strengthening of the us dollar relative to the british pound and euros

these decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by the stronger performance of the call of duty franchise and the release of starcraft ii wings of liberty and world of warcraft cataclysm and the resulting increase in product costs  more deferred costs recognized consistent with more deferred revenues recognized  during as compared to higher inventory obsolescence charges relating to peripherals  and costs related to our continued focus on customer service for our world of warcraft subscribers

financial disclosure we maintain internal control over financial reporting  which generally includes those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
we also are focused on our disclosure controls and procedures  which as defined by the securities and exchange commission the sec are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non financial information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms  and that such information is communicated to management  including our principal executive and financial officers  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
our disclosure committee  which operates under the board approved disclosure committee charter and disclosure controls procedures policy  includes senior management representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures  as well as in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure process 
as part of our disclosure process  senior finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current quarter operational performance  future trends  subsequent events  internal controls  changes in internal controls and other accounting and disclosure relevant information

with the assistance of the disclosure committee  we will continue to assess and monitor  and make refinements to  our disclosure controls and procedures  and our internal control over financial reporting 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers and once any performance obligations have been completed 
certain products are sold to customers with a street date ie  the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers 
for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date 
revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection 
for our software products with online functionality  we evaluate whether those features or functionality are more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product 
this evaluation is performed for each software product and any online transaction  such as an electronic download of a title with product add ons  when it is released 
determining whether the online service for a particular game constitutes more than an inconsequential deliverable  as well as the estimated service periods and product life over which to recognize the revenue and related costs of sales  are subjective and require management judgment 
when we determine that a software title contains online functionality that constitutes a more than inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product  principally because of its importance to gameplay  we consider that our performance obligations for this title extend beyond the sale of the game 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the online functionality  as we do not separately charge for this component of the title 
as a result  we recognize all of the software related revenue from the sale of the title ratably over the estimated service period  which is estimated to begin the month after either the sale date or the street date of the title  whichever is later 
in addition  we initially defer the costs of sales for the title excluding intangible asset amortization  and recognize the costs of sales as the related revenues are recognized 
cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  software royalties and amortization  and intellectual property licenses 
we recognize world of warcraft boxed product  expansion packs and other value added service revenues each with the related subscription service revenue ratably over the estimated service periods beginning upon activation of the software and delivery of the services 
revenues attributed to the sale of world of warcraft boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as product sales and revenues attributable to subscription and other value added services are classified as subscription  licensing and other revenues 
revenue for software products with more than inconsequential separate service deliverables and world of warcraft products are recognized over the estimated service periods  which range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year 
for our software products with features we consider to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable  such as products which provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer  we recognize the related revenue from them upon the transfer of title and risk of loss of the product to our customer 
allowances for returns  price protection  doubtful accounts  and inventory obsolescence 
we may permit product returns from  or grant price protection to  our customers under certain conditions 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to decrease the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and  when granted and applicable  allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and or future invoices 
the conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection include  among other things  compliance with applicable trading and payment terms  and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell through reports to us 
we may also consider other factors  including the facilitation of slow moving inventory and other market factors 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue 
we estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical 
table of contents experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
the following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title historical performance of titles in similar genres  historical performance of the hardware platform  historical performance of the franchise  console hardware life cycle  sales force and retail customer feedback  industry pricing  weeks of on hand retail channel inventory  absolute quantity of on hand retail channel inventory  our warehouse on hand inventory levels  the title recent sell through history if available  marketing trade programs  and performance of competing titles 
the relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon  among other items  genre  platform  seasonality  and sales strategy 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period 
based upon historical experience  we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including  among others  a lack of consumer acceptance of a title  the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor  or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms 
material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period may result if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection 
for example  a change in our december  allowance for sales returns  price protection and other allowances would impact net revenues by approximately million 
similarly  management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customers payment terms and their economic condition  as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance 
any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel 
we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value  based upon assumptions about future demand  which are inherently difficult to assess 
at the point of a loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis 
software development costs and intellectual property licenses 
software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements  as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products 
we account for software development costs in accordance with the fasb guidance for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed asc subtopic 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable 
technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation  or the completed and tested product design and working model 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established 
for products where proven technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
prior to a product release  we expense  as part of cost of sales software royalties and amortization  capitalized costs if and when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense 

table of contents commencing upon product release  capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product  generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less 
intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks  copyrights  software  technology  music  or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products 
depending upon the agreement with the rights holder  we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years  or alternatively  for a single product 
prior to the related product release  we expense  as part of cost of sales intellectual property licenses  capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
commencing upon the related product release  capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized 
as intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years  the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis 
for products that have been released in prior periods  the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance 
for products that are scheduled to be released in future periods  recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used 
criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology  orders for the product prior to its release  and  for any sequel product  estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based 
further  as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years  we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors  such as the success of other products and or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property  whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property  and the rights holder continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs 
in evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs  the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred 
if revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis  the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter  which could result in an impairment charge 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors 
income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with fasb income tax guidance asc topic  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of asc topic and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset  liability or equity instrument being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective  and  if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  which is an asset that is not amortized 
often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset  the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in process technology 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 
assessment of impairment of assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with fasb literature related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets within asc subtopic  which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists 
we considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether 
table of contents the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable including  but not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and changes in our business strategy 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million to our finite lived intangible assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the determination of the impairment charges recorded for the year ended december  fasb literature related to the accounting for goodwill and other intangibles within asc topic requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit 
our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
asc topic requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
to determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  and future economic and market conditions 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the value of stock based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial lattice model 
our determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors

the amendments in this update also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this update on january  will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an update to software certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this update changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality  and excludes these products from the scope of current software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine which software elements are considered essential to the functionality 
the amendments will now subject software enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements  such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this update on january  will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices 
our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and market prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
currency volatility is monitored throughout the year 
to mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure resulting from our foreign currency denominated monetary assets  liabilities and earnings  we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts  principally swaps and forward contracts with maturities of twelve months or less 
vivendi is our principal counterparty and the risks of counterparty non performance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
we expect to continue to use economic hedge programs in the future to reduce foreign exchange related volatility if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk 
we do not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
all foreign currency economic hedging transactions are backed  in amount and by maturity  by an identified economic underlying item 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and the associated gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in investment and other income  net and general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange swaps was million and million at december  and  respectively 
a pre tax net unrealized gain of less than a million and an unrealized loss of million for the years ended and  respectively  resulted 
table of contents from the foreign exchange contracts and swaps with vivendi and were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  australian dollars  south korean won  and swedish krona 
the consolidated statements of operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses  and net income from our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
from time to time  we hedge our foreign currency translation risk by entering into foreign exchange contracts with vivendi 
we recognized a realized loss of million for the year ended december  from the settlement of the hedging foreign exchange contracts and there was no outstanding foreign exchange contract hedging translation risk as of december  as of december   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of would have resulted potential declines in our net income of approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities and money market funds that invest in aaa rated government backed securities 
because short term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash  cash equivalents or short term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
conversely  the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
at december   our billion of cash and cash equivalents was comprised primarily of money market funds 
at december   our million of short term investments included million of us treasury and government sponsored agency debt securities  and million of restricted cash 
we also had million in auction rate securities at fair value classified as long term investments at december  most of our investment portfolio is invested in short term or variable rate securities 
the company has determined that  based on our investment portfolio as of december   there was no material interest rate risk exposure to the company consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of that date
