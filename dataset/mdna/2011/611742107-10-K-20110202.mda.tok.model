fair value measurement the company values its assets and liabilities using the methods of fair value as described in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures

the three levels of fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
in determining fair value  the company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible  and considers counter party credit risk in its assessment of fair value 
observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect the company s assumptions based on the best information available
