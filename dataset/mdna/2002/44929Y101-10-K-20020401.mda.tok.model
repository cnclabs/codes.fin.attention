item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues as services are performed  generally based on hours of work incurred 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues 
deferred revenues totaled approximately  and as of december  and  respectively  which are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
management believes that its revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estiamted allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts if our future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as certain of our customers provide a high percent of total revenues and corresponding receivables 
long lived assets the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets to measure recoverability 
if impairment exists  measurement of the impairment will be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies 
no such impairments were recognized in any of the periods presented 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the company has recorded no valuation reserves for deferred tax assets as of december  although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts valuation allowances if required 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues operating expenses cost of services selling  general and administrative operating income interest expense

quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant quarterly variations in operating results  principally as a result of the timing of client programs  the commencement and expiration of contracts  the timing and amount of new business generated by the company  the company s revenue mix  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support the growth and development of existing and new business units and competitive industry conditions 
historically  the company s business tends to be strongest in the second and fourth quarters due to the high level of client sales activity in the spring and prior to the holiday season in the fall 
in the first quarter  crm services activity generally levels off or slows from the previous quarter as a result of reduced client sales activity and client transitions to new marketing programs during the first quarter of the calendar year 
in addition  the company typically expands its operations in the first quarter to support anticipated business growth beginning in the second quarter 
as a result  selling  general and administrative costs typically increase in the first quarter without a commensurate increase in revenues  which results in decreased profitability for the first quarter versus the previous fourth quarter 
also  demand for the company s services typically slows or decreases in the third quarter as the volume of business decreases during the summer months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses increase during the third quarter as it expands its capacity in anticipation of higher demand for its services during the fourth quarter

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable rate line of credit 
a change in market interest rates exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instrument 
the rate on million of outstanding borrowings at december  approximated market rates  thus  the fair value of the debt approximates its reported value 
in the past the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
foreign currency risk the company historically has not used foreign currency exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
the company has operations in canada  ireland  the united kingdom  and australia that are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of income statements of these operations from local currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
the company s foreign operations represent of the company s consolidated revenues for the year ended december  in addition  foreign operations produced of the business associated with domestic revenues 
management does not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material
