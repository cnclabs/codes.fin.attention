item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies  which provide the capability to connect standard telecommunications equipment including standard telephones  fax machines  data modems and alarm panels with wireless communication networks in the cellular and pcs frequency bands collectively cellular 
applications of the company s technology include wireless local loop  a primary access service where wireline systems are unavailable  unreliable or uneconomical 
the company s business segments are divided between its two principal product lines phonecell r  a line of cellular fixed wireless terminals and cellular fixed wireless desktop phones collectively fixed wireless terminals or fwts  and telguard r  a line of wireless security products 
currently  the company is devoting a substantial portion of its resources to international market development  extension of its core product line to new cellular wireless standards  expansion  protection and licensing of its intellectual property rights and development of underlying radio technology 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act that is set forth in exhibit to this document 
overview major trends driving the market for the company s products include a broad consumer acceptance of cellular communications  rapid privatization of telecommunications in developed and developing countries  adoption of next generation digital wireless transmission standards that enhance network capacity and service  service network providers acceptance of cellular fwts as cost effective answers to customer demand for basic telecommunications and the trend of licensing multiple cellular operators in a given region  which intensifies competition among cellular wireless service providers to capture additional minutes of usage and the potential for a large wireline bypass market 
wireless local loop wll  which is the core of the company s prospects for the phonecell r business in developing countries  involves fwts operating on cellular networks built primarily for handheld cellular phone users 
fwt sales generally begin developing after a cellular network has been in operation for a few years  when the growth rate in new mobile cellular phone subscribers slows and the mobile operator begins looking for new revenue sources 
fwts are the better choice than handheld cellular phones for the wll market  because they offer longer talk time  better reception  and can be easily linked to phones  fax machines and computers 
among the benefits for network operators  fwts generally generate higher average billable airtime and increase demand during off peak times when available system capacity is high 
the company s strategy is to leverage its years of experience in the market  internationally accepted products and court tested patents into a leadership position in the cellular fixed wireless industry 
wireless network operators and their distribution partners are increasingly sharing the company s vision that cellular systems in both developed and developing countries are well suited for use as basic telephone service networks

the final assembly of phonecell r and telguard r products is performed at the company s facility in vernon hills  illinois  except for the phonecell r sx desktop phones and phonecell r sx products  which are assembled by a contract manufacturer in mexico 
the cellular fixed wireless industry consists of large domestic and international telecommunications equipment companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than those of the company  and includes companies such as nokia  ericsson and lg electronics 
the company also competes with a number of smaller companies that have arisen in markets where enforcement of the company s patent protection is not available or practicable 
the company competes with these companies primarily on the basis of its higher product quality and reliability  state of the art technology and enhanced features  rapid product innovation and customer support 
although the company s participation in the wireless security products industry has been focused on the north american market  the new gsm telguard r tg product is expected to aid the company in opening up global security products markets 
the competitive environment has been previously dominated by a few major equipment suppliers  who have leveraged proprietary systems to maintain their market share 
the company has adopted an innovator role  and has competed successfully by introducing innovative new wireless technology into the marketplace 
with respect to its interface technology  the company currently has issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states  as well as foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications

critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are several of the more critical accounting policies that currently affect the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
inventories the company values inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
the company currently considers inventory quantities greater than a one year supply based on current year activity as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be excess 
the company also provides for the total value of inventories that are determined to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september  and  the inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuance of product lines  changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could result in significant changes in required reserves 
impairment the company periodically evaluates the fair value and recoverability of the goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements of each of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in analyzing fair value and recoverability  the company makes projections regarding future cash flows 
these projections are based on assumptions and estimates of growth rates for the related business segment  anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions  the assignment of discount rates relative to risk and estimates of terminal values 
the company also considers the volatility of its stock price and a potential control premium which would most likely be realized in an equity event 
an impairment loss is assessed and recognized in operating earnings when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
based upon observed trends  the company believes that the market for cellular fwts will experience substantial growth over the next five years 
the company has identified significant growth opportunities in africa  brazil  china  europe  india  mexico  venezuela and the usa 
each of these markets will develop at a different pace  and the sales cycle for these regions are likely to be several months or quarters 
further  economic conditions play an important role in the timing of market development for the company s products 
in connection with the present global economic slowdown  the company s prospects for continued growth have been accordingly reduced in the near term 
however  as economic conditions improve  the company is well positioned with a wide range of products to capitalize on these market opportunities 
over the last two years  there has been considerable price pressure in the cellular fwt market  particularly for cdma products 
most cdma products are manufactured in korea  where several manufacturers are competing for the same business 
there appears to be a glut of cdma products  which has resulted in very low prices 
the company expects this trend to continue until next generation xrtt cdma networks and products become generally available 
the company expects to improve its position in the gsm fwt markets with the launch of its phonecell r sx gsm products with gprs in gprs in gsm networks also allow for the use of high speed data applications 
the company expects the market for cellular fwts to be favorably impacted by xrtt and gprs once these services become generally available  especially in developed countries 
shipments under the company s agreement with telcel to supply million desktop phones dated september   were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the absence of desktop phone shipments to mexico during the first quarter of fiscal year resulted in a significant decline in net product sales 
on january   telcel ordered additional desktop phones under the above agreement and the company shipped the additional desktop phones to mexico from february through june on june   telcel extended the above agreement  to include a million order subsequently increased to million for more desktop phones to be shipped from august through january in addition  on june   the company received a letter of intent from telcel indicating its intent to acquire an additional million in desktop phones after december provided that there is a demand for such phones in the consumer market in mexico

it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
for example  there are a number of uncertainties as to the degree and duration of the revenue momentum  which could impact the company s ability to be profitable as lower sales may likely result in lower margins 
in addition  product development expenditures  which are expected to benefit future periods  are likely to have a negative impact on near term earnings 
other risks and uncertainties  which are discussed in exhibit to this filing  include the risk that technological change will render the company s technology obsolete  ability to protect intellectual property rights in its products  unfavorable economic conditions could lead to lower product sales  the risk of litigation  the company s ability to develop new products  the company s dependence on suppliers and contractors  the company s ability to maintain quality control  the risk of doing business in developing markets  the company s dependence on research and development  the uncertainty of additional funding  dilution of ownership to stockholders resulting from financing activities  volatility of common stock price  intense industry competition including competition from its licensees and new market entrants with cellular phone docking station products and the uncertainty in the development of wireless service generally
