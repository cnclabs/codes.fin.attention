certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation 
we provide cross border managed data communications services to multinational corporations worldwide 
we offer our services to our clients directly through country representatives and indirectly through alternate sales channels consisting of major international telecommunications carriers and value added resellers 
we deploy a broad array of fully managed data communications services over our reliable  secure  and high quality global network  which we refer to as the world network 
the world network is an extensive and versatile atm based network that can be accessed by our clients from over countries 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements estimating valuation allowances for revenue credits and accounts receivable the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
specifically  our management must make estimates of future customer credits for the services provided during the reporting period through the analysis of historical trends and known events 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the revenue reserves associated with discounts earned on special customer agreements  billing reserves for pricing changes and customer disputes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue adjustments if management projections differ from actual results 
similarly  our management must make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of march   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and credits of million 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available information and other factors  that we will not realize some portion or all of our deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of current information including  among other things  estimates of future earnings in different tax jurisdictions and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit to income tax expense any adjustments to the valuation allowance in the period in which these determinations are made 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  then in accordance with provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  we would charge to income tax expense an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the period this determination was made 
should our near term operating results be significantly less than our current expectations  we may record a valuation allowance equal to all or substantially all of our net deferred tax assets which totaled million as of march  impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be recoverable 
if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value  a write down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value 
for purposes of estimating future cash flows from possibly impaired assets  we group assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
we monitor and evaluate the viability of the network service providers from which we have purchased bandwidth 
the term purchased bandwidth refers to transmission capacity contractually acquired under long term prepaid leases  capitalized leases and irus indefeasible rights of use 
in instances where the network services provider is determined to be no longer viable and any disruption of service is permanent  
table of contents we will write off the remaining net book value of the asset 
during  we wrote off purchased bandwidth with a net book value of million 
components of revenues we measure revenue by three different means by service  by distribution channel and by region 
revenues by service our revenues are derived from providing a broad range of integrated service solutions to our multinational clients worldwide network services which include intranet  broadband  internet  remote access and wireless access services  consulting  integration and provisioning services which include consulting  design  and implementation of each client s particular networking needs and also includes our global connect services whereby we install and manage leased lines and customer premise equipment at the client s site to enable the client to access the world network and use our network services  applications services which include messaging  collaboration  call center  web hosting and other value added services  and other communications services which include x 
transport services  service access fees and other communications services 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues from the sale of network services  specifically intranet services  remote access and ip vpn services 
we expect that network services will continue to constitute the largest component of our revenue base going forward 
we also anticipate that a significant portion of our future revenue growth will come from network services and consulting  integration and provisioning services 
our other communications services revenues include outsourcing services under the arrangements with aucs  which are expected to terminate in october see discussion below 
excluding outsourcing services  other communication services revenues have declined over the last two fiscal years 
we expect this decline to continue as our clients transfer to non x 
based transport services and as we cease to provide the outsourcing services 
revenues by distribution channel we offer our services through country representatives and through alternate sales channels such as major telecommunication service providers  value added resellers  and licensed distributors 
in the year ended march   country representatives contributed of our total revenues  while alternate sales channels contributed of our total revenues 
most of the outsourcing services revenues have been categorized as alternate sales channel revenue 
we expect revenues from the outsourcing clients we retain to become country representative revenues 
country representatives 
we currently have country representatives  consolidated and non consolidated  which together provide services in more than countries and territories 
our consolidated country representatives are those in which we own  directly or indirectly  greater than a equity interest 
our consolidated country representatives provide services in countries and accounted for approximately million  or approximately of our total revenues  in the year ended march  our service agreements with our country representatives generally give us the right to recommend prices for services  set revenue targets jointly  determine staffing jointly  in many cases appoint one of the three members of the advisory review board  and terminate the agreement if the country representative fails to meet the revenue targets or if we cannot agree on revenue targets for two consecutive years 
in addition  each agreement outlines 
table of contents the compensation and pricing arrangements with the country representatives 
established rates and support charges are generally the same for all country representatives throughout the world 
our country representatives determine the prices they charge clients  in accordance with our recommended prices and standard discounts  and enter into contracts with clients to provide services using the world network 
we bill our country representatives and recognize the full amount of revenues for all of our services delivered to the clients 
the country representatives bill us for the sales and support services they provide  which we account for as country representative compensation 
the country representative bears the risk of collection from the client as well as the exchange rate risk 
alternate sales channels 
our alternate sales channels sell or take orders for all or a portion of our suite of services in their territories to clients that require one or more of our global communications services that the alternate sales channels do not supply independently 
our relationships typically are governed by multi year contracts  under which we provide services to our alternate sales channels who then solicit orders for our services or resell our services to clients on terms our sales channels determine 
revenues by region we provide our services throughout the world  with revenues billed and costs incurred in more than countries and territories 
we are organized into three regions americas  europe  middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific 
due to the multinational nature of our client base  the regional revenues are not based on where the services are provided  but rather on the jurisdiction in which we invoice our services 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues in the emea region  and we expect that revenues from that region will continue to comprise the largest component of our revenue base going forward 
we have experienced significant revenue growth in the asia pacific region and anticipate that we will experience a significant portion of our future revenue growth in that region as well as in the americas 
pricing the pricing for our services differs depending on the services provided  the speed of service  geographic location and capacity utilization 
in the case of services permitting dedicated client access to the network by leased circuit  pricing generally depends more on the nature and capacity of the service provided than on actual usage 
for example  the pricing for a connection to be used for intranet services generally consists of a monthly charge for the connection and the bandwidth access provided through the connection 
pricing for dedicated access services is therefore largely based on access equipment and bandwidth 
in the case of remote access services  actual usage and geographic location are more relevant to the pricing determination  as the client is generally charged based on the duration of each connected session 
once a base service is set  additional factors are taken into account such as charges for additional network services  breadth of the service  and discounts for larger volume clients that are prepared to guarantee specific revenue levels 
as a result of increasing competition in the markets we serve  our customers frequently transition to more cost effective solutions offered by us when they renew their contracts 
as a result  we may provide more services to our customers at the same or even reduced prices under the renewed contract 
we refer to this as price erosion 
due to the fact that services provided under renewed contracts may not be directly comparable to the services provided under the previous contracts  we cannot accurately quantify the effects of price erosion 
we expect this trend to continue for at least the near term 
client contracts the client contracts generally include an agreed upon price schedule that details both fixed and variable prices for contracted services 
the client contracts generally have a term of one to three years  however  when clients implement a number of our services  they may choose to extend the contracts for a longer period of time 
our country representatives can easily add additional services to existing contracts  enabling clients to increase the number of locations through which they access our network  increase the speed of that access  increase the sophistication of the services they use  or extend the term for existing services 

table of contents outsourcing and management agreements with aucs as described more thoroughly in item  we are party to several agreements with aucs communications services nv  unisource  the then owner of aucs unisource has since been liquidated  and three of our stockholders  kpn  swisscom and telia  who are the owners of aucs 
as part of our arrangement with aucs  we assumed aucs obligations to provide various services to its clients 
we obtain the services from aucs under a service agreement that provides us a gross margin of approximately on the provision of these services 
the revenues and expenses resulting from this arrangement are referred to throughout this discussion as outsourcing services revenues and expenses 
our services agreement with aucs has been terminated effective as of october   at which time we will cease to receive these outsourcing services revenues 
in addition to providing the aucs services  we sell our services to these multinational clients as a supplement or replacement for services previously provided by aucs  with the expectation that  over time  this would result in the normal and transparent transition of these multinational clients onto the world network and the use of our services 
we will continue to use the aucs platform to deliver all or some of the aucs services to the remaining multinational clients until october  when the aucs agreement terminates  or until we can transition the remaining clients to our services  whichever occurs first 
we expect outsourcing services revenues to continue to decline as the aucs clients either transition to the world network or cease to use the aucs service 
as our outsourcing services revenues decline  our outsourcing expenses  included in country representative compensation  will also decline because we are no longer providing the services 
in addition to the outsourcing arrangement with aucs  we entered into a three year management agreement with aucs that is expected to terminate on october  under the management agreement  we earn a fee equal to of the outsourcing services revenues  subject to a defined maximum  and we can earn an incentive payment based upon the achievement of defined financial performance criteria 
during fiscal and  we received approximately million and million  respectively  in management fees from aucs 
we expect that we will receive significantly less than these amounts in fiscal because the management agreement is scheduled to expire on october   at which time we will cease to receive any management fees from aucs 
our arrangements also include an incentive payment  which is a one time fee that will be paid  assuming the performance criteria are met  upon the termination of the management agreement 
we cannot assure you that the performance criteria will be met and that we will receive any incentive fee 
prior to october   we expect to enter into a termination agreement to memorialize the termination of the management agreement and related agreements 
that termination agreement  if entered into  may provide for i the purchase of certain equipment by us from aucs ii the provision of certain services by us to aucs and by aucs to us for a limited period of time after october  in order to ensure a smooth transition after the management agreement terminates and iii an agreed amount for the incentive payment to be made to us under the management agreement 
at this time  although we expect to begin discussions regarding the termination agreement soon  we do not have any understanding with the other parties on the terms of any such agreement  including an estimate of the amount of any incentive payment that may be made to us under the terms of the management agreement 
components of costs and expenses country representative compensation country representative compensation reflects the amounts paid to the country representatives for the sales and support services our country representatives provide to clients 
these expenses are variable and increase as the revenues from country representatives increase 
during fiscal  and  country representative compensation also included amounts paid to aucs for services provided under the outsourcing agreement 
bandwidth and related costs our bandwidth and related costs are primarily comprised of leasing and amortization expenses associated with the leasing or purchasing of network circuits 
traditionally  we obtained backbone capacity through short term leases 
we bear leasing expenses regardless of whether we lease directly or indirectly through another entity that may lease communications lines locally on our behalf 
as bandwidth prices began to drop and capacity became available for purchase  we began to replace some of our short term leases on major international and regional routes with much more economical longer term solutions 
currently  the majority of our backbone 
table of contents network was purchased and the amortization of these assets is included as an expense 
we expect to continue to purchase such longer term capacity where it is economical to do so  although we retain the flexibility to obtain short term leases when appropriate 
bandwidth and related costs also include related equipment  maintenance and personnel costs 
network operations our network operations expenses include costs associated with our network management  operations and support activities 
these costs include personnel  occupancy  maintenance  equipment depreciation  outsourcing costs and other network related costs 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and incentive compensation related to our consolidated country representative sales force  as well as costs related to providing centralized sales and marketing support for our non consolidated country representatives 
our selling expenses also include promotion  advertising  travel and entertainment 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other compensation  and occupancy costs for executive  financial and accounting  human resources  legal and other administrative personnel  as well as company wide management incentive related costs 
impact of aucs transition over the past two and a half years  outsourcing services revenues have been reported in consulting  integration provisioning services for access related services and other communications services for all other services 
we expect many of the clients on the aucs platform that ultimately transition to the infonet platform to transition during september or october  we cannot estimate the number of clients using the aucs platform that ultimately will transition to the infonet platform 
to the extent this business transitions to infonet s platform in the next few months  the revenue generated from these accounts will no longer be reflected in other communications services  but instead will be reported in the appropriate product based category 
the expenses related to most outsourcing services revenues have been paid at approximately of revenues to aucs and have been reported as country representative compensation 
to the extent that transitioned business is managed by our non consolidated country representatives  we will make country representative compensation payments  based on current agreements  to the respective country representatives 
to the extent the business is sold via alternate channels  there will be no country representative compensation  but we will incur incremental expense for multinational support 
additionally  the incremental bandwidth and related  network operations  and sales  general  and administrative expenses associated with these revenues will be included in the appropriate category 
compensation charges related to stock option and stock appreciation rights grants in april  we granted options to employees for the purchase of approximately million shares of our class b common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to our stock option plan 
the stock option plan was a book value plan  which converted to a market value plan upon the close of our initial public offering  creating a new measurement date for the stock options 
since the exercise price of these options was substantially below the price to the public of per share in the offering  we will record a non cash compensation charge over the five year vesting period of the options 
the amount of this charge is a function of the public offering price 
based upon the price of our class b common stock in the offering  this charge will total approximately million  of which approximately million  million and million was recognized in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the remaining charge will be amortized to expense at a rate of approximately million per quarter through december  during december  we issued approximately million stock appreciation rights  or sars  and during the fiscal year ended march  we issued approximately  sars to employees pursuant to our sars plan 
the sars vest per year  commencing in january  and are indexed to our class b common stock at a base price of per share 
we recorded a compensation charge in each quarter of the 
table of contents vesting period based upon the difference between the exercise price and market value of our class b common stock during the vesting period 
the total amount of this charge is a function of the price of our class b common stock during the vesting period 
during the fiscal year ended march   these charges were approximately million 
as of march   approximately  sars have been forfeited by employees 
during the fiscal year ended march   we amended our sars plan to provide for a tandem feature which allows for the settlement of the sars with shares of our class b common stock as an alternative to a cash settlement 
the amended sars plan provides that the sars may be settled with stock or cash at our sole discretion 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock options or award plans  we are accounting for the tandem award as equity instruments and the plan  as amended  as a fixed plan under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the amendment to the sars plan created a new measurement date 
we credited stock related compensation by approximately million to reflect the stock price at the new measurement date 
the remaining unrecognized compensation expense of approximately million at march   will be amortized ratably over the remaining vesting period at a rate of approximately  per quarter through december  during each of the fiscal years ended march  and  these charges were approximately million 
additionally  we grant stock options to certain consultants and other non employee personnel 
these options are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which triggers stock based compensation expense that is included in our results of operations 
through the fiscal year ended march   these charges were immaterial

table of contents year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues revenues by service revenues decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the decrease in revenues was principally the result of a decrease of million  or  in revenues from other communications services  which were partially offset by increases of million  or  in revenues from network services and million  or  in revenues from consulting  integration and provisioning services 
most of the growth in revenues from network services came from an million increase in sales of intranet services 
most of the growth in revenues from consulting  integration and provisioning services was the result of our clients need for local access services to connect to the world network 
the decrease in revenues from other communications services was primarily the result of a million decrease in outsourcing services revenues discussed in more detail below and an expected million decline in our mature x 
transport services as our clients are migrating to more advanced  non x 
based transport services 
we expect that network services will continue to constitute the largest component of our revenue base going forward 
we also anticipate that a significant portion of our future revenue growth will come from network services and consulting  integration and provisioning services 
outsourcing services revenues decreased million from million in the in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this decrease is the result of aucs clients ceasing to use aucs services or  to a lesser extent  transitioning to our services under the world network 
as the termination of the aucs outsourcing agreement approaches  we expect that we will continue to see a decrease in outsourcing services revenues 
of the million decrease in outsourcing services revenues  million was in other communications services 
excluding the effect of outsourcing services revenues  revenues increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the increase is attributable to network services  which increased million as described above and consulting  integration and provisioning services  which increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this revenue includes revenue from clients previously on the aucs platform  which was recorded as outsourcing services  that have transitioned to the infonet platform 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from other communications services of million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  revenues by distribution channel revenues from our country representatives increased slightly  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march   despite a increase in the number of our country representative clients from  as of march  to  as of march  and an increase in the number of our country representatives from as of march  to as of march  the slight increase in revenues from our country representatives was primarily impacted by the decline in outsourcing services revenues and the effect of price erosion on our core business as customers transition to a more cost effective solution offered by us 
excluding the effect of the decrease in outsourcing services revenues  revenues from country representatives increased by million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  revenues from our alternate sales channels decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march   as a result of a decline in our alternate sales channel partners clients from  clients as of march  to clients as of march  the decline represents a decline of outsourcing services clients partially offset by an increase of non outsourcing services clients 
excluding the effects of the decrease in outsourcing services revenues  revenues from alternate sales channels increased million from million in the march  to million in the year ended march  this increase is net of price erosion as customers transition to a more cost effective solution offered by us 

table of contents revenues by region the largest portion of our revenue decrease  billed on a regional basis  occurred in the emea region where revenues decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this decrease is the result of a million decrease in outsourcing services revenue partially offset by an increase in non outsourcing services revenues due to the addition of new clients and increased sales to existing clients 
revenues billed in the americas decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  due primarily to price erosion as customers transition to a more cost effective solution offered by us 
revenues billed in the asia pacific region increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this increase was largely attributable to our increased sales efforts in this region combined with the overall growth in this market 
expenses country representative compensation expense decreased from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  approximately million of this decrease is related to outsourcing services revenues 
the offsetting increase results from a change in product mix and the impact of varying margins between products 
bandwidth and related costs decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  lease expense  the largest component of bandwidth and related costs  decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  amortization of purchased bandwidth increased million  from million to million over the period 
both the decrease in lease expense and the increase in amortization were a result of owning a larger portion of our bandwidth capacity in the backbone of our network 
the year ended march  also includes a charge of million related to the impairment of purchased bandwidth from a bankrupt network service provider 
the total net book value of the purchased bandwidth related to service providers which have declared bankruptcy as of march  capitalized on our financial statements is approximately million 
in addition  subsequent to our fiscal year end  another one of our service providers declared bankruptcy 
the net book value of the purchased bandwidth related to this service provider and its subsidiaries was approximately million on march  if we experience permanent disruption in services on these facilities  an impairment charge may be recorded 
currently  there are efforts underway to remedy the situation via a variety of business initiatives 
consequently  we are unable to predict the timing of such charges  if any become necessary 
management routinely monitors the situation and will take appropriate action in accordance with our accounting policy  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
network operations expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation expense related to network equipment of million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  in the year ended march   we incurred million in support services outsourced to third parties 
additionally  stock related compensation charges increased million  from  in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  a one time stock related compensation credit of million in the prior period resulted from an amendment to one of our stock based compensation plans 
the remainder of the increase was related to the increased costs associated with our network management  operations and support activities  personnel costs and other network operations expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  our sales support expenses for multinational activities increased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  which was directly related to increased multinational support required to service our customers 
sales and marketing personnel related expenses increased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  due to increased 
table of contents sales and marketing efforts to increase our revenues 
stock related compensation charges increased million  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  a one time stock related compensation credit of million in the prior year resulted from an amendment to one of our stock based compensation plans 
additionally  during the year ended march   a non cash million stock related compensation charge related to the acceleration of vesting of options of a terminated employee was offset by a non cash million credit related to the forfeiture of non vested options of other terminated employees 
administrative expenses  excluding stock related compensation expense  increased by million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  advertising expense decreased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  operating income loss decreased by million  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  because of a decrease in revenues and increased expenses as discussed above 
other income expense decreased million  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this decrease reflects a decrease in interest income of million  from million to million  due to lower interest rates and lower cash balances as funds were used for capital expenditures during fiscal year other  net for the year ended march  included a loss of million related to the reduction of the carrying value of a non marketable investment offset by million of gains on sale of marketable securities 
provision for income taxes decreased from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  primarily because of decreased income and  to a lesser degree  by tax benefits from foreign subsidiary loss utilization 
net income loss decreased from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  due to the factors described above 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues revenues by service revenues increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the increase in revenues was principally the result of increases of million  or  in revenues from network services  million  or  in revenues from consulting  integration and provisioning services and million  or  in other communication services 
most of the growth in revenues from network services came from increases in sales of intranet and remote access services 
intranet sales increased million  or  from million to million and remote access sales increased million  or  from million to million  over the period from march  to march  the increases in consulting  integration and provisioning services and other communication services included approximately million and million  respectively  in revenues from outsourcing services that were earned as a result of our providing outsourcing services for the full period compared to only a six month period in the prior year 
excluding revenues from outsourcing services  revenues increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  excluding revenues from outsourcing services  consulting  integration and provisioning services  comprised primarily of our global connect services  increased million  or  from million to million over the period  and other communications services declined million  or  from million to million 
this decrease was largely due to an expected decline in our mature messaging product line and our x 
transport services  as our clients migrated to more advanced messaging applications and non x 
based transport services  offset by a one time commitment fee paid by one of our sales channel partners of million 

table of contents revenues by distribution channel revenues from our country representatives increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  excluding outsourcing services  revenues from country representatives increased million  or  from million to million over the year 
outsourcing revenue  which began mid year during the prior period  declined by approximately million related to a one time recognition of contract termination fees during the prior year 
while the number of our country representatives remained at over the period  revenue increases were derived through the growth of existing country representatives 
the number of our clients increased  from  clients as of march  to  clients as of march  revenues increased as clients that used mostly lower revenue generating messaging and x 
based transport services were replaced by clients that purchased higher revenue yielding network services 
revenues from our alternate sales channels grew million  or  from million to million over the period 
approximately million of the increase resulted from outsourcing services as revenues from the outsourcing business were earned for a full year period as compared to a six month period in the prior year 
the balance of the increase is primarily attributed to growth through existing sales channel partners 
in total  our alternate sales channel partners resold our suite of services to fewer clients  from  clients as of march  to  clients as of march  revenues by region the majority of our growth in revenues by region occurred in the emea region  which increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  approximately million of this revenue growth was in europe resulting from outsourcing services as revenues from the outsourcing business were earned for a full year period as compared to a six month period in the prior year 
the balance of the increase is due to the addition of new clients and increases in sales of services to existing clients 
revenues billed in the americas grew million  or  from million to million over the period 
revenues billed in asia pacific increased by million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march   due to increased sales efforts in a growing market 
expenses country representative compensation increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  approximately million of this increase resulted from outsourcing services revenues 
the balance of this expense grew in line with the related revenue 
bandwidth and related costs increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this increase was directly related to higher network leasing expenses associated with increasing the capacity of our network and our newly introduced atm capability  although the unit cost had dropped significantly 
the usage growth reflects additional client port growth and increased capacity per port  as well as the building of an infrastructure with lower capacity utilization 
lease expense  the largest component of bandwidth and related costs  increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  amortization of purchased bandwidth increased million  or  from million to million over the period as a result of owning a major portion of our bandwidth capacity in the backbone of our network 
network operations expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  stock related compensation charges decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to  in the year ended march  depreciation expense related to network equipment increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the remainder of the increase was related to the increased costs associated with our network management  operations and support activities  personnel costs and other network operations expenses  which grew in line with our revenues 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  stock related compensation charges decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  our sales support expenses for multinational activities increased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  which was directly related to revenue growth

provision for income taxes increased from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the effective tax rate in the year ended march  is lower than experienced in the prior year because non deductible stock based compensation charges and deferred tax valuation allowance decreased

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended march  was million compared to million during the year ended march  this fluctuation was primarily a result of changes in accounts receivable  which provided cash of million in the year ended march  compared to a use of cash of million in the year ended march  an increase in deferred income taxes provided an increase in cash of million 
additionally  depreciation and amortization increased by million in the year ended march  due to the expansion of the world network and newly introduced atm capability 
these changes were partially offset by changes in  other current assets  which decreased cash by million  accounts payable  which decreased cash by million  income taxes payable  which decreased cash by million  and network communications payable  which decreased cash by million 
additionally  net income decreased by million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to million during the year ended march  this fluctuation was primarily due to purchases of securities available for sale during the prior year and a decrease in purchases of property  equipment and communication lines of million 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended march  this fluctuation was the result of net proceeds from issuance of long term obligations during the year ended march  in december  we acquired a new four story  approximately  square foot  office building adjacent to our existing headquarter facilities to accommodate current and future growth 
the building was purchased for cash in the amount of million and will require interior leasehold improvements ranging from 
table of contents to million 
we initially plan to use one floor  approximately  square feet 
the unoccupied space will be offered for lease to third parties until we need it to accommodate additional growth 
in november  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million over a two year period to repurchase shares of our common stock 
as of march   we had spent approximately million to purchase approximately million shares at an average price of per share 
under the terms of our senior secured credit facility  we are required to prepay indebtedness under the facility in an amount equal to of purchases of our common stock 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  working capital of million and total assets of  million 
indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility totaled million as of march  with additional borrowings available under this facility of million 
building mortgage indebtedness as of march  totaled million 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect capital expenditures for the next twelve months to approximate million 
if necessary  we may be required to increase capital expenditures to replace purchased bandwidth acquired from service providers who may be unable to provide an acceptable level of service 
current estimates of the cost to replace such potential lost capacity approximate million 
deferred tax asset during the year ended march   we filed a request for determination from the internal revenue service irs regarding the propriety of the establishment of an intangible asset  for tax purposes only  arising in connection with a september transaction with three stockholders in which we obtained access to the customers of aucs and cash of million in exchange for the issuance to the stockholders of million shares of our class b common stock 
in november we received a favorable determination from the irs that an intangible asset relating to the access to the aucs customers was created by the transaction 
the intangible asset  that will be amortized in our tax returns over a period of fifteen years  was determined to have a value of million 
accordingly in the year ended march   we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
staff accounting bulletin  transfer of nonmonetary assets by promoters or shareholders  requires that transfers of nonmonetary assets to a company by stockholders in exchange for stock prior to or at the time of a company s initial public offering be recorded at the transferor s historical cost basis 
accordingly  for financial statement purposes  the access to the aucs customers was valued at the stockholders basis of correspondingly  the credit resulting from the recognition of the deferred tax asset was reflected as an increase in stockholders equity  net of directly related costs 
at march   our net deferred tax assets totaled million which are principally comprised of the intangible asset discussed above 
we estimate that we must generate income taxable in the united states of million per year over the amortization and carryforward periods in order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets 
we believe that our future united states taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the full amount of the net deferred tax assets 
however  should our future united states taxable income be significantly less than our current expectations  we may record a valuation allowance equal to all or substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
recording such a valuation allowance would result in a charge to income tax expense and that charge could be material 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
over the past two years  rising prices for some of our supplies have been offset by decreasing prices for other services 
in particular  our per unit costs for leased lines and circuits has generally decreased over this period 
however  we cannot assure you that per unit costs for leased lines and circuits will continue to decline or that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which arise during the normal course of business from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
a discussion of our primary market risks associated with our foreign currency transactions  available for sale securities  and long term debt exposure is presented below 
foreign exchange risk we conduct our operations in more than countries and territories around the world in a number of different currencies 
there is exposure to future earnings when foreign exchange rates change and certain receivables  payables and intercompany transactions are denominated in foreign currencies 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currencies through our regular operating activities and have not historically used derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risk 
we invoice substantially all sales of our services to our country representatives and sales channel partners in us dollars 
however  many of our country representatives derive their revenues and incur costs in currencies other than us dollars 
to the extent that the local currency used by the country representative fluctuates against the us dollar  the obligations of the country representative may increase or decrease significantly and lead to foreign exchange losses or gains 
we assume the exchange rate risk for our consolidated country representatives  however  our non consolidated country representatives assume the exchange rate risk under our country representative structure 
our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily arises from outsourcing services and assignment agreements with aucs  which are denominated in euros as well as operating costs associated with such agreements 
approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended march  were generated 
table of contents from the euro denominated aucs agreements 
the revenues and the related costs result in a net euro exposure of the gross profit  which is equal to approximately of revenues 
the euro denominated gross profit offset by other euro denominated operating costs generally results in a natural hedge 
however  timing of settlement of euro denominated accounts receivables and payables subjects the company to exchange rate risk on settlement of the receivables and payables 
euro denominated cash  accounts receivable less accounts payable related to aucs agreements was a million net asset as of march  as of march   we were primarily exposed to the following currencies the euro  the british pound  the italian lire and the french franc 
based upon a hypothetical ten percent strengthening of the us dollar across all currencies  the potential losses in future earnings due to foreign currency exposures would have been approximately million as of that date 
interest rate risk we currently maintain an investment portfolio of high quality marketable securities 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable instruments including us treasury bills  obligations issued by government agencies  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  master notes  corporate notes and asset backed securities 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
all securities are classified as available for sale  and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
fluctuations in fair value attributable to changes in interest rates are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of march  are as follows carrying amount maturity thereafter fair value investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term investments weighted average interest rate long term debt secured bank notes average interest rate mortgage loan average interest rate the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of march  are as follows carrying amount maturity thereafter fair value investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term investments weighted average interest rate long term debt secured bank notes average interest rate mortgage loan average interest rate 
table of contents we have not historically used derivatives to hedge our interest rate risk 
however  under the terms of our senior secured credit facility entered into on august   we are required to enter into hedge agreements to provide that at least of the outstanding term loans are subject to fixed interest rates 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates and mitigate our interest rate risk 
in connection with the mortgage loan related to the purchase of our headquarters facility  we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate over the remaining life of the mortgage agreement and mitigate interest rate risk 
commercial contracts with related parties some of our country representatives are related parties where either we hold more than twenty but less than fifty percent ownership interest or a country representative is owned  directly or indirectly  by one of our stockholders 
in each such case  our agreement with the related party acting as our country representative is our standard services agreement 
additionally  we have alternate sales channel agreements with some of our stockholders that allow these stockholders to resell our services under their brand names or to package them with other services they provide to their customers 
these alternate sales channel agreements are generally under the same terms as alternate sales channel agreements we enter into with other communications providers 
finally  from time to time we lease transmission capacity from some of our stockholders where they are existing local carriers 
these leases are short term and at tariff rates in regulated markets and at standard market rates in unregulated markets
