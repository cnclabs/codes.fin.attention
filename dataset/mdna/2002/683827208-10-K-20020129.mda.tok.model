overview we are a leading manufacturer of a broad range of tight buffered fiber optic cables primarily for the local area network and premise markets  often referred to as the enterprise market 
our tight buffered fiber optic cables are well suited for use in short to moderate distance applications to connect metropolitan  access and enterprise networks 
our tight buffered fiber optic cables are derived from technology originally developed for military applications requiring rugged  flexible and compact fiber optic cables 
our tight buffered fiber optic cables can be used both indoors and outdoors  are easy and economical to install  provide a high degree of reliability and offer industry leading performance characteristics 
we have designed and implemented an efficient and automated manufacturing process based on proprietary technologies 
this enables us to produce high quality indoor outdoor tight buffered fiber optic cable rapidly and cost efficiently 
we sell our products through our sales force to original equipment manufacturers and to major distributors  regional distributors and various smaller distributors 
in fiscal years  and   and of our net sales were from sales to our distributors 
international net sales were  and in fiscal years  and substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
net sales consist of gross sales of products  less discounts  refunds and returns 
revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment or delivery to the customer and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  based on shipping terms 
in fiscal year  of our net sales were attributable to one major domestic distributor 
in fiscal years and  this same distributor accounted for and of our net sales  respectively 
subsequent to october   this distributor advised us that it will no longer stock our products as part of its regular product offering 
in fiscal years and  and of our net sales were attributable to a second major distributor 
this second distributor filed for protection from its creditors under bankruptcy laws in january as of october   we reserved and expensed approximately million for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable from this second distributor 
as of january   we wrote off that million reserve as well as expensed an additional  for a total expense of million for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable from this distributor over fiscal years and other than these two distributors  no single customer accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal years  or a significant percentage of the selling price of our fiber optic cable is based on the cost of raw materials used 
because single mode fiber is less expensive than multimode fiber  single mode fiber optic cables have a lower per unit selling price than comparable multimode fiber optic cables 
we believe that the metropolitan and access markets are predominantly users of single mode fiber optic cable  and that increasingly  single mode fiber is also being used for other short to moderate distance installations 
to the extent that our product mix shifts toward single mode cables whether or not as a result of a shift in our sales mix shifts toward the metropolitan and access markets  we will have to increase the volume of our sales to maintain our current level of net sales 
although we currently have excess capacity  increased volume may require us to expand our manufacturing capacity more rapidly 
cost of goods sold consists of the cost of materials  compensation costs  product warranty costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations 
the largest percentage of costs included in cost of goods sold is attributable to costs of materials which are variable as opposed to fixed costs 
as a result  cost of goods sold typically changes in proportion to increases and decreases in net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of the compensation costs for sales and marketing personnel  shipping costs  travel expenses  customer support expenses  trade show expenses  advertising  bad debt expense  the compensation cost for administration  finance and general management personnel  as well as legal and accounting fees 
other income expense  net consists primarily of realized and unrealized net gains losses on trading securities  interest income and interest expense 
in january  we began actively buying and selling shares in the nasdaq trust  which is designed to closely track the price and yield performance of the nasdaq stock index 
we utilized short term margin borrowings payable to an investment broker to finance our position in these trading securities 
our margin borrowings were collateralized by the trading securities and were subject to margin provisions  which could have resulted in the sale of some or all of  and on certain occasions did result in the sale of some of  the trading securities to meet margin calls 
our active trading in the nasdaq trust continued through may   the date of the last purchase of these shares 
on october   as part of a policy to invest future excess funds only in short term interest bearing investments  we sold all of our remaining investment in the nasdaq trust and paid off the outstanding margin borrowings 
our board of directors has adopted an investment objectives and guidelines policy  in which we state that we will make no additional cash investments in the above mentioned nasdaq trust or in stocks of other companies 
in addition  our investment objectives and guidelines policy states that any future investments will be in us dollar denominated  short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
for accounting purposes  we categorized our investment in the nasdaq trust as trading securities  and we recorded the investment on our balance sheet at fair value  which was based on quoted market prices 
purchases and sales of trading securities were recognized on a trade date basis  the date the order to buy or sell is executed 
net realized gains or losses were determined on the first in  first out cost method 
we marked our investment to market on each balance sheet date 
any decline in fair value was recorded as an unrealized loss  while any increase in fair value was recorded as an unrealized gain 
realized gains and losses and unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities were included in other income expense  net 
in fiscal year  we recognized realized net losses of million in connection with our securities trading activities in other expense  net 
in fiscal year  we incurred interest expense of  on the margin borrowings 
as of october   we held no trading securities in accordance with our current investment policy and had no outstanding margin borrowings 
in fiscal year  we recognized realized and unrealized net gains of  in other income  net and continued to hold approximately million of these trading securities as of october  the amount of net unrealized holding loss included in other income  net in fiscal year was  as of october   we had short term margin borrowings of million payable to an investment broker related to the trading securities 
we incurred interest expense of  on the margin borrowings in fiscal year results of operations the following table sets forth selected line items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended october  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expense  net income loss before income tax expense income tax expense net income loss net sales 
net sales increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this increase was attributable to record net sales during our first and second quarters of fiscal year  substantially offset by lower sales in the third and fourth quarters 
the decrease in net sales in the third and fourth quarters resulted from the impact of weak economic conditions on market demand  as the industries we serve reduced or delayed capital spending 
during fiscal year  a decrease in demand for cable containing multimode fiber which typically has a higher relative sales price was partially offset by an increase in demand for cable containing single mode fiber which typically has a lower relative sales price 
total fiber meters shipped increased from million fiber meters shipped in fiscal year  to million fiber meters shipped in fiscal year this net increase in fiber meters shipped was a result of a million decrease in multimode fiber meters shipped and a million increase in single mode fiber meters shipped 
cable containing multimode fiber is generally used for communications over shorter distances where the higher bandwidth capacity and the higher transmission equipment cost of single mode fiber is not required 
multimode fiber cable is often used in datacom applications 
cable containing single mode fiber is generally used for communications over longer distances and where higher bandwidth capacity is required 
single mode fiber cable is often used in telecom  catv and various internet applications 
net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was attributable to increased sales volume 
total fiber meters shipped increased from million during fiscal year to million shipped for the same period in this increase in fiber meters shipped was a result of a million increase in multimode fiber meters shipped and a million increase in single mode fiber meters shipped 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year gross margin  or gross profit as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to adjustments booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that increased cost of goods sold

selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this increase is partly attributable to various charges incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  including a  charge for an anticipated settlement with the equal opportunity commission eeoc for alleged prior discriminatory practices and related complaints on december  we reached an agreement with the eeoc as to the amount of a settlement  but it is subject to final documentation and judicial review and approval  a  charge to write off deferred costs related to the aborted securities offering previously anticipated during fiscal year  and a  charge for costs related to a business development project 
in addition  legal expenses for fiscal year totaled  compared to  in fiscal year also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were higher other professional fees 
bad debt expense for fiscal year totaled million  of which  related to an increase in the bad debt reserve in the fourth quarter and  related to one of our distributors that filed for protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy laws in january by comparison bad debt expense for fiscal year totaled million  of which million related to a specific reserve for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable from that same bankrupt distributor 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of an increase in bad debt expense of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million specific reserve for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable from one of our distributors that filed for protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy laws in january other factors that contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year include an increase in our sales force  the continued expansion of marketing efforts and an increase in legal fees associated with the eeoc litigation and related complaints that had been filed against us with the eeoc

income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year notwithstanding the loss before income taxes during fiscal year  we reported income tax expense in fiscal year rather than an income tax benefit  due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million relating to the capital loss carryforward generated by the sale of our trading securities during fiscal year as of october   this valuation allowance was established because we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate future taxable capital gains to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset related to the capital loss carryforward generated by our securities trading losses 
in addition  the capital loss carryforward may be limited due to certain stock ownership changes 
in order to fully realize this deferred tax asset  we would need to generate future taxable capital gains of approximately million prior to the expiration of the capital loss carryforward in income tax expense increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year our effective tax rate was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year fluctuations in our effective tax rates are due primarily to the amount and timing of the tax benefits related to our extraterritorial income exclusion and foreign sales corporation which exempts from federal income taxation a portion of the net profit realized from sales outside of the united states of products manufactured in the united states

the lawsuit seeks injunctive and other relief and damages in an unspecified amount 
on december   the parties reached an agreement as to the amount of a settlement subject to final documentation and judicial review and approval that affords both individual and class relief  without any admission of liability 
pursuant to this agreement  we will pay  upon entry of a consent decree by the court   on the first anniversary and  on the second anniversary of the consent decree to satisfy any gender and race class claims   to one individual specifically named in the complaint  and at least  for our planned diversity  recruitment  and human resource management programs over the term of the consent decree 
the company  mr 
robert kopstein  our former chairman  president  chief executive officer and majority shareholder  and various john does our officers and or directors during the class period were named as defendants in three class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the western district of virginia 
in each of the substantially similar suits  the plaintiffs purport to represent purchasers of our common stock during the period ranging from july  through october   and allege that we violated federal securities laws and made fraudulent and or negligent misrepresentations and or omissions 
the plaintiffs in each of these lawsuits seek compensatory and exemplary damages in an unspecified amount  as well as reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the causes of action  including attorneys fees and expert fees 
management intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits 
we may  however  incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against the lawsuits  regardless of their merit or outcome 
at this early stage in the lawsuits  management cannot make a reasonable estimate of the monetary amount of their resolution or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses  if any 
if we are unsuccessful in defending these lawsuits  we could be subject to damages that may be substantial and could have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we were named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking to compel us to authorize our transfer agent to transfer unregistered  restricted stock on our stock ledger 
the first suit was filed on october   by bear  stearns co 
inc and bear  stearns securities corporation collectively  bear stearns 
the second suit was filed on october   by ubs painewebber inc painewebber 
in each case the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief with respect to transfers of shares of unregistered  restricted common stock of optical cable corporation sold in the course of liquidating brokerage accounts or repossessed shares of our former chairman  president  chief executive officer and majority shareholder to cover personal loans to him 
each of the lawsuits contains a claim for damages caused by the alleged wrongful refusal by us to authorize the transfers in connection with the liquidation 
on october   the court in the bear stearns case entered an order directing us to authorize the stock transfers sought by bear stearns and imposing certain conditions on bear stearns in connection with such transfers 
in early november  we reached an agreement with painewebber pursuant to which we would authorize stock transfers in connection with the liquidation of unregistered  restricted stock held by painewebber upon the foreclosure of a brokerage account of the former officer 
neither of the cases has been dismissed  however  management believes that these suits will be resolved without any material liability 
management also believes that any claim that we improperly interfered with the sale or transfer of the unregistered  restricted shares is without merit 
in october  our board of directors authorized the initiation of a stock repurchase program whereby we could repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
from time to time  our board of directors increased the total dollar amount of the stock repurchase program  which was eventually increased to million 
through october   we had repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million under this stock repurchase program 
the repurchases were funded through operating cash flow and borrowings under our lines of credit 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our common stock in open market transactions at a total cost of million 
effective september   we ceased the repurchase of shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program 
under a loan agreement with our bank dated march   we had million secured revolving line of credit and a million secured revolving line of credit 
the lines of credit are subject to certain restrictive covenants 
during fiscal year  we violated certain restrictive covenants 
effective october   the bank waived our defaults under the loan agreement  amended the loan agreement and reduced the million line of credit to million for a maximum combined availability of million 
as of october   we had combined outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit in the amount of million  with million unused and available 
the lines of credit bear interest at above the monthly libor rate at october  and are equally and ratably collateralized by our accounts receivable  contract rights  inventory  furniture and fixtures  machinery and equipment and general intangibles 
the lines of credit will expire on march   unless they are further renewed or extended 
we are currently negotiating potential lines of credit of to million with a number of financial institutions  including our bank  to replace our current lines of credit 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  current cash balances  and the lines of credit we are working to put in place will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months

new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations 
the use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets would no longer be amortized  but rather be tested for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs indicating that the asset may be impaired 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  neither standard is expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  an entity would recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions  the fasb has enhanced management s ability to provide information that helps financial statement users to assess the effects of a disposal transaction on the ongoing operations of an entity 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is encouraged 
the provisions of sfas no 
generally are to be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
as of october   there are no other new accounting standards issued  but not yet adopted by us  which are expected to be applicable to our financial position  operating results or financial statement disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in transactions in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
as of october   our financial instruments were not exposed to significant market risk due to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity price risk
