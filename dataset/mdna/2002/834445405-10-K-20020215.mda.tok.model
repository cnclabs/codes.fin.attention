results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos cerebral oximeter  the only non invasive patient monitoring system commercially available in the united states that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen level in the brain 
we are also developing the correstore system for use in cardiac repair and reconstruction  including heart surgeries called surgical ventricular restoration  or svr 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we introduced our new model cerebral oximeter at an international trade show  and began international shipments of the model in august the model has the added capability of being able to monitor pediatric patients 
in september  we received clearance from the fda to market the model cerebral oximeter in the united states 
in june  we entered into a license agreement for the correstore system 
in november we received clearance from the fda to market the correstore patch in the united states 
during fiscal  and  our primary activities consisted of sales and marketing of the cerebral oximeter and related disposable somasensor 
we had an accumulated deficit of  through november  we derive our revenues from sales of cerebral oximeters and somasensors to our distributors and to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales employees and independent sales representatives 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our primary expenses  excluding the cost of our products  are selling  general and administrative and research  development and engineering 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in united states sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of the disposable somasensor and initial purchases of demonstration equipment by independent sales representatives  and a increase in the average selling price of somasensors primarily as a result of the increase from the prior year in the suggested retail price of the somasensor effective september   and a change in the sales mix between sales in the united states  which have higher average selling prices  and sales to international distributors  and a increase in the average selling price of cerebral oximeters  primarily as a result of a change in the sales mix between sales in the united states and sales to international distributors  and increased sales of the model cerebral oximeter in the united states in fiscal the increase in net revenues was achieved despite a decrease in international sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to stocking orders for model and model cerebral oximeters and somasensors by tyco healthcare ag  formerly nellcor puritan bennett export inc  in fiscal  and delays in marketing the cerebral oximeter in markets  including europe  in fiscal  and decreased purchases by baxter limited in japan in fiscal attributable to a change in product focus by edwards lifesciences corporation since being spun off by baxter international  inc baxter limited in japan is now part of edwards lifesciences corporation 
approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal sales of somasensors  model cerebral oximeters  model cerebral oximeters  and model exchanges as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors model cerebral oximeters model cerebral oximeters model exchanges total one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november   and two international distributors accounted for approximately and  respectively  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a increase in the average selling price of somasensors and a increase in the average selling price of cerebral oximeters described above  and increased sales of our latest model somasensor  launched in may  which is less costly to manufacture than the prior model somasensor 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a  increase in costs associated with the development of the correstore system 
this increase was partially offset by a  decrease in costs associated with the development of the latest model somasensor  and a  decrease in engineering salaries as a result of one less engineer 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  decrease in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of employees  principally sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november   a  decrease in travel and selling related expenses primarily related to reduced trade show and travel expenses as a result of the reduction in sales personnel  and reduced marketing expenses as a result of promotional materials  travel and training for tyco healthcare ag in fiscal  a  decrease in office related expenses primarily as a result of the reduced number of employees and our focus on cost containment  a  decrease in clinical research expenses  primarily related to the model cerebral oximeter  and a  decrease in incentive compensation expense primarily due to our executive officers not participating in the employee incentive compensation plan in exchange for a grant of stock options  these decreases were partially offset by  in commissions paid to our independent sales representatives engaged in fiscal  a  termination fee related to the kingsbridge capital limited private equity line  and a  increase in intangible amortization expense related to the amortization of license acquisition costs 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of marketing and selling the correstore system 
we realized a  loss on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in international sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to the stocking orders for model and model cerebral oximeters and somasensors by nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  and an increase in united states sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to increased purchases of the disposable somasensor 
the increase in net revenues was achieved despite decreased purchases of the model by baxter limited in japan attributable to the initial stocking purchases and exchange purchases made in fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we offered to exchange model cerebral oximeters for model a cerebral oximeters which we then scrapped and cash equal to the difference in sales prices of the two models to baxter limited in japan  as a result of the japanese ministry of health and welfare approval in the first quarter of fiscal to market the model in japan  a decrease in the average selling price of cerebral oximeters primarily as a result of the stocking orders from nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  at lower per unit prices  for use as demonstration equipment by its sales personnel  and a change in the sales mix in the united states between direct purchases of the model and no cap placements of the model during fiscal  we began a no cap sales program whereby we ship the model cerebral oximeter to the customer at no charge  in exchange for the customer agreeing to purchase at a premium a minimum monthly quantity of somasensors  and a decrease in the average selling price of somasensors primarily as a result of the initial stocking orders from nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  at lower per unit prices  for use as demonstration equipment by its sales personnel 
approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal sales of somasensors  model cerebral oximeters  model cerebral oximeters  and model exchanges as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors model cerebral oximeters model cerebral oximeters model exchanges total two international distributors accounted for approximately and  respectively  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november   and one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  although we realized a lower average selling price for cerebral oximeters and somasensors in fiscal  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to shipments of our new model somasensor in fiscal  which is less costly to manufacture than the old model somasensors 
the new model somasensor was sold for the entire year in fiscal  as compared to fiscal when it was launched and was sold primarily in the second half of the year 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a  decrease in consulting fees associated with the termination of our consulting order with neurophysics corporation  and a  decrease in costs associated with enhancements to the design of the disposable somasensor 
these decreases were achieved despite a  increase in costs associated with the development of the correstore system  and a  increase in engineering salaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  decrease in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of employees  principally sales and marketing  from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and reduced sales commissions  a  decrease in trade show expenditures during fiscal a  decrease in professional service fees primarily as a result of decreased business consulting fees during fiscal  and a  decrease in employee severance during fiscal these decreases were incurred despite a  increase in selling related expenses  primarily related to marketing and promotional materials  travel  and training related to our new distribution agreement with nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  and other employee travel expenses  a  increase in intangible amortization expense related to the amortization of license acquisition costs  and a  increase in clinical research expenses  primarily related to the model cerebral oximeter 
we realized a  loss on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations during fiscal was approximately  cash was used primarily to fund our net loss  including selling  general and administrative expenses and research  development and engineering expenses  totaling approximately  before depreciation and amortization expense  increase inventory by approximately  primarily due to the purchase of components related to our new generation somasensor  decrease accrued liabilities by approximately  and accounts payable by  primarily as a result of payments made in fiscal these uses of cash were partially offset by an  decrease in accounts receivable  primarily as a result of more timely collections in fiscal we expect to increase our inventory in fiscal  as a result of our fourth quarter sales  and our expected sales of the cerebral oximeter  somasensor and correstore system in fiscal we expect our working capital requirements to increase if sales increase 
we capitalized approximately  of costs for model and model cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration units and no cap units during fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal we expect to depreciate these costs over three years 
capital expenditures in fiscal were approximately  these expenditures were primarily for the costs for model and model demonstration and no cap cerebral oximeters described above  and for approximately  in tooling costs associated with our new model somasensor 
we expect our capital requirements to increase as a result of the costs of developing and marketing the correstore system 
our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity investments from sales of our common shares 
see statements of shareholders equity of our financial statements included in item of this report 
on march   we entered into the private equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited  a private institutional investor 
we completed the sales of  common shares under the private equity line agreement  for gross proceeds of  our net proceeds  after deducting the commissions and the estimated expenses of the offerings  were approximately  effective march   we de registered the remaining shares originally registered for resale by kingsbridge under the private equity line agreement  because we no longer intend to sell any more shares to kingsbridge  except upon any exercise of its warrant  and kingsbridge is no longer publicly offering for resale the shares subject to the warrant we granted to them 
on april   we mutually agreed with kingsbridge to terminate the private equity line agreement  the related registration rights agreement  and kingsbridge s right to the discount on any unsold shares  in exchange for our payment of  to kingsbridge 
on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement with crestmark bank for a working capital line of credit for up to  collateralized by all of our assets 
under the agreement  crestmark bank may  but is not obligated to  lend us amounts we request from time to time  up to  if no default exists 
the loans are limited by a borrowing base based on qualifying accounts receivable and lender reserves 
the loan is payable on demand  and collections of our receivables are directed to crestmark bank in payment of any outstanding balance of the loan 
the principal amount outstanding bears interest  payable monthly  at the prime rate at february  plus plus a service fee  and we paid a  commitment fee for the loan 
through november   we have borrowed an aggregate of  under the agreement and repaid  in principal amount through crestmark s collection of our receivables and by using some of the proceeds from our april  offering 
as of november    was available for borrowing  at crestmark s discretion  under the facility 
we have agreed to use the proceeds of the loans solely as working capital 
the line of credit requires us to maintain minimum tangible net worth of  and a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth not to exceed the line of credit terminates upon crestmark s demand 
on april   we completed the private placement of  newly issued common shares at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  our estimated net proceeds  after deducting the placement agent s commission and the expenses of the offering  were approximately  brean murray co  inc was our exclusive placement agent for the offering and received for its services  as a placement agent fee  and warrants to purchase  common shares at per share exercisable during the four year period beginning april  a 
brean murray  one of our directors  and his wife control brean murray co  inc in addition  the brean murray co  inc profit sharing plan purchased  common shares in the offering  and robert r 
henry  one of our directors  purchased  common shares in the offering 
as of november   we had working capital of  cash and cash equivalents of  total current liabilities of  and shareholders equity of  from december  through february   we have borrowed  under the loan and security agreement with crestmark bank 
we have repaid  in principal amount under the agreement through crestmark s collection of our receivables  and have repaid  in principal amount under the agreement from the proceeds of our january  offering described below 
as of february   we had no outstanding principal loan balance  and  was available for borrowing  at crestmark s discretion  under the facility 
on january   we completed the public offering of  newly issued common shares at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  our estimated net proceeds  after deducting the placement agent s commission and the estimated expenses of the offering  were approximately  brean murray co  inc was our exclusive placement agent for the offering and received for its services  as a placement agent fee  and warrants to purchase  common shares at per share exercisable during the four year period beginning january  a 
brean murray  one of our directors  and his wife control brean murray co  inc we expect that our primary needs for liquidity in fiscal will be to fund our losses and sustain our operations  including funding marketing costs for the cerebral oximeter and the correstore system  and research and development efforts related to product line extensions of the cerebral oximeter for use on newborns  other non brain tissue applications  and enhancements to the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  and for working capital  including increased accounts receivable and inventories of components and sales units to satisfy expected sales orders 
in addition  we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily for new demonstration and no cap equipment and manufacturing tooling for the cerebral oximeter  somasensor  and correstore system 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at november   together with the net proceeds of our public offering of  common shares that closed on january  described above and the estimated net borrowings available under the crestmark bank loan and security agreement described above  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for more than the next twelve months 
the estimated length of time current cash  cash equivalents and available borrowings will sustain our operations is based on estimates and assumptions we have made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to change as a result of actual experience 
actual capital requirements necessary to market the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  to develop and market the correstore system  to undertake other product development activities  and for working capital might be substantially greater than current estimates 
our ability to use our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income  if any  for income tax purposes  is limited due to the initial public offering of our securities in march see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report
