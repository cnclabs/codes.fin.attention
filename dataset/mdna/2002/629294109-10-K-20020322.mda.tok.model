item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about the company and our industry 
these forward looking statements are usually accompanied by words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in this section under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
overview since its inception in  the company has focused its efforts on the design  development and commercialization of medical technologies that are delivered by minimally invasive  catheter based procedures 
the company s product are designed to offer alternative approaches to existing complex treatments  thereby reducing patient trauma  shortening procedure  hospitalization and recovery times  and lowering overall treatment costs 
the company s initial product  a vena cava filter system  received fda clearance in from may the snf filter products were distributed in the united states and certain other countries by bard radiology and from november in other markets outside the united states by bard international 
on november  the company sold the vena cava filter product line to bard pursuant to an asset purchase agreement 
in exchange for these assets  the company received million at closing and million in january and will receive up to an additional million tied to certain performance and delivery milestones 
in addition  commencing upon various milestone dates  as defined  the company will receive ongoing royalty payments from bard on its sales of the vena cava filter products 
the company will continue to manufacture the products for bard for an interim period of time  but no later than december   pursuant to the agreement 
from the initial sale proceeds  the company repaid in full the remaining million face amount of its subordinated note 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with boston scientific pursuant to which boston scientific obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  market and distribute the company s stent technology and products which incorporate such technology 
under this license agreement  boston scientific is responsible for performing clinical trials for stents under development and for reimbursing the company for any stent development costs incurred by the company 
the company earns royalties  based upon product sales  and certain manufacturing cost reduction incentives from boston scientific under the license agreement  which are included in the company s revenues 
in february  the company acquired the rights to develop and commercialize its cardiac septal repair devices 
the company commenced sales of the cardioseal r septal occluder at the end of september in connection with clinical trials of the device  and the device has been sold commercially in europe and other international markets since july since september  the fda has granted approval for use of the cardioseal r product under hde regulations for three indications 
in december  the company received a pma from the fda allowing commercial sales of the cardioseal r cardiac septal repair implant in the united states for patients with vsd that are not candidates for surgical closure 
the company manufactures the cardioseal r products at its facility in boston 
vena cava filters  stents and cardiac septal repair devices collectively comprise the company s cardiovascular business unit 
in july  the company acquired the neurosurgical instruments business of elekta ab publ for approximately million in cash and has operated the business as the company s neurosciences business unit 
in april  following a decision by the company s board of directors to discontinue the uk operations of its neurosciences business unit  the company sold certain assets of that division  including the selector r ultrasonic aspirator and ruggles tm surgical instruments products 
this sale reflected the company s strategic decision to refocus its efforts on its core septal repair  filter and stent products 
the company incurred significant operating losses in each of the years ended december  and in addition  in december  the company amended its subordinated note agreement to modify certain debt covenants  for which it had been in default  and agreed to repay  of the note in april as a result  the primary focus of the company s new senior management team in was cost containment and stabilization of its cardiovascular and neurosciences business units 
the cost containment efforts resulted in reduced levels of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the increased focus on the cardioseal r market opportunity  combined with the company s strengthened financial position at december  resulting from proceeds of the sale of its vena cava filter product line to bard  will provide the company with greater flexibility to further invest in research and development  regulatory affairs and sales and marketing infrastructure and programs 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  nmt s management uses its judgment in making certain assumptions and estimates 
our critical accounting policies include 
revenue recognition nmt recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by staff accounting bulletins a and b 
these bulletins require that four basic criteria must be satisfied before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between nmt and a third party exists  title to the product has transferred to the customer and nmt has no significant post delivery obligations  the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly no 
relating to the collectability of the receivables relating to such sales 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any period could be adversely affected 
nmt recognizes license fees and royalties as they are earned in accordance with relevant contractual provisions 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information relating to our accounting for vena cava filter product revenues under our transitional manufacturing agreement with bard 

inventories nmt states its inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
nmt records reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based on its historical experience and current product demand 
nmt evaluates the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 

impairment of long lived assets nmt reviews the carrying value of long lived assets periodically  based upon the expected future and discounted operating cash flows of its individual business units 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the timing and size of impairment charges involves the application of management s judgment and could significantly affect our operating results 

legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  which we discuss in note to our consolidated financial statements  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by the company in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  product sales increased to million compared to million 
an approximate million increase in cardioseal r septal occluder product sales was partially offset by an approximate  decrease in vena cava filter product sales and an approximate million decrease in product sales from the neurosciences business unit 
the company anticipates continued growth of cardioseal r product sales in and reduced vena cava filter product sales from its interim manufacturing agreement with bard 
license fees and royalties for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  these revenues relate to the exclusive license of the company s stent technology by boston scientific corporation and included  and  of royalties and  and  of cost sharing payments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  decrease in royalty payments is attributable to reduced boston scientific sales of the stent products manufactured using the company s technology 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales increased by or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  cost of product sales  as a percent of product sales  decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of product sales as a percent of product sales in is primarily attributable to a continued shifting of the product sales mix in favor of the company s cardioseal r septal occluders  which have a lower product cost as a percent of sales than the company s other product lines 
included in cost of product sales are royalty expenses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to acquired technologies and technology rights associated with various of the company s products 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased by  or to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced headcount and outside consulting services and lower contract management  clinical monitoring  data management and biostatisical analysis in support of the fda approval process for various medical use applications of the cardioseal r and starflex tm products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased by  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced headcount and lower depreciation costs resulting from the asset impairment during in the neurosciences business unit  partially offset by increased legal fees associated with ongoing litigation and general corporate matters 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by  or to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to a shift from a direct sales force to manufacturer representatives in the us operations of the neurosciences business unit  partially offset by increased sales commissions and marketing program costs in support of worldwide growth opportunities for the cardioseal r product line 
impairment of long lived assets 
the neurosciences business unit incurred substantial operating losses for the years ended december  and  which has caused management and the board of directors of the company to periodically consider various strategic alternatives for that unit 
in the second quarter of  based upon these historical operating losses  an undiscounted cash flow analysis and other considerations  the company recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets of the neurosciences business unit to their estimated fair value 
the long lived assets consist primarily of a building and other fixed assets located in the company s biot  france facility 
the year impairment charge followed a million impairment charge for the year ended december  for goodwill recorded upon the acquisition of the neurosciences business unit in july the company believes there has been no further impairment of long lived assets as of december  settlement of litigation 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a charge of  associated with the settlement  consummated in february  of litigation between sodem diffusion sa sodem and nmt neurosciences implants france sa nmt france  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of product line 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a gain on sale of product line of approximately million resulting from the sale of the assets comprising its vena cava filter product line to bard on november  in exchange for these assets  the company received million at closing and million in january and will receive up to an additional million tied to certain company performance and delivery milestones 
the company will continue to manufacture the product for bard for an interim period of time  but no later than december   as defined in the agreement 
the gain consists of proceeds of million less costs of approximately million  which consist of the purchase of royalty and other technology rights from beth israel  deferred revenue estimates related to the transitional manufacturing agreement  accruals for ongoing arbitration proceedings  the net book value of assets sold and legal and other costs of the sale 
currency transaction gain loss 
the company incurred currency transaction losses of approximately  for the year ended december  compared to currency transaction gains of approximately  for the year ended december  the net change of approximately  is primarily attributable to a  currency gain in the year ended december  related to the repayment of the euro denominated portion of the company s senior debt 
gain on sale of investment in image technologies corporation 
during the year ended december   the company sold its investment in image technologies corporation for  cash proceeds plus assumption of the company s position as guarantor of certain itc liabilities see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by  or to approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to a the repayments of million and  of the senior secured debt and the subordinated note  respectively  on april  in connection with the sale of the u 
k operations of the company s neurosciences business unit  b the repayments of the subordinated note by  and  in january and april  respectively  and c the payment in full of the remaining balance of the subordinated note of million in november in connection with the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard see notes   a and b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the net reduction of approximately million of interest bearing debt obligations during the year ended december  will likely result in a substantial reduction of interest expense in interest income 
interest income was approximately  for each of the years ended december  and this is primarily attributable to increases in interest bearing deposits resulting from the net proceeds from the sale of the uk operations of the neurosciences business unit in april and the sale of the vena cava filter product line in november  substantially offset by a significant reduction in interest rates from to the net cash proceeds from the sale of the vena cava filter product line will likely result in an increase in interest income in income tax provision 
the company s income tax provision in of  or approximately of income before income taxes  is less than what would be expected using the federal statutory federal tax rate of  primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
there was no income tax provision in due to losses incurred 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the extraordinary loss on early extinguishments of debt of approximately  net of income tax benefit  consists of the write off of remaining balances of original issue discount and deferred loan costs in connection with the repayment in full of the company s subordinated note in november gain loss on sale of discontinued operations 
there were no discontinued operations during for the year ended december   net gain from discontinued operations was  and consisted of a revision of estimates made concerning the costs associated with the sale of the uk operations in april see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  product sales increased to million compared to million 
an approximately million increase in cardioseal r septal occluder product sales was partially offset by an approximately million decrease in product sales from the neurosciences business unit 
license fees and royalties for the year ended december  decreased to  from million for the year ended december  these revenues relate primarily to the exclusive license of the company s stent technology by boston scientific corporation and included  and million of royalties and  and  of cost sharing payments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  decrease in royalty payments is attributable to the elimination of quarterly guaranteed minimums of  as of december  additionally  for the year ended december  the company s neurosciences business unit received patent license payments of approximately  cost of product sales 
cost of product sales decreased by  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of product sales  as a percent of product sales  decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of product sales as a percent of product sales in is primarily attributable to a shifting sales mix in favor of the company s cardioseal r septal occluders which have a lower product cost as a percent of sales than the company s other product lines 
research and development 
research and development expense increased by  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to contract management  clinical monitoring  data management and biostatisical analysis in support of the fda approval process for various medical use applications of the cardioseal r and starflex tm products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to a significant increase in legal fees associated with ongoing litigation and general corporate matters 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the development of a direct sales force for the cardioseal r products in the united states and europe 
impairment of long lived assets 
the neurosciences business unit continued to incur operating losses for the year ended december   which has caused management and the board of directors of the company to periodically consider various strategic alternatives for that unit 
in the second quarter  based upon these considerations  an undiscounted cash flow analysis and other considerations  the company recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets of the neurosciences business unit to their estimated fair value 
the long lived assets consist primarily of a building and other fixed assets located in the company s biot  france facility 
the current year impairment charge follows a million impairment charge for the year ended december  for goodwill recorded upon the acquisition of neurosciences business unit in july settlement of litigation 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a charge of  associated with the settlement  after year end  of litigation between sodem diffusion sa sodem and nmt neurosciences implants france sa nmt france  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of investment in image technologies corporation 
during the year ended december   the company sold its investment in image technologies corporation for  cash proceeds plus assumption of the company s position as guarantor of certain itc liabilities see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense

k operations of the company s neurosciences business unit see note a and b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased by to  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the use of million of cash to repay a portion of the subordinated note in september income tax provision 
the company did not record an income tax provision in due to its net operating loss position 
the provision for income taxes in of  is comprised of foreign income taxes 
gain loss on sale of discontinued operations 
net gain from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss in represented a million loss on the sale of the uk operations of the company s neurosciences business unit  partially offset by  of income from the discontinued operations 
the gain from discontinued operations in represents a revision of estimates made concerning the costs associated with the sale of the uk operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  as compared to million at december  the company received an additional million from bard on january  in connection with the sale of the vena cava filter product line 
for the year ended december   the company s operations provided cash of approximately million  which consisted of approximately million of cash provided by operations  approximately million of noncash charges and million of deferred income taxes  reduced by a million net increase in working capital items 
during the year ended december   the company has not engaged in 
material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or specific purpose entities  
trading activities in non exchange traded contracts  or 
transactions with persons or entities that benefit from their non independent relationship with the company in july  the company financed a portion of the acquisition of the neurosurgical instruments business with million of the company s cash and a million subordinated note issued to an affiliate of a significant stockholder of the company 
the subordinated note was due september   with quarterly interest payable at per annum 
on september   the company entered into a million senior secured debt facility with a bank  million of the proceeds of which was used to reduce the principal amount of the million subordinated note 
the company also used million of its own cash to further reduce the principal amount of the million subordinated note 
the remaining million of the senior secured debt facility was available to be drawn down by the company for working capital purposes 
the facility had a term of three years with interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate on us borrowings and an equivalent market rate on foreign currency borrowings 
in april  the company used the proceeds from the sale of the uk operations and certain other assets of the neurosciences business unit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements to reduce the subordinated note payable by  and to repay the entire senior secured debt balance of million 
in september  the working capital portion of the senior secured debt facility was terminated by the bank 
during the year ended december   the company repaid in full the million remaining balance of its subordinated debt through payments of a  in january from the proceeds obtained in connection with the sale of the company s investment in itc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  b  in april in connection with an amended debt covenants agreement executed in december  and c million in november in connection with the sale of its vena cava filter product line to bard see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchases of property and equipment for use in the company s manufacturing  research and development and general and administrative activities amounted to approximately  for the year ended december  at december   the company had remaining capital lease obligations of approximately  in connection with financing of prior years purchases of property  plant and equipment  of which approximately  will be repaid during and the remaining  will be repaid during the company is party to various contractual arrangements  including royalty arrangements and employment and consulting agreements 
minimum guaranteed royalty payments for are approximately  the company also had committed to purchase certain minimum quantities of the vena cava filter component from lake region through june  which agreement has been extended in connection with the interim manufacturing agreement with bard 
as of december  approximately  of purchase commitments are outstanding  all of which have been purchased through february see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes estimated outstanding future contractual commitments of the company at december  amounts due in less than after total one year years years years capital lease obligations    operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations   all of these arrangements require cash payments by the company over varying periods of time 
certain of these arrangements are cancelable on short notice and certain require termination or severance payments as part of any early termination 
the company may require additional funds for its research and product development programs  regulatory processes  preclinical and clinical testing  sales and marketing infrastructure and programs and potential licenses and acquisitions 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the sales of its products  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in the company s existing research  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any collaborative  licensing and other similar arrangements that the company may establish 
the company believes that existing cash and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital  financing and capital expenditure requirements through at least euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their national currency unit and irrevocably established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
beginning on january   euro banknotes and coins have been introduced  and legacy currency banknotes and coins will be withdrawn from circulation at the end of february the company conducts a substantial portion of its business within the member countries of the european union  and accordingly its existing systems are generally capable of accommodating multiple currencies  including the euro 
the neurosciences business unit  headquartered in france  converted its accounting systems to euro prior to december  as of december   the impact of the euro conversion has not had a material impact on the operations of the company 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we may face challenges in executing our focused business strategy 
in connection with the commercialization of our cardioseal r product  and the recent sales of a portion of our neurosciences business unit and our vena cava filter product line  we have focused our business growth strategy to concentrate on the manufacturing  marketing and selling of our cardioseal r cardiac septal repair devices 
our future sales growth and financial results are highly dependent upon the growth of sales of this product line 
cardioseal r product sales may not grow as quickly as we expect for various reasons  including  but not limited to  delays in receiving further fda approvals  difficulties in recruiting additional experienced sales and marketing personnel and increased competition 
this focus has placed significant demands on a relatively new senior management team and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage and implement our focused business strategy effectively  including by 
improving our sales and marketing capabilities  
continuing to train  motivate and manage our employees  and 
developing and improving our operational  financial and other internal systems 
we may face uncertainties with respect to commercialization  product development and market acceptance of our products 
before certain of our products can be marketed and sold in the united states  including our cardioseal r product  we may be required to conduct further research  product development  preclinical and clinical testing and obtain additional governmental regulatory approvals 
we cannot be certain that our current products  or products currently under development  will achieve or continue to have market acceptance 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by surgery  drugs or other medical devices 
currently  the medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments  and these other treatments have a long history of use 
we cannot be certain that our devices and procedures will be able to replace such established treatments or that either physicians or the medical community  in general  will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop additional products 
even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits  the cost of commercializing that product candidate may be too high to justify development 
in addition  competitors may develop products that are more effective  cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products 
if we are unable to develop additional  commercially viable products  our future prospects will be limited 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may face intellectual property infringement claims 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be certain that 
any pending patent applications or any future patent application will result in issued patents  
the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us  
any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or 
others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by us 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that others have not or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of our products or design around any patents issued or that may be issued in the future to us or to our licensors 
whether or not patents are issued to us or to our licensors  others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by us 
we could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our issued us patents  and corresponding foreign patents  expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent 
our limited manufacturing history and the possibility of non compliance with manufacturing regulations raise uncertainties with respect to our ability to commercialize future products 
we have a limited history in manufacturing our products  including our cardioseal r cardiac septal repair devices  and we may face difficulties as the commercialization of our products and the medical device industry changes 
increases in our manufacturing costs  or significant delays in our manufacturing process  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards including  but not limited to  good manufacturing practice and iso these regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production or purchasing costs and may even prevent us from making or obtaining our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we  or a third party manufacturer  change our approved manufacturing process  the fda will require a new approval before that process could be used 
failure to develop our manufacturing capabilities may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably  as a result of delays and additional capital investment costs 
we may be unable to successfully market our products due to limited marketing and sales experience 
our neurosurgical implants and cardiac septal repair devices are marketed through our direct sales force and distributors 
because we have marketed our initial products such as stents and vena cava filters through third parties  we have limited experience marketing our products directly 
in order to market directly the cardioseal r septal occluder and any related products  we will have to continue to develop a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to compete successfully because of intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
existing and future products  therapies  technological approaches and delivery systems will continue to compete directly with our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  greater research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and experience and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  new surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current or future procedures that utilize our products 
as a result  any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with development of these products 
an adverse outcome in any litigation we are currently involved in could affect our financial condition we are currently involved in the litigation of several disputes as described in item legal proceedings 
an adverse outcome in any one of these disputes could result in substantial monetary damages and  therefore  negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
product liability claims  product recalls and uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the testing  marketing and sale of implantable devices and materials carry an inherent risk that users will assert product liability claims against us or our third party distributors 
in these lawsuits  users might allege that their use of our devices had adverse effects on their health 
a product liability claim or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our devices are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
although we currently maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that in the future we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms  or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will avoid significant product liability claims and the attendant adverse publicity 
any product liability claim  or other claim  with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
intense industry competition for qualified employees could affect our ability to attract and retain necessary  qualified personnel 
in the medical device field  there is intense competition for qualified personnel and we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
both the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would be detrimental to our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as marketing 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business 
as a result of government regulations  we may experience lower sales and earnings 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices intended for commercial distribution are subject to extensive governmental regulations in the united states 
medical devices generally require pre market clearance or pre market approval prior to commercial distribution 
certain material changes or modifications to medical devices are also subject to regulatory review and clearance or approval 
the regulatory approval process is expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
in addition  any products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the fda 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis or at all 
the occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  regulatory approvals or clearances  
the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  
limitations on the intended use of a device imposed as a condition of regulatory approvals or clearances  or 
our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
in addition  sales of medical device products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face uncertainties with respect to the availability of third party reimbursement 
in the united states  medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as private insurance reimbursement programs  greatly affect revenues for suppliers of health care products and services 
such third party payors may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount  if any  of reimbursement which they provide to the physicians and clinics using our devices  or any other products that we may develop 
if  for any reason  the third party payors decided not to provide reimbursement for our products  this would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
moreover  mounting concerns about rising health care costs may cause the government or private insurers to implement more restrictive coverage and reimbursement policies in the future 
in the international market  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers and by governmental insurers and providers varies from country to country 
in certain countries  our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party governmental reimbursement 
the significant concentration of ownership of our common stock could limit investors ability to influence corporate actions 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control of the company  could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the company and might affect the market price of our common stock 
whitney co 
and related entities own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  this stockholder is able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
the company s investments are primarily short term money market accounts that are carried on the company s books at cost  which approximates fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
the company is subject to market risk in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk
