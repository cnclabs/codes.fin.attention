item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction and critical accounting policies we are an independent energy company with activities concentrated within the oil and gas industry 
in poland  we have projects involving the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas with pogc and apache 
in the united states  we produce oil from fields in montana and nevada and have an oilfield services company in northern montana that performs contract drilling and well servicing operations 
we conduct substantially all of our exploration and development activities in poland jointly with others and  accordingly  recorded amounts for our activities in poland reflect only our proportionate interest in these activities 
our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year based on the factors discussed in risk factors and on other factors such as our exploratory and development drilling success 
therefore  the results of any one year may not be indicative of future results 
oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties in both the united states and poland 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are considered not to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net revenues determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of fx energy s oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense and impairment expense  and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas properties 
depreciation rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of oil or gas produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
also  estimated reserves are often used to calculate future cash flows from our oil and gas operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production segment  or e p  and the oilfield services segment 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation g a  interest income  other income  interest expense  impairment of notes receivable from officers and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
a comparison of the results of operations by business segment and the information regarding nonsegmented items for the years ended december   and  respectively follows 
exploration and production segment a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil and gas revenues  average oil and gas prices  oil and gas production volumes and lifting costs per barrel and mcf for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  oil gas oil gas oil gas revenues     percent change versus prior year 
average price bbls or mcf percent change versus prior year 
production volumes bbls or mcf     percent change versus prior year 
lifting costs per bbls or mcf 
percent change versus prior year 
the contract price for gas during prior to adjusting for actual physical content of british thermal units  or btu  was per mmbtu 
lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced after royalties 
lifting costs per mcf of gas are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total mcf of gas produced before royalties 
lifting costs do not include production taxes 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we received  of oil revenues from poland pertaining to the production test performed on the wilga all other oil revenues for  and were derived solely from our producing properties in the united states 
during these three years  the oil revenues from our united states producing properties fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices  the degree of maintenance performed and the declining production rates attributable to the natural production declines of our producing properties 
gas revenues 
our gas revenues are derived solely from our polish producing operations 
gas revenues were  during the year ended december  there were no gas revenues during and the kleka  our first producing well in poland  began producing during february during  gas produced by the kleka was sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing under a five year contract  which may be terminated by giving pogc a day written notice 
also  during  there were no gas revenues pertaining to the wilga or the tuchola  as the gas produced during the production tests for each of the wells was flared 
the wilga and the tuchola are currently shut in  pending the construction of pipelines and production facilities 
lease operating costs 
our lease operating costs consist of normal recurring lease operating expenses and production taxes 
lease operating costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and  respectively  per barrel of oil produced and per mcf of gas produced during the year ended december  lease operating expenses  or loe  were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
loe incurred during include  or per mcf of gas produced based on a working interest  pertaining solely to the kleka well that began producing in poland during february there were no loe associated with poland during and during  in the united states  we plugged and abandoned ten inactive wells on the cut bank sand unit  our principal producing property in montana  at a total cost of approximately  during  in the united states  we plugged and abandoned ten inactive wells on the cut bank sand unit at a total cost of approximately  during  in the united states  we performed only routine maintenance on our producing properties and deferred workovers in an effort to control operating costs due to the low oil prices that prevailed throughout most of production taxes are solely attributable to our united states oil production 
production taxes were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
production tax legislation in the state of montana  as revised during  contains provisions whereby the production tax rate for stripper wells was decreased to be as low as coupled with provisions that would increase the production tax rate to as high as for an entire calendar quarter in the event west texas intermediate crude oil  or wti  exceeded per barrel for an entire quarter 
during  and  wti exceeded only during the third and fourth quarters of as a result  production taxes were substantially higher during as compared to and production taxes averaged approximately  and of oil revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
dd a expense incurred during includes approximately  or per mcf of gas produced  associated solely with the kleka well that began producing in poland during february the capital costs pertaining to the kleka that were included in the dd a calculation for the year ended december   include our share of costs and pogc s share of costs  which we paid as part of our commitment to earn a working interest in the fences project area 
there was no dd a expense associated with poland during and the dd a rate per barrel for oil produced in the united states was  and during  and  respectively 
the differences between the dd a rates per barrel from year to year are primarily the result of changes in oil reserve estimates computed as of december   and  respectively 
poland agreement credit 
under an amendment to the apache exploration program effective january   referred to as the poland agreement  apache agreed to issue us a credit that included apache covering  of our share of joint costs in poland other than carried costs in return for the release of apache s commitment to cover our share of costs to shoot kilometers of d seismic data in the carpathian project area 
during and  we utilized the entire poland agreement credit  as shown below poland agreement credit total cost category geological and geophysical costs    exploratory dry hole costs    apache poland general and administrative costs    leasehold costs   tuchola completion costs   total    exploration costs 
our exploration costs consist of geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  exploratory dry holes and nonproducing leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we incurred g g costs totaling  relating to our discontinued gold exploration in poland  all of which is excluded from the following discussion of each component of exploration costs because mining is not a reportable segment 
g g costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we spent approximately million on acquiring d seismic data in the fences project area   acquiring and analyzing d seismic data on the pomeranian project area and granted options valued at  to a polish consultant 
during  we spent approximately million on acquiring d seismic data in the fences project area  approximately  on acquiring and analyzing d seismic data on the lublin basin  pomeranian and warsaw west project areas and granted stock options valued at approximately  to a polish consultant 
under terms of the poland agreement credit  apache covered our share of additional g g costs totaling  and  during and  respectively 
during  we spent approximately  reprocessing d seismic data on the pomeranian and warsaw west project areas  granted stock options valued at approximately  to a polish consultant and spent approximately  evaluating potential property acquisitions from pogc 
from january   through december   we spent an average amount of approximately million annually relating to analyzing seismic data and the wages and associated expenses for employees and consultants directly engaged in geological and geophysical activities 
subject to available funding  g g costs are expected to continue at current or higher levels as we further our exploratory efforts in poland 
exploratory dry hole costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we incurred costs of million pertaining to the mieszkow on the fences project area 
in accordance with fasb no 
 we have classified the mieszkow as an exploratory dry hole for financial reporting purposes  because drilling operations have been suspended since april pending the reprocessing and interpretation of d seismic data in order to evaluate the continuation of drilling operations and the need for additional funding 
during  we drilled the wilga and wilga wells near our wilga discovery on the wilga project area  both of which were subsequently determined to be exploratory dry holes costing a net amount of million and  respectively  after apache covered one half of our share of drilling costs under terms of the apache exploration program 
during  we participated in drilling three exploratory dry holes in poland 
two of these wells  the siedliska and witkow  were carried exploratory wells under the apache exploration program 
as such  apache covered all of our pro rata share of drilling costs for both wells 
we paid  for a interest in the andrychow well  an exploratory dry hole on the carpathian project area 
on the lachowice farm in  we spent  to recomplete one shut in well and test another shut in well  both of which were noncommercial 
also  during  we spent  associated with the gladysze a  an exploratory dry hole drilled on the baltic project area during under terms of the poland agreement credit  apache covered  of additional exploratory costs incurred by us during and  including  for the wilga   for the wilga and  for the lachowice nonproducing leasehold impairments were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we incurred nonproducing leasehold impairments of  for the baltic project area and  for the warsaw west project area  both of which are located in poland in areas where we no longer have exploration plans 
during  we incurred a nonproducing leasehold impairment  for the williston basin in north dakota  where we also no longer have exploration plans 
during  we incurred a nonproducing leasehold impairment of  for the lachowice farm in  which was deemed noncommercial after recompleting a shut in well and testing another shut in well yielded noncommercial results  and  pertaining to a prospect in nevada where we also no longer have exploration plans 
nonproducing leasehold impairments will vary from period to period based on our determination that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not realizable 
apache poland g a costs 
apache poland g a costs consist of our share of direct overhead costs incurred by apache in poland in accordance with the terms of the apache exploration program 
apache poland g a costs were  and  for the years ended december  and there were no apache poland g a costs during the year ended december  during mid  we began to narrow the focus of our ongoing exploratory efforts relating to the apache exploration program by including only the pomeranian and wilga project areas and discontinued our exploratory activities on the lublin basin  warsaw west and carpathian project areas 
prior to july   apache covered all of our pro rata share of apache poland g a costs 
effective july   we began paying approximately of apache poland g a costs  to be adjusted as each of apache s remaining drilling requirements are completed  up to a maximum of 
apache has since completed its remaining drilling requirements  and we are now responsible for our entire share of apache poland g a costs relating to ongoing  jointly conducted activities in poland for which apache is the operator  subject to a preapproved annual budget 
in addition to the above amounts  apache covered our share of additional apache poland g a costs totaling  and  during and  respectively  under terms of the poland agreement credit 
other income e p 
other income for our e p segment was  during the year ended december  there was no other income for our e p segment during and during  we sold the working interest in our nonproducing ryckman creek prospect located in wyoming for  for which we had associated costs of  oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during each year from through  oilfield services revenues increased each year due to improved market conditions and an increasing emphasis on utilizing the company s oilfield servicing equipment for contract third party services rather than servicing company owned properties 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on utilizing our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties and other factors 
oilfield servicing costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
oilfield services costs as a percentage of oilfield services revenues were relatively flat during  as compared to during  oilfield servicing costs were a higher percentage of oilfield services revenues  as compared to  due to increased maintenance and repair costs associated with our oilfield servicing equipment 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on utilizing our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
dd a expense was  higher during  as compared to  primarily due to capital additions incurred during being depreciated during all of dd a expense was  lower during  as compared to  primarily due to prior year capital additions becoming fully depreciated during nonsegmented items dd a expense corporate 
dd a expense for corporate activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  during  and  respectively  on software  hardware and office equipment utilized primarily for corporate purposes 
dd a expense for corporate activities was progressively lower year to year  primarily due to assets purchased in prior years becoming fully depreciated in subsequent years 
amortization of deferred compensation g a 
amortization of deferred compensation was million and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no amortization of deferred compensation during on april   we extended the term of options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period 
on august   we extended the term of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period 
in accordance with fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  we incurred noncash deferred compensation costs of million  including  for the april   option extension and million for the august   option extension  to be amortized over their respective one year vesting periods from the date of extension 
g a costs corporate 
g a costs were  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  g a costs were million lower  as compared to  primarily due to the company writing off million of compensation that was accrued as of december  during  g a costs were  lower  as compared to the same period of  primarily due to lower payroll and associated costs 
subject to available funding  we expect to incur future g a costs at levels similar to that of and  or higher  in future periods as we continue our presence in poland 
interest and other income corporate 
interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable debt securities balances were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the average cash and marketable securities balances during   and were relatively constant from year to year 
however  due to lower interest rates during  we earned interest income of  as compared to  and  during and  respectively 
accrued interest income associated with notes receivable was   and  during  and  respectively 
also  during the year ended december   we recorded other income of  pertaining to amortizing an option premium resulting from granting rrpv an option to purchase gas from our properties in poland  and recorded other miscellaneous items totaling  interest expense 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during   we recorded  of imputed interest expense relating to our financing arrangement with rrpv and  for the short term financing of oilfield services equipment 
also  during  we capitalized  of interest costs pertaining to completing the tuchola during  we incurred  of interest expense relating to financing the purchase of five pickups used in our montana operations with one year notes 
during  we incurred  of interest expense primarily relating to the settlement of an audit by the blackfeet tribe pertaining to the cut bank field 
impairment of notes receivable 
impairment of notes receivable was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the notes receivable carrying value must be adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the market value of the underlying collateral 
on november   a former employee exercised an option to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the former employee elected to pay for the cost of the exercise by signing a full recourse promissory note with us for  terms of the note receivable included a three year term with annual principal payments of  plus interest accrued at 
on november   the former employee surrendered  shares of our common stock in return for cancellation of the note receivable 
we recorded a loss of  on the transaction and the acquisition of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  the closing price of our stock on november  also during  two of our officers surrendered collateral shares to us in return for the cancellation of the notes receivable from those officers that were outstanding on december  the officers notes included principal and interest of million reduced by a cumulative impairment allowance of million based on the market value of  shares of the our common stock held as collateral 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded the acquisition of  shares of treasury stock at a cost of  income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources general 
historically  we have relied primarily on proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and the sale of our common stock to fund our operating and investing activities 
during  we received million under the terms of our million loan agreement and gas purchase option agreement with rrpv 
during and  we received net proceeds of million and million  respectively  from the sale of our common stock in private transactions 
working capital 
we had working capital of   and million as of december   and  respectively 
during  we used million in our operating activities  received  from our investing activities and received million from our financing activities 
during  we used million in our operating activities  used million in our investing activities and received million from our financing activities 
during  we used million in our operating activities  used million in our investing activities and received million from our investing activities 
a detailed discussion regarding our cash flows from our operating  investing and financing activities during  and follows 
operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million and million in our operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses incurred in those years 
during  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on operating activities exclusive of changes in working capital items 
net changes in working capital items increased cash used in operating activities by  during and decreased cash used in operating activities by  and  during and  respectively 
investing activities 
we received net cash of  from our investing activities during and used net cash of million and million in investing activities during and  respectively 
during  we spent  on additions to proved properties  spent  on unproved properties  spent  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment  spent  on corporate assets  received  from the sale of a partial property interest  received a  credit for exploratory dry holes drilled in prior years and received million from maturing marketable debt securities 
also  during  apache covered  of our share of additional completion costs pertaining to the tuchola in accordance with terms of the poland agreement credit 
during  we spent million on exploratory dry holes  spent million on additions to proved properties  spent million on additions to unproved properties  spent  on additions to oilfield servicing equipment  spent  on corporate assets  spent million on purchasing marketable debt securities and received million from maturing or sold marketable debt securities 
also  during  apache covered  of our share of leasehold costs pertaining to the pomeranian and warsaw west project areas in accordance with terms of the poland agreement credit 
during  we spent million on exploratory dry holes  spent  on additions to properties  equipment and other assets  received  from the sale of property interests  spent million on purchasing marketable debt securities and received million from maturing or sold marketable debt securities 
financing activities 
we received net cash of million  million and million from our financing activities during  and  respectively 
during  we received million pertaining to our rrpv loan and gas purchase option agreement 
also  during  we acquired  shares of common stock at a cost of  in a noncash transaction 
during  we received net proceeds of million million gross from the private placement of  shares of our common stock and received  in cash and  in the form of a full recourse promissory note secured by  shares of our common stock from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
also  during  we acquired  shares of treasury stock at a cost of  in a noncash transaction 
during  we advanced  to two officers  received net proceeds of million million gross from a private placement of  shares of common stock and  from the exercise of options on  shares of our common stock 
carried costs 
in the past  our industry partners have provided a substantial amount of the capital required under our exploration agreements with them 
for instance  in  apache committed to cover our share of certain specific costs of the apache exploration program in poland  originally estimated to cost million gross approximately million net in order to earn an interest equal to ours in several of our polish project areas 
as of the end of  apache had completed all of the primary earning requirements of the apache exploration program  which included the following principal items that were completed between and o up front cash payments to us totaling  o our share of costs to drill the equivalent of ten exploratory wells two of which were new discoveries and eight were exploratory dry holes  o our share of costs to shoot the equivalent of  kilometers of d seismic data  o our share of leasehold costs in the lublin basin and carpathian project areas during the first three years of a six year exploration period  and o our share of apache poland g a through june  other industry partners have previously covered approximately million of our share of costs in other projects during the last six years 
capital requirements general 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents   of working capital and million of long term debt that is due on or before march  unless converted to restricted common stock at per share prior to march   coupled with a history of operating losses 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in addition  we have a remaining commitment of million that must be spent by us in order to earn a interest in the fences project area 
to date  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities and through agreements with industry partners that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in order to earn an interest in our properties 
as of the date of this report  we did not have a commitment from a third party to provide any additional funding for our ongoing operations 
the continuation of our exploratory efforts in poland is dependent on raising additional capital through attracting an industry or financial partner  raising additional equity  incurring additional debt  selling or farming out assets or completing other arrangements 
the availability of such capital will affect the timing  pace  scope and amount of our future capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing  reduce expenses or successfully complete other steps to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future cash requirements  we may be forced to curtail operations  dispose of assets or seek extended payment terms from our vendors 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
fences project area 
on april   we agreed to spend million of exploration costs on the fences project area located in southeast poland that is owned and operated by pogc  in order to earn a interest 
after we complete our million commitment  pogc will begin bearing its share of further costs 
currently  we are finalizing the formation of plotki gaz sa  a joint stock company through which we and pogc will conduct our ongoing exploration activities on the fences project area under terms of the million commitment 
as of december   we had paid cash expenditures of approximately million pertaining to our million commitment  including million on the kleka  million on the mieszkow and million on d seismic data acquisition in two separate surveys  all of which was paid during during  we did not make any cash expenditures pertaining to the million commitment 
at december   we had accrued million of costs incurred during on the fences project area  including  for the mieszkow and million for d seismic data acquisition 
upon formation of plotki  we anticipate assigning to an outside partner a portion of the project interests we convey to plotki  in consideration of the partner s assumption of all  or a portion of  our remaining obligation to earn an interest in the fences project area  including payment of the million accrued costs at december  during  we may commence drilling one or more additional exploratory wells at a gross cost of approximately million each  as warranted and as funding permits 
pomeranian project area 
during  we and our partners completed and tested the tuchola  at a cost of approximately million gross  net  and completed data acquisition on an approximately million gross  net d seismic program covering approximately kilometers to confirm main dolomite reef leads on regional d seismic data 
during  we intend to farm out part of our interest to an industry partner prior to conducting further exploratory activities on the pomeranian project area 
wilga project area 
during  we and our partners completed and tested the wilga under terms of the apache exploration program  apache covered our share of costs to complete and test the wilga we and our partners are now assessing and evaluating the pipeline and facility expenditures that will be required to commence production from the wilga other 
as a result of the completion of the apache exploration program and our limited financial resources  we have dropped our exploration acreage pertaining to the lublin basin project area except for wilga project area on block  which contains the wilga discovery and approximately  acres  the carpathian project area  the warsaw west project area and the baltic project area 
during  we wrote off all of our capitalized unproved property costs associated with the aforementioned items  which consisted solely of  for the warsaw west project area and  for the baltic project area 
under terms of the apache exploration program  apache carried the majority of our share of capital and exploratory expenditures incurred from through the end of relating to the lublin basin  carpathian and warsaw west project areas 
during  we expect to incur minimal exploration expenditures on our operations in the united states 
we may obtain funds for future capital investments from strategic alliances with other energy or financial partners  the sale of additional securities  project financing  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events that we cannot predict 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 the purchase method of accounting must be used for business combinations initiated after june  under sfas no 
effective for us beginning january   goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
the adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  the most significant impact of this standard to us will be a change in the method of accruing for site restoration costs 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of asset retirement obligations will be recorded as liabilities when they are incurred  which are typically at the time the assets are installed 
amounts recorded for the related assets will be increased by the amount of these obligations 
over time  the liabilities will be accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs will be depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted this statement on january  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
although sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for the recognition and measurement of the impairment for long lived assets 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our results of operations or financial position 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production in the united states is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
our gas production in poland is currently being sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing under a five year contract that may be terminated by us with a day written notice 
during  we sold oil produced during the wilga production test to a third party under a short term contract that has since been terminated 
commercial production from the wilga will not commence until after the associated facilities and pipeline that may be constructed are completed 
currently  we do not have a contract to sell future oil production from the wilga the limited volume of our oil and gas production means we cannot assure uninterruptible production or production in amounts that would be meaningful to industrial users  which may depress the price we are able to obtain 
there is currently no competitive market for the sale of oil or gas in poland 
accordingly  we expect that the prices we receive for the oil and gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland 
similarly  there is no established market relationship between oil and gas prices in short term and long term sales agreements 
the availability of abundant quantities of oil and gas from outside poland and the low cost of electricity from coal fired generating facilities may also tend to depress oil and gas prices in poland 
we currently do not engage in any hedging or trading activities or have any derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do so in the future if we achieve a significant amount of production in poland 
see items and business and properties risk factors 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland  primarily in us dollars or the us dollar equivalent of the polish zloty 
we conduct our day to day business on this basis as well
