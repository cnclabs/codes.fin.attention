it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
net income the company achieved earnings of million in  representing a increase from the million earned in  which was up over earnings of million

the loan loss provision was reduced slightly and noninterest income grew million or 
partially offsetting this higher revenue  noninterest expense expanded million  or 
earnings in increased million or over  also primarily due to higher net interest income  which grew by million or 
approximately two thirds of that increase was due to higher levels of earning assets and the remainder to a higher net interest margin 
in addition the loan loss provision was reduced by million  noninterest income grew thousand and noninterest expense grew slightly 
the company s return on average total assets was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
return on average equity in was percent  compared to percent and percent in the two previous years 
net interest income the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income fte increased million or from  to million in comparing to  net interest income fte increased million or components of net interest income year ended december  in thousands interest income    interest expense    fte adjustment    net interest income fte    net interest margin fte interest income fte decreased million or from to  the net effect of lower earning asset yields partially offset by a favorable change in the mix of those assets 
the total yield on earning assets dropped from in to in  following the trend in overall interest markets in which fed funds rates were reduced a record number of times  from a targeted rate of on december  to twelve months later 
the greatest decrease was on commercial loan yields down from to  or basis points  with relatively stable consumer loan yields declining basis points 
the investment portfolio yield was unchanged 
the effect of lower yields was to reduce interest income by million 
the total level of earning assets remained unchanged  but a shift from lower yielding investment securities to more profitable loans resulted in a million improvement in interest income 
interest expense decreased million or in compared to  principally due to lower rates paid 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was in  basis points or lower than in the most pronounced declines included rates paid on shorter term liabilities such as fed funds purchased down from to and public time deposits down from to 
rates paid on transaction deposit accounts decreased basis points 
this decrease had the effect of lowering the company s interest costs by million 
in addition  the reduced level and changed composition of interest bearing liabilities caused interest expense to decline an additional million 
interest income fte increased million or from to  primarily due to higher level of earning assets 
average loans outstanding grew million to billion  while investments declined million 
in addition to the net positive earning asset volume variance  the average rate earned on these assets also increased 
yields on loans grew from in to in while investments yields improved basis points to 
overall  the yield on the company s earning assets increased from in to in interest expense increased million or in due to the higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in the average rate paid was while in it increased to 
the largest individual increase was the rate paid on public time deposits  which grew by in to in the average rate paid on federal funds purchased increased from to 
partially offsetting these higher rates  the volume of interest bearing liabilities decreased during the year by million or 
the lower interest bearing liabilities were replaced by noninterest bearing transaction deposits  which grew million 
the following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  the amounts of interest income from average earning assets and the resulting yields  and the amount of interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
average loan balances include nonperforming loans 
interest income includes proceeds from loans on nonaccrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income 
yields on securities and certain loans have been adjusted upward to reflect the effect of income exempt from federal income taxation at the current statutory tax rate

investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of us treasury  us government agencies and corporations  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
the objective of the investment securities held to maturity is to strengthen the portfolio yield  and to provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the investments held to maturity had an average term to maturity of months at december  and  on the same date  those investments included million in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the banks liquidity 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  and are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the company held million classified as investments available for sale

asset quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and to increase diversification of earning assets 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
assets receiving lesser grades fall under the classified assets category  which includes all nonperforming assets and potential problem loans 
these loans receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
classified assets the following summarizes the company s classified assets for the periods indicated classified assets at december  dollars in thousands classified loans   other classified assets  total classified assets   classified loans at december  decreased million or to million from december   reflecting the effectiveness of the company s high underwriting standards and active workout policies 
other classified assets decreased million from the prior year  due to sales and writedowns of properties acquired in satisfaction of debt  partially offset by new foreclosures on loans with real estate collateral 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching days delinquent  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonperforming assets 
when the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that point are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
performing nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the nonperforming assets of the company for the periods indicated nonperforming assets at december  dollars in thousands performing nonaccrual loans      nonperforming nonaccrual loans      nonaccrual loans      loans or more days past due and still accruing  other real estate owned     total nonperforming assets      allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming assets performing nonaccrual loans at december  were thousand below a year earlier  while nonperforming loans increased thousand 
with the exception of three relationships totaling million  all loans on nonaccrual status in were either paid off or brought current in  with the net result of total nonaccrual loans remaining approximately unchanged 
all foreclosed property owned in was disposed of at a small gain during  the thousand owned at december  consists of seven small parcels 
performing nonaccrual loans at december  increased thousand from the prior year while nonperforming nonaccrual loans decreased thousand during the same period 
both categories were affected by extensive activity during the year  most loans that were on nonaccrual status at december   either were paid off or returned to full accrual status  while others replaced them 
the million decrease in other real estate owned balances from december  was due to writedowns and liquidations net of foreclosures 
the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded for nonaccrual loans if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period  was thousand in  thousand in and thousand in the amount of interest income that was recognized on nonaccrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand  thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared to thousand in and thousand in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  the total nonperforming assets could fluctuate from year to year 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to maintain nonperforming assets at their current levels  however  no assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual loans will not occur in future periods 
loan loss experience the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated based upon specific conditions  credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the allowance is allocated to segments of the loan portfolio based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified loan balances are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard allocation percentages 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the allowance to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
loans with similar characteristics that are not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines due to their small balances and numerous accounts are analyzed based on the historical rate of net losses and delinquency trends grouped by the number of days the payments on those loans are delinquent 
a portion of the allowance is also allocated to impaired loans 
management considers the million allowance for loan losses  which constituted percent of total loans at december   to be adequate as a reserve against inherent losses 
however  while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans on which the loss is considered probable  the risk exists of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolio and assess current economic conditions that will dictate future allowance levels

the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of thousand and thousand  respectively 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial loss risk 
all loans classified as loss are considered impaired 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance like kind loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in nonaccrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the periods indicated impaired loans year ended december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans   other   total impaired loans   specific reserves  the million balance of impaired loans as of december   other than nonaccrual loans  is due to one commercial real estate loan having collateral exposure that may preclude ultimate full repayment 
payment on this credit was current as of december  the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was million compared to million in portions of the company s allowance for credit losses were allocated to each of these impaired loans 
in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on troubled debt restructurings or loans that are classified as nonaccrual 
for other impaired loans  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may increase the company s interest rate risk position in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income nii that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculates the difference between a nii forecast over a month period using a flat interest rate scenario and a nii forecast using a rising or falling rate scenario  where the federal funds rate  serving as a driver  is made to rise or fall evenly by basis points over the month forecast interval triggering a response in the other rates 
company policy requires that such simulated changes in nii should always be within certain specified ranges or steps must be taken to reduce interest rate risk 
the following table summarizes the simulated change in nii  based on the month period ending december  simulated changes to net interest income dollars in millions changes in estimated increase interest decrease in nii rates estimated basis points nii amount amount percent the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the following table summarizes the interest rate sensitivity gaps inherent in the company s asset and liability portfolios at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis repricing within days dollars in thousands non over repricing total assets investment securities      loans      other assets   total assets       liabilities non interest bearing   interest bearing transaction     money market savings     passbook savings     time      short term borrowings    debt financing and notes payable    other liabilities   shareholders equity   total liabilities and shareholders equity       net liabilities assets subject to repricing      cumulative net liabilities assets subject to repricing     the repricing terms of the table above do not represent contractual principal maturity  but rather principal cash flows available for repricing 
the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitivity loans 
these factors cause the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than management believes really exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed 
liquidity the company s principal source of liquidity is its operating activities 
operating profitability in   and generated substantial cash flows of million  million and million respectively 
the company s investing activities were a net use of cash in substantial proceeds from maturing investment securities of million were all reinvested  for a net use of cash of million 
in addition  net disbursements of loans amounted to million 
other investing activities used million 
investing activities were a net source of cash in proceeds from maturing investment securities of million were only partially reinvested  for a net increase in cash of million 
much of this cash was consumed by net disbursements of loans  which amounted to million during the year 
other investing activities contributed million 
as in  investing activities were a net use in net disbursement of loans were million in and  in addition  the company increased its investment securities portfolio by million  primarily in us agencies and municipal securities  partially offset by decreases in us treasury and asset backed securities 
financing activities were a net use of cash in and  and a modest net source in cash was used in all three periods to repurchase company common stock million in  million in and million in cash was also used in all periods for the payment of shareholder dividends 
the company also used million cash in to reduce its short term borrowings  for a combined financing activity use for the year of million 
cash of million was used in to reduce short term borrowings as well  but the effect was largely offset by a million increase in deposits 
in sum  financing activities used million in cash in this contrasts to when short term borrowings increased by million and deposits decreased million  and financing activities resulted in a net provision of cash for the year 
the company anticipates maintaining its cash levels through the end of mainly due to increased profitability and retained earnings 
it is anticipated that the investment securities portfolio and demand of loans will continue to increase moderately  and that share repurchases continue 
the growth of deposit balances is expected to follow the anticipated growth in loan and investment balances through the end of however  due to the aftermath of the events of september   there is considerable uncertainty in the general economic environment which may impact loan demand 
capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
the company annually repurchases approximately million of its shares of common stock in the open market with the intention of lessening the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet employee stock awards  option plans  and other ongoing requirements 
in addition to these systematic repurchases  other programs have been implemented to optimize the company s use of equity capital and enhance shareholder value 
pursuant to these programs  the company repurchased an additional million shares in  thousand shares in and million in the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which decreased million or from the previous year  the net result of profits earned during the year  reduced by dividends paid and the effect of the company s ongoing share repurchase program

deficit fees are service charges collected from business customers that typically pay for such services with compensating balances 
in the current period of low interest rates  the earnings value of the balances has decreased  resulting in more customers being required to pay for services with explicit fees 
other categories of deposit account fees increased slightly 
service charges generated from users of the company s debit card product introduced in grew thousand to million  as volume continues to increase 
trust fees increased thousand with intensified marketing emphasis resulting in more trust assets under management 
financial services commissions were down thousand in because of lower sales of mutual fund products 
gains on sales of foreclosed property dropped thousand  as included the sale of one large property  and official check income was down thousand due to lower earnings on outstanding checks 
noninterest income increased thousand or in  primarily due to higher deposit service charges  specifically those related to customer overdrafts and items returned due to insufficient funds 
those categories benefited from revised service charge calculation methodologies implemented in late using a process of price escalators determined by volume by customer 
debit card income grew from thousand to million 
merchant credit card income grew by thousand due to expanding sales volume 
the other category included a million litigation settlement in that did not recur in  the decline was largely offset by increases in gains on sale of foreclosed property  atm surcharge income and revenue from the sale of official checks 
financial services commissions were high in due to fees earned upon one time product conversions

much of the increase was due to higher salary wage expense  which was up million 
the growth was due to merit increases granted to continuing staff and higher salary levels required to attract replacement personnel 
the thousand increase in incentive pay was the result of an increased accrual for incentives to be paid out based on performance and greater productivity incentives paid to sales staff 
occupancy expense was up thousand primarily due to higher energy costs 
intangible asset amortization included a full year of cost associated with the august  first counties bank acquisition  and contract courier expense grew thousand  as the company continued its strategy of providing courier services to an increased number of business clients 
included in the other category  which was up million  is a thousand special provision for nonrecurring operating losses 
other categories of expense decreased from  partially offsetting the increases outlined above 
equipment expense was down thousand due to reduced depreciation costs  as a major loan underwriting computer system became fully depreciated during the year  and lower computer maintenance made possible by hardware upgrades
