a detailed discussion of the securitization transactions utilized by the company is included in note  managed loans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   managed loans totaled billion  up from the billion at december   and billion at december  the percent increase in managed loans during was due to the company s focus on generating loan demand in the markets it serves  marketing efforts to grow loans in targeted customer segments and continued economic growth in most of the company s markets despite an overall slowdown in the national economy 
the billion increase in managed loans during was evenly split between growth in both the commercial and consumer categories 
as shown in the table below  the growth in commercial loans was primarily the result of an increase in commercial real estate mortgage loans and commercial  financial and agricultural loans 
the decrease in commercial real estate construction loans was primarily due to corporate customers refinancing to a permanent structure or taking advantage of declining interest rates to paydown existing debt 
the growth in consumer loans during occurred in all portfolios  led by consumer installment and residential real estate mortgage loans 
the increase in the consumer installment portfolio was primarily the result of increased activity in the company s indirect automobile portfolio  which totals approximately billion 
the improvement in residential real estate mortgage loans reflected the company s ability to deepen existing customer relationships through home equity loan and home equity line product offerings 
overall  the mix of the company s managed loan portfolio between commercial loans and consumer loans has remained relatively unchanged over the last three years

the primary objectives of the company s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the company s interest rate sensitivity position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
the company s investment securities are classified into one of three categories based upon management s intent to hold the investment securities i trading account securities  ii investment securities held to maturity or iii investment securities available for sale 
investment securities held in a trading account are required to be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investment securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  such amortization and accretion is determined by the interest method 
the company has the ability  and it is management s intention  to hold such securities to maturity 
management of the maturity of the portfolio is necessary to provide liquidity and control interest rate risk 
investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value 
increases and decreases in the net unrealized gain loss on the portfolio of investment securities available for sale are reflected as adjustments to the carrying value of the portfolio and  for the tax effected amounts  as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
fair values of trading account securities  investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available for sale are based primarily on quoted  or other independent  market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  then fair values are estimated using pricing models  quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics  or discounted cash flows 
fair values for trading account derivatives are estimated using pricing models 
interest earned on investment securities held to maturity  investment securities available for sale and trading account securities is included in interest income on the consolidated statements of income 
net gains and losses on the sale of investment securities available for sale  computed principally on the specific identification method  are shown separately in noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income

for an analysis of unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income  see note  comprehensive income  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total average investment securities  including both held to maturity and available for sale  increased percent and percent during and  respectively 
the increase in was due in part to the purchase of billion of securities  which was partially offset by the sale and maturity of billion of securities 
the increase in was primarily due to the securitization of approximately billion of residential mortgage loans and the transfer of substantially all of the resulting securities to the investment securities available for sale portfolio

trading account securities securities carried in the company s trading account securities portfolio  while interest bearing  are primarily held for sale to institutional customers for their investment portfolio and generally are sold within thirty days of purchase 
the volume of activity is directly related to general market conditions and reactions to the changing interest rate environment 
the average balance in the trading account securities portfolio decreased by percent from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the average balance in the trading account securities portfolio decreased by percent for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the following table details the composition of the company s trading account at december  and for additional information regarding the company s trading account securities  see note  off balance sheet activities  derivatives and hedging  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
trading account securities december in thousands us treasury and government agency states and political subdivisions mortgage backed pass through securities other securities collateralized mortgage obligations interest rate floors and caps deposits and borrowed funds deposits remain the company s primary source of funding loan growth 
average deposits totaled billion  a four percent decrease over prior year levels 
the decrease in deposits was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in average interest bearing deposits offset partially by a percent increase in transaction accounts noninterest bearing deposits  savings and money market accounts  and interest bearing checking accounts 
the decrease in interest bearing deposits was due to a strategic decision designed to re channel higher yielding certificates of deposit into lower cost funding sources while focussing on the growth of noninterest bearing deposits and transaction accounts 
as part of its overall funding strategy  the company focuses on the mix of deposits and  in particular  maintaining an appropriate level of transaction accounts as a percentage of total deposits 
during  average transaction accounts made up percent of total deposits  an increase over the prior two years 
average interest bearing deposits made up percent of total average interest bearing liabilities in  down from percent in and 
table of contents the following table summarizes the maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  maturities of time deposits certificates other time of deposit deposits over over   total in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months while the company continues to emphasize funding earning asset growth through internal deposit generation  average earning asset growth has exceeded deposit growth 
as a result  the company has relied more heavily on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding 
borrowed funds consist of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  subordinated debentures  guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures capital securities and short term borrowings  primarily in the form of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
average borrowed funds increased billion and million in and  respectively 
included in other short term borrowings are trading account short sales and the commercial paper of the company 
for a discussion of interest rates and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  and note  capital securities and preferred stock  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about deposits  see note  deposits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of its customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
additionally  the parent company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  business combinations  capital injections to its subsidiaries  the servicing of debt  and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from the subsidiary banks 
at december   the company s subsidiary banks could have paid additional dividends to the parent company of approximately million while continuing to meet the capital requirements for well capitalized banks 
also  the company has access to various capital markets 
the company does not anticipate any liquidity requirements in the near future that it will not be able to meet 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the company s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the company can earn a return that meets the investment requirements of its shareholders 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain an acceptable cash position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities held to maturity and available for sale and  to a lesser extent  sales of investment securities available for sale and trading account securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks  are additional sources of liquidity funding 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
table of contents and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and  basically  represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
during  the company funded the growth in interest earning assets through noninterest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  fhlb and other borrowings increased by billion in and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings increased by billion 
these increases in borrowings and noninterest bearing deposits were partially offset by a decrease of billion in certificates of deposit 
the decrease in certificates of deposit was due to a re channeling of higher yielding certificates of deposit into lower cost funding sources 
for more information on the composition of the company s long term borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  and note  capital securities and preferred stock  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about possible liquidity uses  see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its asset liability committee alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company 

table of contents management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the estimated impact on the company s net interest income sensitivity over a one year time horizon at december  is shown below along with comparable prior year information 
such analysis assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates  a static balance sheet and the company s estimate of how interest bearing transaction accounts will reprice in each scenario

a 
amounts for december  have not been restated for the acquisition of firstier corporation 
as shown in the table above  the company s net interest income sensitivity decreased from december  to december  in the down basis point rate scenario and increased in the up basis point rate scenario 
the significant decrease in market interest rates since december  has caused projected prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the up basis point scenario to be higher than at december  the increase in projected prepayments resulted in more cash flows being reinvested at higher rates in the up basis point scenario  thus increasing asset income 
however  a significant change in liability mix from certificates of deposit to wholesale funding more than offset this increase to income and 
table of contents increased the sensitivity to earnings in the up basis point scenario 
a purchase of interest rate floors in the second quarter contributed to the reduction in the bank s net sensitivity to lower rates 
the alco policy is based on the same assumptions as the preceding table and provides that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not reduce net interest income by more than six percent 
the company enters into various interest rate contracts not held in the trading account interest rate protection products to help manage the company s interest sensitivity 
such contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors 
interest rate swaps are contracts where the company typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  generally prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
interest rate caps and floors purchased or written are contracts whereby the company receives or pays  respectively  interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
refer to note  off balance sheet activities  derivatives and hedging  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for the composition of the company s interest rate protection contracts as well as a discussion of interest rate risks  credit risks and derivative instruments 
in addition to interest rate protection contracts used to manage overall interest sensitivity  the company also enters into interest rate contracts for the trading account 
the primary purpose for using interest rate contracts in the trading account is to facilitate customer transactions 
the trading interest rate contract portfolio is actively managed and hedged with similar products to limit market value risk of the portfolio 
changes in the estimated fair value of contracts in the trading account along with the related interest settlements on the contracts are recorded in other noninterest income as trading account profits and commissions

the company intends to continue a dividend payout ratio that is competitive in the banking industry while maintaining an adequate level of retained earnings to support continued growth 
subsequent to year end  the company s board of directors approved a nine percent increase in the annual dividend rate  raising it to per common share for this marked the st consecutive year the company has increased its dividend 
a strong capital position  which is vital to the continued profitability of the company  also promotes depositor and investor confidence and provides a solid foundation for the future growth of the organization 
the company has satisfied its capital requirements principally through the retention of earnings 
the company s five year compound growth rate in shareholders equity of percent was achieved primarily through reinvested earnings 

table of contents the ratio of average common shareholders equity as a percentage of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength 
overall  the company s capital position remains strong as the ratio of average common shareholders equity to average assets for was percent compared to percent in and percent in in order to maintain this ratio at appropriate levels with continued growth in total average assets  a corresponding level of capital growth must be achieved 
the table below summarizes these and other key ratios for the company for each of the last three years 
return on equity and assets december return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average common shareholders equity to average assets ratio in addition to the capital ratios mentioned above  banking industry regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the parent company and the subsidiary banks are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the banking industry regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off of the balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers that are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
tier i capital is defined as common shareholders equity  excluding the net unrealized holding gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  plus perpetual preferred stock and the capital securities  minus goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets 
other disallowed intangibles represent intangible assets  other than goodwill  recorded after february  total qualifying capital is defined as tier i capital plus tier ii capital components  which include such items as qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
at december   the company s tier i capital and total qualifying capital totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were percent and percent for tier i and total qualifying capital  respectively  at year end these ratios are well above the minimum requirements of four percent for tier i capital and eight percent for total qualifying capital 
tier i capital increased by million  or eight percent  in primarily as a result of earnings retained by the company partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million 
the stock repurchased was part of the company s repurchase plan announced during the third quarter of the board of directors of the parent company authorized a share repurchase program allowing for the purchase of up to five percent of the parent company s outstanding common stock 
the timing and amount of purchases under the program will be dependent upon the availability and alternative uses of capital  market conditions and other factors 
two other important indicators of capital adequacy in the banking industry are the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as tier i capital divided by total adjusted quarterly average assets 
average quarterly assets are adjusted by subtracting the average unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  period end goodwill and other disallowed intangibles 
the tangible leverage ratio is defined similarly  except  by definition  all other intangible assets not previously excluded are removed from both the numerator and denominator 
the company s leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end  while its tangible leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end

the company continually monitors these ratios to ensure that the subsidiary banks exceed the guidelines 
for further information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of the parent company and the subsidiary banks  see note  regulatory matters and dividends from subsidiaries  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of the federal banking regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise the regulatory capital treatment of recourse  direct credit substitutes and residual interests in asset securitizations 
this rule amends the regulatory capital standards by providing risk based capital treatment for recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes and adding new standards for residual interests  applying a ratings based approach that sets capital requirements for positions in securitized transactions according to their relative risk exposure  using credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations  deducting from tier i capital the amount of credit enhancing interest only strips that exceed percent of tier i capital  and requiring a dollar in risk based capital for each dollar of residual interests not deducted from tier i capital  except those qualifying under the ratings based approach 
this rule is effective january  for transactions entered into prior to the effective date of the rule  the application of this rule may be delayed to those transactions until december  banking industry regulators are currently evaluating this rule and its application to various transactions 
this rule could significantly affect risk based capital requirements and thus alter how the company structures future securitizations and could result in the company altering the structure of current transactions 
off balance sheet activities the company has agreements with two independent asset backed commercial paper conduits to diversify the company s funding sources 
assets sold to the conduits include highly rated investment grade debt securities and participation interests in a pool of commercial real estate loans 
all assets sold to the conduits were performing and no significant gains or losses were recognized on the sales 
during  the company sponsored the establishment of sunbelt funding corporation sunbelt  an asset backed conduit  created as a wholly owned subsidiary of an independent third party 
sunbelt was structured as a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  as defined by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 with a limited business purpose of purchasing highly rated investment grade debt securities from the company s trading account securities portfolio and financing its purchases through the 
table of contents issuance of p f rated commercial paper 
at december   all securities held by sunbelt were aaa aaa rated by at least two of the following nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations  moody s investor service  standard poor s or fitch ratings 
approximately percent of the securities held by sunbelt at december  were variable rate 
sunbelt s total assets  which approximated market value  were billion and million at december  and  respectively 
the company realized gains on the sale of securitized sba loans to sunbelt of million during both and the company realized fee income of million and million for and  from sunbelt for providing various services including serving as liquidity provider  investment advisor and administrative agent 
at december  and  receivables from sunbelt were million and million  respectively 
there were no outstanding payables to sunbelt at december  or the company  under agreements with sunbelt  may be required to purchase assets or provide alternative funding to the conduit in certain limited circumstances  including the conduit s inability to place commercial paper or a downgrade in the company s short term debt rating 
management believes if an event occurs  the company has the ability to provide funding without any material adverse effect since the underlying assets  which are all highly rated and primarily variable rate  are eligible investments for compass bank and would secure any advance 
the commitments  which are renewable annually at the company s option  are for amounts up to billion 
no funding or purchase of assets had occurred as of december  during  the company sold a million participation interest in a pool of performing commercial real estate loans to an unaffiliated third party asset backed commercial paper conduit 
this conduit is capable of achieving credit ratings superior to those of the company 
the transaction is revolving which allows the company to sell additional participations to maintain a million balance 
the market value of the assets sold approximated book value resulting in no gain or loss recognition at the date of sale 
under the terms of the transaction  the company remains obligated for any credit related charge offs 
the company recognized liquidity provider fee income and servicing fee income of million for at december   the receivable from the conduit was  and the payable was  the company  under agreements with the conduit  may be required to purchase loans or provide alternative funding to the conduit in certain limited circumstances  including the conduit s inability to place commercial paper 
management believes if an event occurs  the company has the ability to provide funding without any material adverse effect since the loans are performing and primarily floating rate 
the commitments  which are renewable annually at the company s option  are for amounts up to million 
at december   all loans were performing

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of a financial institution s income stream and represents the difference  or spread  between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
during   and the company s net interest income was affected by the federal reserve adjusting the federal funds target rate 
during  the federal funds target rate began at percent  was adjusted downward times  and ended the year at percent 
during both and the federal funds target was adjusted upward  beginning the years at percent and percent and ending the years at percent and percent  respectively 
the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
net interest income for increased percent over after increasing percent in over the increase in was primarily due to the re channeling of higher yielding liabilities into lower cost funding sources  as evidenced by the basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in was primarily a function of an percent increase in the volume of earning assets along with a basis point decrease in the yield 
the schedule on pages and provides detail regarding interest income  interest expense and net interest income due to changes in volumes and rates 

table of contents the yield on average earning assets decreased due to decreases in yields on most asset categories  including an basis point decrease in the yield on loans

net interest income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using the net yield and the interest rate spread 
the net yield on earning assets is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average total earning assets  excluding market adjustments for investment securities available for sale and hedges 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net yield increased basis points to percent in after decreasing basis points to percent in the increase in was due to the basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities that was only partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets 
the decline in was due to the basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets  which was more than offset by a basis point increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread increased basis points to percent from the spread of percent 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased basis points from the spread of percent 
see the accompanying table entitled consolidated average balance sheets and rate volume variances for more information 
during  the net yield on interest earning assets was impacted by the company s use of interest rate contracts  primarily interest rate swaps  increasing the taxable equivalent net yield on interest earning assets by basis points

table of contents provision for loan losses  net charge offs and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the annual cost of providing an allowance or reserve for estimated losses on loans 
the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
management monitors the entire loan portfolio  including loans acquired in business combinations  in an effort to identify problem loans so that risks in the portfolio can be identified on a timely basis and an appropriate allowance maintained 
loan review procedures  including loan grading  periodic credit re scoring and trend analysis of portfolio performance  are utilized by the company s loan review department in order to ensure that potential problem loans are identified early to lessen any potentially negative impact on the company s earnings 
management s involvement continues throughout the process and includes participation in the work out process and recovery activity 
these formalized procedures are monitored internally by the loan review department whose work is supplemented by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review on an annual basis 
such internal review procedures are quantified in ongoing reports to senior management and are used in determining whether such loans represent potential loss to the company 
the allowance for loan losses is established by risk group as follows large classified loans  nonaccrual loans and loans considered impaired are evaluated individually with specific reserves allocated based on management s review 
smaller nonaccrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
smaller past due loans are assigned a portion of the allowance using a formula that is based on the severity of the delinquency 
the remainder of the portfolio is also allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan portfolio 
allocation weights are assigned based on the company s historical loan loss experience in each loan category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that loan losses may exceed historical experience 
additionally  a portion of the allowance is for inherent losses which probably exist as of the valuation date even though they may not have been identified by the more objective processes used for the allocated portion of the allowance 
this portion of the allowance is particularly subjective and requires judgments based upon qualitative factors which do not lend themselves to exact mathematical calculations 
some of the factors considered are changes in credit concentrations  loan mix  changes in underwriting practices  including the extent of portfolios of acquired institutions  historical loss experience  and the general economic environment in the company s markets 
while the total allowance is described as consisting of separate portions  these terms are primarily used to describe a process 
all portions are available to support inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses at december   was million  or percent of loans  compared with million  or percent of loans  at december   and million  or percent of loans  at december  the increase in the allowance  for both and  was due to providing adequate coverage for strong loan growth and to increase the level of coverage based upon current economic conditions at the time 
as shown in the following table  net loan charge offs in were million  or percent of average loans  compared with million  or percent of average loans  in and million  or percent of average loans  in the increase in net charge offs during was due primarily to one large commercial energy related credit and a return to historical levels consistent with current economic conditions 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate given past experience and the underlying strength of the loan portfolio

table of contents when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in nonperforming and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and current economic conditions 
the portion of the allowance that has not been identified by the company as related to specific loan categories has been allocated to the individual loan categories on a pro rata basis for purposes of the table below

it is the general policy of the company to stop accruing interest income and place the recognition of interest on a cash basis when any commercial  industrial or real estate loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest and the ultimate collection of either is in doubt  unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security 
accrual of interest income on consumer loans is suspended when any payment of principal or interest  or both  is more than days delinquent 
credit card loans and the related accrued interest are charged off before the end of the month when the loan becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income unless the collateral for the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest or a guarantor assures payment of interest 
nonperforming assets at december   were million  a decrease of million from year end nonperforming loans decreased million from year end to million 
during  million of loans were transferred to other real estate owned ore offset by total sales of other real estate owned of million  of which substantially all were cash sales

noninterest income totaled million in  an increase of percent from the prior year  and million in  an increase of percent from that reported in fee income from service charges on deposit accounts increased percent in both and the increases in service charges on deposit accounts were primarily due to the success of the company s deposit strategy to increase transaction accounts along with significantly increased revenues from the company s corporate treasury and cash management services

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report on form k will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and securities portfolios  the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits  and the information related to off balance sheet hedging activities discussed in note  off balance sheet activities  derivatives and hedging  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  should be considered
