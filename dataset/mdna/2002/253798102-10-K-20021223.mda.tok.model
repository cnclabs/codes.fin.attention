item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report contains certain statements that are forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of  and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  target  may  will  expect  plan  project  should  or continue or the negative thereof or other expressions  which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters  identify forward looking statements 
such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to  among other things  expectations of the business environment in which the company operates  projections of future performance  perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding the company s mission and vision 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the future operating results and performance trends of the company may be affected by a number of factors  including  without limitation  those described under risk factors below 
those risk factors  and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions identified from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  including without limitation  its quarterly reports on form q and its registration statements  could cause the company s actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission and of changes in general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and or exchange rates and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
risk factors the company s dependence on new product development and the rapid technological change that characterizes the company s industry make it susceptible to loss of market share resulting from competitors product introductions and similar risks 
the data communications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and rapidly changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products  to introduce new products to meet changing customer requirements and emerging technologies  and to demonstrate the performance advantages and cost effectiveness of its products over competing products 
any failure by the company to modify its products to support new alternative technologies or any failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of such modified products could cause the company to lose market share and cause its revenues to decline 
the company may experience delays in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  and marketing of these products or product enhancements  or that its new products 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors continued and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance in existing or additional markets 
failure by the company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the future introductions or announcements of products by the company or one of its competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry standards or customer requirements could render the company s then existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by the company or one or more of its competitors will not cause customers to defer the purchase of the company s existing products  which could cause its revenues to decline 
the company intends to continue to devote significant resources to its research and development  which  if not successful  could cause a decline in its revenues and harm its business 
the company intends to continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the coming years to enhance and develop additional products 
for the fiscal years ended   and  the company s research and development expenses comprised   and  respectively  of total net sales 
if the company is unable to develop new products as a result of its research and development efforts  or if the products the company develops are not successful  its business could be harmed 
even if the company develops new products that are accepted by its target markets  the net revenues from these products may not be sufficient to justify its investment in research and development 
certain of the company s products that generate a substantial amount of its revenue are sold into mature markets  which could limit the company s ability to generate revenue from these products 
certain of the company s products provide asynchronous and synchronous data transmissions via add on cards 
the market for add on asynchronous and synchronous data communications cards is a mature market 
these products currently generate about one half of the company s revenues 
as the overall market for these products decreases due to the adoption of newer technologies  the company expects that its revenues from these products will continue to decline 
as a result  the company s future prospects depend in large part on its ability to acquire or develop and successfully market additional products that address growth markets 
the company s failure to effectively manage product transitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
from time to time  the company or its competitors may announce new products  capabilities  or technologies that may replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s existing products 
announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing the company s products until new products become available 
furthermore  the introduction of new or enhanced products requires the company to manage the transition from older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
the company s failure to effectively manage transitions from older products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors continued the company s failure to compete successfully in its highly competitive market could result in reduced prices and loss of market share 
the market in which the company operates is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards 
the market can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants 
the company competes for customers on the basis of product performance in relation to compatibility  support  quality and reliability  product development capabilities  price  and availability 
certain of the company s competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing  and personnel resources than the company 
present and future competitors may be able to identify new markets and develop products more quickly  which are superior to those developed by the company 
they may also adapt new technologies faster  devote greater resources to research and development  promote products more aggressively  and price products more competitively than the company 
there are no assurances that competition will not intensify or that the company will be able to compete effectively in the markets in which the company competes 
the company s concentrated customer base increases the potential adverse effect on the company from the loss of one or more customers 
the company s products have historically been sold into highly concentrated customer markets 
two customers comprised more than of net sales each during the fiscal years ended   and tech data at   and  respectively  and ingram micro at   and  respectively 
the company s sales are primarily made on the basis of purchase orders rather than under long term agreements  and therefore  any customer could cease purchasing the company s products at any time without penalty 
the decision of any key customer to cease using the company s products or a material decline in the number of units purchased by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 
the long and variable sales cycle for certain of the company s products makes it more difficult for the company to predict its operating results and manage its business 
the sale of the company s products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by potential customers and end users  as well as delays frequently associated with end users internal procedures to deploy new technologies within their products and to test and accept new technologies 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with certain of the company s products is typically lengthy and is subject to a number of significant risks  including end users internal purchasing reviews  that are beyond the company s control 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of customer orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  the company s operating results for that quarter could be materially adversely affected 
the company depends on manufacturing relationships and on limited source suppliers  and any disruptions in these relationships may cause damage to the company s customer relationships 
the company procures all parts and certain services involved in the production of its products and subcontracts most of its product manufacturing to outside firms that specialize in such services 
although most of the components of the company s products are available from multiple vendors  the company has several single source supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors continued advantageous to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for products and components in a timely fashion 
in addition  the availability of many of these components to the company is dependent in part on the company s ability to provide its suppliers with accurate forecasts of its future requirements 
delays or lost sales could be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by vendors of components 
if the company is required to identify alternative suppliers for any of its required components  qualification and pre production periods could be lengthy and may cause an increase in component costs and delays in providing products to customers 
any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from limited sources could disrupt the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships and profitability 
the company s ability to compete could be jeopardized if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s ability to compete depends in part on its proprietary rights and technology 
although the company has certain patents and patent applications and may seek additional patents where appropriate for proprietary technology  the company s proprietary technology and products are generally not patented 
the company relies primarily on the copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  and sometimes with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to the distribution of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of its technology 
the company s pending patent applications may be denied and any patents  once issued  may be circumvented by the company s competitors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are superior to the company s technologies 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology 
the company s failure to adequately protect its proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and result in loss of revenue 
from time to time  the company is subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm the company and require the company to incur significant costs 
the data communications industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
from time to time  the company receives notification of a third party claim that its products infringe other intellectual property rights 
any litigation to determine the validity of third party infringement claims  whether or not determined in the company s favor or settled by the company  may be costly and divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel from productive tasks  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate its business and service the needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that any infringement claims by third parties  if proven to have merit  will not materially adversely affect the company s business or financial condition 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any such matter  the company may be required to pay substantial damages  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors continued cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or be required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on the company s ability to market its products  or delays and costs associated with redesigning its products or payments of license fees to third parties  or any failure by the company to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
the company faces risks associated with its international operations and expansion that could impair its ability to grow its revenues abroad 
in the fiscal years ended september    and  net sales to customers outside the united states  primarily in europe  were approximately   and  respectively  of total net sales 
the company believes that its future growth is dependent in part upon its ability to increase sales in international markets 
these sales are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences  and export license requirements 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business strategy and financial condition 
if the company loses key personnel it could prevent the company from executing its business strategy 
the company s business and prospects depend to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of its executive officers and its key technical personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could result in the company s failure to execute its business strategy 
any acquisitions the company has made or will make could disrupt its business and seriously harm its financial condition 
the company will continue to consider acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
in the event of any future purchases  the company could issue stock that would dilute the company s current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  or incur large and immediate write offs 
the company s operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies  or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from the company s core business  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors continued difficulties integrating businesses in different countries and cultures  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that the company has acquired or that the company might acquire in the future and any failure to do so could disrupt its business and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  from time to time the company may enter into negotiations for a proposed acquisition  but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisition under consideration 
this could cause significant diversion of management s attention and out of pocket expenses to the company 
the company could also be exposed to litigation as a result of an unconsummated acquisition  including claims that it failed to negotiate in good faith or misappropriated confidential information 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth selected information from the company s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales and as a percentage of change from year to year for the years indicated

in addition to the factors discussed below  the company s net sales in were lower than fiscal year net sales  partially due to an industry wide decline in demand associated with the economic downturn 
connectivity solution sales for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal year due to erosion of the asynchronous product market  offset partially by market share gain  asynchronous sales declined by million in fiscal sales of the company s synchronous and ras products declined million in relative to the company phased out its isdn product line from which revenues declined million relative to repositioning of the company s product lines and acquired expertise in usb and device server connectivity solutions added to fiscal year net sales 
net sales of the terminal server  usb  and device server product lines increased by million 
net sales from the company s milan product line also increased 
the milan increase of million in fiscal relative to was primarily due to increases in volumes of media conversion products that were delivered to the education market

the decline in connectivity solutions net revenue was related to the decline in demand in the communications networking industry associated with the continued economic downturn 
the company generally recognizes product revenue at the date that products are shipped to distributors or original equipment manufacturers 
upon adoption of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its revenue recognition policy with regard to certain product sales 
essentially  the new policy recognizes that the risks and rewards of ownership in certain transactions do not substantively transfer to customers upon shipment of the products 
these new policies are consistent with the guidance contained in sab the effect of this change in revenue recognition policy  as of october   was reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal of million  net of taxes  which includes revenue of approximately million  less cost of sales and certain direct selling expenses

the acquisition of netsilicon and sale of the milan business also contributed to the increase in gross margin because embedded networking solution products generally have higher gross margins than lan connectivity products 
gross margin in was  compared to in the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to sales volume declines in and the mix of lower margin milan products

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating expenses continued selling and marketing expenses decreased million due to a decrease in milan related expenses of million along with million of additional decreases in marketing related activities including cooperative advertising  ad placements  tradeshows  and promotional items 
also  there was a million decrease as a result of the workforce reductions made by the company in september  along with a decrease in selling commissions commensurate with the decrease in revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by the incremental expenses from netsilicon and inxtech  which were acquired in and  respectively  of million 
research and development expenses increased million due to an increase of million resulting from research and development activities associated with the recently acquired netsilicon  inxtech and inside out networks  which were partially offset by decreases in milan related expenses of million  and headcount reductions that resulted in a decrease in research and development expenses of million

impairment loss in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an million charge reflecting the write down of the carrying value of all of the intangible assets associated with the netblazer technology and some of the goodwill acquired in the company s july purchase of itk 
the write down resulted from the company s march decision to discontinue development of the netblazer technology when the key technical members of the netblazer technology team elected to leave the company and the company concluded that it would not be able to successfully develop a competitive product from the technology 
accordingly  the company determined that future undiscounted cash flows from the acquired itk assets would be substantially reduced  and therefore  the carrying value of the acquired itk assets would be impaired 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements

the charge will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal restructuring the million restructuring charge recorded in fiscal was the result of a board approved workforce reduction of or employees 
the restructuring charge consists of severance and termination costs  lease cancellation fees  and office closing expenses 
the company anticipates annual cost savings of approximately million to result from this restructuring

acquired in process research and development on february   the company acquired netsilicon  inc netsilicon  a provider of ethernet micro processing solutions for intelligent  networked devices for a purchase price of million 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
included in the purchase price allocation was a million charge to acquired in process research and development 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued at the time of acquisition  netsilicon had two development projects in process  the net microprocessor subsequently renamed the microprocessor and the net os v 
the project involved the design and development of a low cost  high performance networking microprocessor 
the net os v 
project included significant and innovative advancements to the netsilicon operating system in the areas of security and management 
the design  verification and other processes involved in the project required tools and skills that were new to netsilicon 
similarly  the advanced and innovative features being developed for inclusion in the net os v 
operating system differed from existing net os features 
accordingly  the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed could become commercially viable 
if these products were not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company would be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired may become impaired 
management estimates that million of the purchase price represents the fair value of purchased in process research and development related to the chip and the net os v 
operating system referred to above  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
this amount was expensed as a non recurring  non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition 
the company utilized the income valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
these estimates are based on the following assumptions the estimated revenues are based upon netsilicon s estimate of revenue growth over the next four fiscal years from the revenue growth of the net os v 
and the chips 
the estimated gross margin is based upon historical gross margin for netsilicon s products  which include chips  boards  and development kits 
average gross margin is approximately 
the estimated selling  general and administrative expenses is based on consideration of historical operating expenses as a percentage of sales and netsilicon s projected operating expenses 
cost to complete each project was based on estimated remaining labor hours and a fully burdened labor cost  and other direct project expenses 
the discount rate used in the alternative income valuation approach is based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on various required rates of return from investments in various areas of that enterprise 
the discount rate used in the alternative valuation approach was 
premiums were added to the wacc to account for the inherent risks in the development of the products  the risks of the products being completed on schedule  and the risk of the eventual sales of the product meeting the expectations of the company 
the following rates of return were used for the in process research and development products net os v

gain from forgiveness of grant payable in connection with the acquisition of itk international  inc itk in july  the company assumed a liability for an investment grant payable of  to the german government relating to construction of the itk facility in dortmund  germany 
the investment grant contained a provision that the grant would be forgiven if itk retained a specified number of employees in the facility for a five year period 
because itk was not in compliance with the minimum employment requirements of the grant at the time of the acquisition or subsequent to the acquisition  the company continued to reflect the grant payable as a liability and to accrue interest on the principal balance of the grant 
the company had recorded  of accrued interest through may during  the company applied for a waiver of the employment provision in the investment grant based on unforeseeable developments in the european market that resulted in a smaller workforce 
the waiver of the investment grant payable was approved in may by the german government 
accordingly  the company reversed the investment grant payable and the related accrued interest payable of  and  respectively 
the principal portion of the forgiveness of the investment grant was recorded as a component of operating loss for fiscal  and the reversal of the accrued interest payable was recorded as a component of other income 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of september  still reflects an investment grant payable and accrued interest payable of  and  respectively

 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  requiring that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method 
fas provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
in addition  fas expands the disclosure requirements about goodwill and other intangible assets in the years subsequent to their acquisition 
the company will adopt the provisions of fas at the beginning of fiscal year however  the transition provisions of fas apply to the company s accounting for the netsilicon acquisition as this acquisition occurred after june  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as prescribed by fas  the company has identified its reporting units  in order to be able to assign assets and liabilities to those reporting units and test for impairment losses for goodwill that could arise due to the initial application of the standard resulting from the transitional impairment test 
the company s connectivity solutions reporting segment is comprised of two operating segments 
the operating segments include inside out networks  and all other business units of the company  excluding netsilicon

fas requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation  an entity shall capitalize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount as the liability

fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under previous rules  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
generally  the provisions of fas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company has not completed its analysis of the effects of fas  but does not expect the impact of the adoption to be significant to its financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of products to its distributors and original equipment manufacturer oem customers  and to a lesser extent from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training and engineering services and royalties 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and there are no post delivery obligations 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers  including oems and distributors 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and original equipment manufacturers are made with certain rights of return and price protection provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by the company based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price protection claims as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price protection are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
the company offers rebates to authorized domestic and international distributors and authorized resellers 
the rebates are incurred based on the level of sales to the respective distributors and resellers  and are charged to operations as a reduction in revenue in the same period as the corresponding sales 
the company also generates revenue from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training and engineering services and royalties 
revenue from software maintenance obligations is deferred and recognized at the time the service is provided or over the life of the underlying service or support contract  if applicable 
unearned software maintenance and unearned nonrecurring engineering services revenue is included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
generally  the company recognizes revenue under agreements for nonrecurring engineering services using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of actual labor hours incurred to total estimated labor hours for individual contracts 
however  the company defers revenues from non recurring engineering services until delivery if  at the inception of the arrangement  there is uncertainty about delivery and or the costs of delivery can not be accurately estimated 
the company s software development tools and developments boards often include multiple elements hardware  software  post contract customer support pcs  limited training and basic hardware design review 
our customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
the company recognizes 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition continued revenue related to these multiple element arrangements in accordance with statement of position sop no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of sop revenue related to the sale of these development products is allocated to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectibility of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company reduces the carrying value of its inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets purchased proven technology  license agreements  covenants not to compete and other intangible assets are recorded at fair value when acquired in a business acquisition  or at cost when not purchased in a business combination 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and  for acquisitions prior to june  is being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from five to fifteen years 
for goodwill resulting from the netsilicon acquisition  which occurred after june   goodwill is not amortized but will be subject to an impairment assessment at least annually 
purchased in process research and development costs ipr d are expensed upon consummation of the related business acquisition 
all other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of four to ten years 
useful lives for intangible assets are estimated at the time of acquisition based on the periods of time from which the company expects to derive benefits from the intangible assets 
methods of amortization reflect the pattern in which the asset is consumed 
intangible assets are reviewed quarterly for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value amount 
the company measures impairment loss by comparing the fair market value  calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows  to its net book value or carrying amount 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded currently 
the company will record a goodwill impairment charge of approximately to million  attributable primarily to an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill related to the acquisition of netsilicon and goodwill related to the cdc and inxtech acquisitions 
the charge will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting practices continued income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities actually realized could be impacted by differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income 
if management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be required  and would be reflected as income tax expense at that time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have material exposure to market risk from market sensitive financial instruments other than the currency risk associated with certain transactions being denominated in euros 
the company has some exposure to credit risk related to its accounts receivable portfolio 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through continuous monitoring procedures  credit limits and collaboration with sales management on customer contacts to facilitate payment
