item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of high quality oncology products that both extend life and improve the quality of life for cancer patients worldwide 
we have established a balanced pipeline of oncology drug candidates that includes both next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and novel mechanism based  gene targeted therapies 
we currently have four proprietary candidates in clinical trials and two additional candidates in clinical trials with pfizer 
our most advanced drug candidate  tarceva tm erlotinib hc  is a small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor  or her egfr 
the protein product of the her egfr gene is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is over expressed or mutated in many major solid tumors 
we believe her egfr inhibitors represent an exciting new class of relatively safe and well tolerated anti cancer agents that may have utility in treating a wide range of cancer patients 
tarceva tm is an oral once a day small molecule drug designed to specifically block the activity of the her egfr protein 
currently  tarceva tm is being developed in an alliance with genentech  inc and roche 
if the drug receives regulatory approval  genentech will lead the marketing effort in the united states and roche will market it in the rest of the world 
we will receive milestone payments from both genentech and roche  an equal profit share from us sales  and royalties on sales outside of the united states 
tarceva tm has demonstrated encouraging indications of anti cancer activity in single agent  open label phase ii trials in non small cell lung cancer  head and neck cancer and ovarian cancer 
tarceva tm is currently in phase iii clinical trials for non small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer 
behind tarceva tm we have five additional drug candidates in earlier stages of clinical development 
three of these osi  osi l and osi are next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and the other two cp  and cp  are gene targeted therapies currently being developed by pfizer inc we own commercial rights to the first three and will receive royalty payments on the latter two if they are successfully commercialized 
our next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy candidates are designed to improve upon currently marketed products in the same drug class 
osi is a liposomal formulation of lurtotecan  a topoisomerase inhibitor  that is being developed to compete with topotecan hycamptin r 
osi l is a liposomal formulation of a thymidylate synthase inhibitor  gw  that is being developed as a potential competitor to fluorouracil fu and capecitabine xeloda r  and osi is a nucleoside analog being developed to compete with gemcitabine gemzar r 
osi is in phase ii clinical trials  and osi l and osi are in phase i clinical trials 
like tarceva tm  the two gene targeted therapies are receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
cp  is a small molecule targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  or vegfr  and cp  is a small molecule targeting her erbb both agents are currently in phase i clinical trials 
in order to support our clinical pipeline  we have established through acquisition and internal investment a high quality oncology clinical development and regulatory affairs capability and a pilot scale chemical manufacturing and process chemistry group 
behind our clinical pipeline we have an extensive  fully integrated small molecule drug discovery organization designed to generate a pipeline of high quality oncology drug candidates to move into clinical development 
this research operation has been built upon our historical strengths in high throughput screening  chemical libraries  medicinal and combinational chemistry  and automated drug profiling technology platforms 
key business transactions during fiscal we believe that tarceva tm has established a corporate presence for us in the oncology field 
our strategy over the last several years has been designed to capitalize upon this presence and to re orient our business toward becoming a world class oncology organization 
to this end  we have raised capital  formed alliances and engaged in merger and acquisition activity as set forth below 
on december   we acquired certain oncology assets from gilead sciences  inc  which included a pipeline of three clinical oncology candidates and certain related intellectual property  as well as gilead s boulder  colorado operations  including clinical research and drug development personnel  infrastructure and facilities 
the gilead employees retained by us provide us with extensive expertise in clinical development  regulatory affairs  toxicology and in vivo pharmacology 
the acquisition forms a key part of our strategy to build a completely integrated and high quality drug discovery  development and commercial organization in oncology 
the acquisition has complemented and enhanced our ability to successfully execute key components of our business strategy  including carrying out our obligations for the development and registration of tarceva tm in our alliance with genentech and roche 
in consideration for these assets  we paid gilead million in cash and issued to gilead  shares of common stock valued at million 
we will also be obligated to pay up to an additional million in either cash  stock or a combination of cash and common stock upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development of osi formerly nx 
we also assumed certain royalty and milestone obligations to third parties in connection with these oncology products 
at the conclusion of fiscal  we completed a transaction with british biotech plc whereby we assumed the leases for two state of the art research and development facilities in oxford  england and acquired employees  of whom were engaged in research and development activities with the remainder in administrative positions 
during fiscal  we ceased operations at our birmingham  england facility and relocated those operations and certain personnel to our new oxford facility and integrated the assets acquired from british biotech into our existing operations 
on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and mature on february  we are planning to use the proceeds from the sale of the notes for continued development of our product pipeline  licensing and acquisition opportunities that add oncology products and drug candidates  and general corporate purposes 
in august and september  taking advantage of a market opportunity  we retired a total of million in principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  including accrued interest of  with oncology as our focus  we have made the strategic decision to divest all non oncology research programs by the end of our second quarter in fiscal  and realign our internal resources toward an oncology strategy 
in july  we agreed to accelerate the conclusion of the phase down period of our funded research alliance with anaderm research corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of pfizer focused on the development of novel treatments for skin and hair conditions 
as of september   we received million of a total million phase down fee for transferring to anaderm all of our research related to this collaboration 
we will also receive royalties on the sale of products for these treatments which may arise from compounds that we have identified 
we expect the transfer to be completed by january we also plan to divest our diabetes program and certain of our adenosine receptor assets into a newly formed and externally funded entity in which we will maintain a minority interest 
our diabetes program includes a partnership with the vanderbilt university diabetes center  a funded alliance with tanabe seiyaku co 
ltd  and six proprietary gene targeted discovery programs in the lead seeking and lead optimization phases  primarily focused in the glucose regulation and obesity fields 
we also intend to transfer to this entity our existing diabetes teams comprised of approximately employees 
if we are unable to obtain external funding for this newly formed entity  we will consider other alternatives to discontinue the diabetes program  including the out licensing of diabetes assets and employee headcount reductions 
historically  our research organization had been established to provide early stage discovery research services to our pharmaceutical industry partners who funded these activities 
since some of our employee skill sets were from this multi disease drug discovery service focus of our past collaborations and not ideally suited to an oncology only strategy  in october  we made the decision to reduce our employee headcount by approximately as we strive to better balance our staff and skill sets to focus on oncology while maintaining strict fiscal control of the business 
this action left us with employees and will now allow us to hire additional oncology expertise  as needed 
to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs have resulted in commercial products  therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products by us or by our collaborators 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of common stock  the private placement of convertible debt securities and payments under collaborative research agreements with major pharmaceutical companies 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize all nonrefundable upfront license fees  including upfront technology access fees  as revenue over the term of the related research collaboration period in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended  or sab no 
our most significant application of this policy  to date  is the million in upfront fees received from genentech and roche in january which was originally being recognized evenly over the expected three year term of our required research and development efforts under the terms of the agreement 
the expected term is subject to change based upon the parties continuous monitoring of current research data and their projections for the remaining development period 
a change in this expected term impacts the period over which the remaining deferred revenue would be recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the expected term was changed to four years to reflect the revised estimated timing of our research and development commitment for tarceva tm under the alliance 
the revision was a result of the review of the current research data available  current developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the clinical development plan 
as a result of this revision  we recorded revenues of million in the fourth quarter compared to million had the upfront fees continued to be recognized over a three year period 
collaborative program revenues represent funding arrangements for research and development in the field of biotechnology and are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts and the related development activities undertaken 
other revenues are recognized pursuant to the terms of grants which provide reimbursement of certain expenses related to our other research and development activities 
collaborative and other revenues are accrued for expenses incurred in advance of the reimbursement and deferred for cash payments received in advance of expenditures 
such deferred revenues are recorded as revenue when earned 
accruals for clinical research organization and clinical site costs we make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to external clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical site costs 
we analyze the progress of clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions 
intangible and long lived assets intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired which might result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal results of operations our fiscal net loss of million increased million compared to our fiscal net loss of million 
the increase in the net loss was primarily related to the one time in process research and development  or in process r d  charge of million in connection with the acquisition of gilead s oncology assets 
excluding the non recurring charge of million related to the in process r d acquired  the net loss for fiscal would have been million or per share  an increase of million compared to fiscal this increase in the net loss is primarily due to an increase in development costs associated with tarceva tm and the three clinical candidates acquired from gilead 
included in the net loss for fiscal was a non cash charge of million related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the recognition of upfront fees upon the adoption of sab no 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of this change in accounting principle  the net loss for fiscal would have been million or per share 
revenues total revenues of million in fiscal decreased million or compared to fiscal total collaborative program revenues of million in fiscal decreased million or compared to fiscal these decreases were primarily due to the phase down of our collaboration with anaderm commencing in april and the conclusions of our funded collaborations with pfizer in april  sankyo co  ltd 
in december and solvay pharmaceuticals  inc in december in july  we entered into an agreement with pfizer to accelerate the phase down period of the collaboration with anaderm so that it will terminate no later than april  in consideration for the work to be performed by us during the accelerated phase down period  we received million in september and will receive million upon the successful completion of the transition period 
the million will be recognized as revenue ratably over the expected term of the transition period and the million will be recognized upon the successful completion of the transition 
we expect this transition to be completed by january for fiscal  we recognized million of revenue related to the phase down 
as we continue to focus our business away from collaborative based to independent drug discovery and development  we expect collaborative revenue to continue to decrease 
license and related revenues of million in fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the recognition of the pro rata portion of the million upfront fees received from genentech and roche for months in fiscal compared to only nine months in fiscal see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
 we were recognizing the million received from genentech and roche evenly over the expected three year development phase of our agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the expected term of the agreement to four years to reflect the revised estimated timing of our research and development commitment for tarceva tm under the alliance 
the revision was a result of the review of the current research data available  current developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the clinical development plan 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting change  the remaining deferred revenue will be recognized prospectively over the revised term 
as a result  we recorded revenues of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million had we continued to recognize the upfront fees over a three year period 
other revenues of million in fiscal were primarily related to transition assistance services provided to gilead and certain administrative services provided to british biotech during the transition periods under our respective agreements with each of them 
expenses operating expenses of million increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses primarily included i research and development  or r d  expenses  which include expenses related to the development of our lead clinical candidate  tarceva tm  and proprietary and collaborative based research  ii the million charge related to the acquired in process r d related to the oncology assets acquired from gilead  iii selling  general and administrative expenses  and iv amortization of intangibles 
we intend to hold our core operating costs  including expenses related to tarceva tm development  to approximately million over the next year 
research and development expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was related primarily to increased costs associated with i the clinical development of tarceva tm under our tripartite agreement with genentech and roche  ii increased investments in our proprietary cancer programs  including oncology candidates acquired from gilead in december  and iii increased investments in our core proprietary research programs and facilities 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in collaborative based research expenses  a reduction in certain stock option based compensation charges in comparison to the prior year  and a restructuring charge included in fiscal of approximately million 
this restructuring charge related to the closing of our tarrytown  new york and birmingham  england facilities  as further discussed below 
on august   the board of directors granted non qualified stock options to purchase up to  common shares to our then new president and head of research and development 
the terms of this grant provided for an option to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to of the fair market value on the grant date vesting immediately upon his employment date on september  ie  the measurement date  and an option to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date vesting one third in a year from the measurement date and monthly thereafter for twenty four months 
the granting of the options at of fair market value resulted in a compensation charge of million in fiscal the granting of the other options resulted in deferred compensation of million as of september   which was to be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
a significant portion of this compensation expense was due to the high volatility of our common stock price between the grant date and the measurement date 
in fiscal   of compensation expense was included in r d expenses compared to million in fiscal as a result of his resignation as an employee effective february   no additional compensation expense has been recorded subsequent to february  and the remaining deferred compensation of million was reversed 
in addition  other stock options granted to non employees in connection with their consulting arrangements resulted in the recognition of  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and deferred compensation of  and million as of september  and  respectively 
in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods related to the non employee grants is subject to change each reporting period based upon the then fair value of these options  using a black scholes option pricing model  until expiration of the vesting period 
in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from gilead in fiscal  we recorded an in process r d charge of million representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we obtained a third party valuation to assist us in determining the fair value of certain assets 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flow from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
these cash flows were probability adjusted to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the acquired in process technology 
the resulting net cash flows were based on estimated revenue  cost of sales  r d costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and the net cash flow reflects the assumptions that would be used by market participants 
in determining the value of the in process r d  the assumed commercialization dates for these products ranged from to we believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology represented a reasonable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
the cumulative value of the r d projects we acquired from gilead was divided between the three principal projects  osi phase ii  osi phase i  and osi l phase i 
value was assigned to each program million to osi  million to osi  million to osi l based on the assessment of estimated value at the date of acquisition 
as of september   the technological feasibility of these three projects had not yet been reached 
for each project  we need to successfully complete a series of clinical trials and to receive fda or other regulatory approvals prior to commercialization 
our current estimates of the required investments for the overall development and registration for these next generation cytotoxic drugs range from to million per drug 
there can be no assurances that any of these projects will ever reach feasibility or develop into products that can be marketed profitably  nor can there be assurance we will be able to develop and commercialize these products prior to the development of comparable products by our competitors 
if it is determined that it is not cost beneficial to pursue the further development of any of these projects  we may discontinue such further development of certain or all of these projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increased expenses for additional management and administrative personnel and consultants  as well as an increase in facility and information technology expenses and other professional fees associated with our expansion  corporate development and governance activities 
the increase was also due to increased commercialization and marketing costs relating to tarceva tm which are shared with genentech in accordance with the osi genentech agreement 
consulting expenses include stock options granted to non r d consultants in connection with their consulting arrangements which resulted in  in compensation expenses in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively steady during fiscal with an increase in commercialization and marketing cost as we expand our commercial operations in preparation for the launch of tarceva tm and other development programs 
during fiscal  we made the strategic decision to i close our birmingham  england facility and relocate our birmingham personnel to our new oxford  england facilities as a result of the acquisition of assets from british biotech  and ii close our tarrytown  new york facility and relocate the tarrytown  new york personnel to our new research facility in farmingdale  new york 
the estimated cost of closing these facilities of million was accrued as of september   of which million was included in r d expenses and  in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included in the closing costs were amounts associated with severance for employees who would not be relocated  the lease cost from the anticipated closing date through the lease termination date and the value of related leasehold improvements and other capital items which were not being relocated 
amortization of intangibles of million were primarily related to the amortization of the capitalized workforce and library license acquired from british biotech in september other income and expense net investment income decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments and to less funds available for investment 
interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the interest expense incurred on the convertible senior subordinated notes issued in february see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  a portion of which were retired in august and september the convertible senior subordinated notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on february  for fiscal and  other expenses net were approximately million and  respectively 
included in fiscal was the amortization of debt issuance costs of  and a charge of  related to the writedown of our investment in a privately owned healthcare information company see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
with respect to the early retirement of these notes  we recognized a net gain of million in fiscal representing the difference between the purchase price of million and the aggregate principal of million and related accrued interest less the writedown of million of related debt issuance costs see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also in fiscal  we recognized the million contingent payment received from the bayer corporation in december  in connection with the sale of the diagnostic business in november see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal results of operations our fiscal net loss of million increased million or compared to our fiscal net loss of million 
this increase was primarily related to the launch of the development program associated with tarceva tm  an increased focus on our proprietary research and the closing and consolidation of certain facilities 
the increase in net loss was partially offset by the recognition of million of the upfront fees from genentech and roche see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and higher interest income resulting from increased funds available for investment as more fully discussed in other income and expense below 
included in the fiscal net loss was a non cash charge of million related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the recognition of upfront fees upon the adoption of sab 
no 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the net effect of this change in accounting principle  the fiscal net loss would have been million  or 
per share 
revenues total revenues of million in fiscal decreased million or compared to fiscal due to the focus of our business away from collaborative based to independent drug discovery and development 
total collaborative program revenues of million in fiscal decreased approximately million or compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the conclusion of our funded collaborations with aventis in september  solvay in december  and pfizer in april these decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from the tanabe collaboration 
license and related revenues of million in fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal this increase was due to the recognition of upfront fees received from genentech and roche of million see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
 we were recognizing the million received from genentech and roche evenly over the expected three year development phase of our agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the expected term was changed to four years to reflect our revised estimate of the term of the continued involvement in the research and development efforts under the alliance 
the revision was a result of the review of the current research data available  current developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the development involvement 
the fiscal increase was offset by a one time technology access fee of million from tanabe recognized in fiscal in connection with a change in accounting principle effective october  see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to comply with the provisions of sab no 
 we will recognize this previously recognized technology access fee over the expected term of the agreement  resulting in approximately  in revenue recognition in fiscal assuming the technology access fee received from tanabe had been recognized over the term of the agreement in fiscal  total revenues would have been million in fiscal other revenues of  in fiscal decreased  or compared to fiscal this decrease related to a decrease in sales of products and services derived from pharmaceutical services of osi pharmaceuticals uk ltd  our uk subsidiary  as we shifted in focus from external programs to internal programs 
this decrease was also due to a decrease in our revenues from research relating to governmental and private research grants 
expenses operating expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses primarily included i research and development expenses  which include expenses related to the development of our lead clinical candidate tarceva tm  and proprietary and collaborative based research expenses  ii selling  general and administrative expenses  and iii amortization of intangibles 
research and development expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was related primarily to increased costs associated with i the clinical development of tarceva tm under our tripartite agreement with genentech and roche  ii increased investments in our proprietary drug discovery programs  including cancer  diabetes  and other new opportunities arising from our existing research and development programs  and iii consolidating laboratory facilities 
these increases were offset by a shift of collaborative based research expenses from aventis  solvay  and pfizer to independent based drug discovery efforts and a reduction in certain stock option based compensation charges in comparison to the prior year 
as discussed in the comparison of fiscal to fiscal expenses section above  on august   the board of directors granted non qualified stock options to purchase up to  common shares to our then new president and head of research and development 
the granting of these options resulted in a compensation charge of million in fiscal and deferred compensation of million as of september   which was to be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
in fiscal  million of this deferred compensation was recognized as compensation expense 
a significant portion of this compensation expense was due to the high volatility of the price of our common stock between the grant date and the measurement date 
in addition  in accordance with eitf issue  other stock options granted to non employees in connection with their consulting arrangements resulted in the recognition of million and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and deferred compensation of million and million as of september  and  respectively 
also included in r d expenses in fiscal was million relating to the closing of the birmingham  england and tarrytown  new york facilities  as discussed in the comparison of fiscal to fiscal section above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increased expenses for additional management and administrative personnel and consultants  as well as an increase in facility expenses and other professional fees associated with our expansion and corporate development activities 
consulting expenses included stock options granted to non r d consultants in connection with their consulting arrangements which resulted in  in compensation expense in fiscal compared to  in compensation expenses in fiscal also included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was  relating to the closing of the birmingham  england and tarrytown  new york facilities  as discussed in the comparison of fiscal to fiscal expenses section above 
amortization of intangibles in fiscal primarily represented amortization of goodwill from the acquisition of aston  which was fully amortized as of september  other income and expense net investment income increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was largely due to investment of funds generated from i a private sale of common stock to genentech and roche in january  and ii the underwritten public offering of our common stock in november in fiscal  we recorded a gain of million relating to the sale of our diagnostics business unit to bayer in november liquidity and capital resources at september   working capital  representing primarily cash  cash equivalents  and restricted and unrestricted short term investments  aggregated million compared to million at september  this decrease of million resulted primarily from the net cash paid for the acquisition of gilead s oncology assets in december and our net operating cash burn for the year 
this decrease was offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes in february  less the early retirement of a portion of the notes in august and september and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on december   we acquired certain assets from gilead pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated as of november  the assets purchased include a a pipeline of three clinical oncology candidates  b related intellectual property  and c rights to gilead s leased facilities located in boulder  colorado  as well as leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets 
in connection with the acquisition  we retained gilead employees 
the results of operations of the acquired gilead oncology assets have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since the date of closing 
in consideration for the assets  we paid million in cash  which includes professional fees and the assumption of certain liabilities  and issued  shares of common stock  valued at million 
we are obligated to pay contingent consideration of up to an additional million in either cash or a combination of cash and common stock  at our option  upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development of osi additionally  we assumed certain royalty and milestone obligations to third parties in connection with the oncology candidates acquired as part of the acquisition 
on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on february  we pledged million of us government securities which will be sufficient to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time before february  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
upon any such early redemption  we are required to pay interest that would have been due through february  we may also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after february  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all of the notes  or a portion thereof  not previously called for redemption at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes purchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we may elect to pay the purchase price in common stock instead of cash 
accordingly  our liquidity position would not be affected by such a call by the holders of the notes if we elect to pay the purchase price in stock 
the number of shares of common stock a holder would receive would equal the repurchase price divided by of the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the five trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the repurchase date 
if all or any portion of the notes have not been converted into common stock prior to their maturity date of february   we will be required to pay  in cash  the outstanding principal amount of the notes plus any accrued but unpaid interest 
this could have a significant impact on our liquidity depending on our cash position at the time of maturity 
if we do not have sufficient cash to repay the debt  we may need to borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in order to meet our debt obligations 
in august and september  we retired a total of million in principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including accrued interest of  the difference between the purchase price and the principal amount of the notes retired and accrued interest resulted in a net gain on the early retirement of the notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately million net of the write off of related debt issuance cost 
should conditions warrant  we may from time to time continue to enter the market to repurchase additional notes 
we expect to incur continued losses over the next several years as we continue our investment in tarceva tm and other product candidates in our pipeline 
the major expenses associated with the broad based phase iii development program for tarceva tm are expected to occur in and  as a result  we expect our operating expenses and cash burn to increase in fiscal beyond fiscal  as the tarceva tm development expenses begin to wind down  we expect a lower operating expense and cash burn base which we will maintain until a successful tarceva tm market launch 
we have established a goal of achieving profitability and positive cash flow within to months of a successful market launch of tarceva tm 
although we believe that we have sufficient cash for operations for the next few years  if the market launch of tarceva tm is delayed or if tarceva tm does not receive fda approval or if the approval process is delayed or takes longer than expected  such events could have a negative impact on our liquidity position  assuming our current cash burn 
to achieve profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and products  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  secure required regulatory approvals and obtain adequate assistance to successfully manufacture  introduce and market such technologies and products 
the ability and time required to reach profitability is uncertain 
we believe that our existing cash resources provide a strong financial base from which to fund our operations and capital requirements for at least the next several years 
commitments and contingencies our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our senior subordinated convertible debt and our facility leases 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands thereafter total contractual obligations senior convertible debt a        operating leases        construction commitments loans payable b total contractual obligations        a includes interest payments at a rate of per annum 
b includes interest payments other significant commitments and contingencies include the following we are committed to share equally with genentech and roche certain global development costs of tarceva tm 
in connection with the acquisition of certain of gilead s oncology assets in december  we are obligated to pay up to an additional million in either cash  common stock or a combination of cash and common stock upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development of osi  the most advanced of gilead s oncology product candidates acquired by us 
under agreements with external clinical research organizations  or cros  over the next to months we will continue to incur expenses relating to the progress of tarceva tm clinical trials 
these disbursements can be based upon the achievement of certain milestones  patient enrollment  services rendered or as expenses are incurred by the cros 
in connection with our strategic decision to close down our birmingham  england facility  we expect to pay approximately  in non cancelable lease exit costs 
we have a retirement plan which provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to eligible employees  board members and qualified dependents 
eligibility is determined based on age and years of service 
we have accrued postretirement benefit costs of approximately million at september  under certain collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies and educational institutions  we are required to pay royalties and or milestones upon the successful development and commercialization of products 
under certain license agreements  we are required to pay license fees for the use of technologies and products in our research and development activities 
we entered into a letter of credit with a commercial bank in relation to one of our facilities

 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all future business combinations 
it specifies the criteria which intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet in order to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
and no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   however  both of these statements were effective for acquisitions and other intangibles acquired on or after july  we adopted the applicable provisions of these statements for the accounting of the gilead and the british biotech acquisitions  which both occurred after july  upon full adoption of these standards in fiscal  we will evaluate our existing intangible assets that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition apart from goodwill 
we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
in addition  we will be required to test goodwill and  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of the acquisition of certain assets from gilead on december   we have million in goodwill as of september  which  in accordance with sfas no 
 is not amortized and identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million 
as of september   we had goodwill which was fully amortized and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which supercedes sfas no 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  rescinds sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item and amends sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
we adopted sfas no 
effective april   which was the beginning of the fiscal quarter in which this statement was issued 
as a result  we did not classify the net gain of million realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year from the early retirement of a portion of the our notes as an extraordinary item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  under safs no 
 a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity must only be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under the previous guidance of eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we recognized a liability for an exit or disposal activity cost at the date of our commitment 
if we were to commit to further exit or disposal activities subsequent to the effective date  we would be subject to the new rules regarding expense recognition 
forward looking statements a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in item business and elsewhere in this report that are not historical or current facts deal with potential future circumstances and developments 
the discussion of these matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  and these discussions may materially differ from our actual future experience involving any one or more of these matters and subject areas 
these forward looking statements are also subject generally to the other risks and uncertainties that are described in this report in item business cautionary factors that may affect future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio of debt securities  to the fair value of equity instruments held and to foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity 
with respect to the convertible senior subordinated notes  we pledged million of us government securities restricted investment securities with maturities at various dates through november upon maturity  the proceeds of the restricted investment securities will be sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments on the convertible senior subordinated notes when due see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we consider our restricted investment securities to be held to maturity  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are reported at their amortized cost  which includes the direct costs to acquire the securities  plus the amortization of any discount or premium  and accrued interest earned on the securities 
our limited investments in certain biotechnology companies are carried on the equity method or cost method of accounting using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
other than temporary losses are recorded against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
it is uncertain whether other than temporary losses will be material to our results of operations in the future 
we do not currently hedge these exposures 
we at times minimize risk by hedging the foreign currency exchange rates exposure through forward contracts as more fully described in note d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we did not have any forward foreign exchange contracts as of september  at september   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained an investment portfolio containing financial instruments of which approximately have original maturities of less than months 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of government and government agency obligations and corporate obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical change in interest rates during the year ended september  would have resulted in approximately a million change in our net loss 
we have not used or held derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our long term debt totaled approximately million at september  and was primarily comprised of the convertible senior subordinated notes 
the convertible senior subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates which may make the conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes to common stock beneficial to the convertible senior subordinated notes holders 
conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes would have a dilutive effect on any future earnings and book value per common share
