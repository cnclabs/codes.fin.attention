item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company has three reportable segments  automated data systems ads  integrated production systems ips and advanced manufacturing equipment ame 
segments are determined principally on the basis of their products and services 
the ads segment comprises the company s wholly owned subsidiary intermec technologies corporation intermec 
the ips segment comprises the lamb machining systems division  the lamb body assembly systems division and the landis grinding systems division 
the ame segment comprises the cincinnati machine division 
for evaluation purposes  the company aggregates the ips and ame reportable segments into the industrial automation systems ias business 
sales and service revenues and segment operating profit loss for the years ended december   and were as follows millions of dollars year ended december  sales and service revenues automated data systems a a industrial automation systems integrated production systems advanced manufacturing equipment total sales and service revenues    segment operating profit loss b automated data systems a a industrial automation systems integrated production systems advanced manufacturing equipment total segment operating profit loss a includes amtech through june b excludes goodwill impairment  special charges and other income 
year ended december  compared to sales and service revenues and segment operating profit loss total sales and service revenues for the year ended december  were  million  a decrease of million  or  compared with the prior year 
before goodwill impairment  special charges and other income  the company reported total segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to total segment operating loss of million for the prior year 
results for include the ads segment s amtech transportation systems operations amtech which were sold in june automated data systems ads segment revenues were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  which included amtech revenues of million 
excluding amtech  ads revenues decreased from the prior year 
the decrease is due to weakness in the ads segment s markets with of the decline attributable to north america 
by product line  the largest percentage decrease occurred for printer media products  followed by systems solutions products  and service 
during the second quarter  the company settled a dispute with compaq computer corporation regarding the company s battery power management patents 
accordingly  ads revenues for the year ended december  include significant royalty income 
the specific terms of the settlement are confidential 
the ads segment reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december   before goodwill impairment and special charges  compared to an operating loss of million for the prior year 
the operating loss for includes fourth quarter severance charges of million related to a reduction in intermec s global workforce 
the improvement in operating profit reflects significant reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses and higher product and service gross margin percentages  offset partially by the impact on operating profit due to the lower revenue level 
compared to  product and service gross margins have improved by approximately two percentage points largely as a result of efficiencies within the service organization 
the results reflect significant gross margin contributed by royalties 
during  the ads segment recorded a third quarter charge for non cash goodwill and other long lived asset impairments of million and a fourth quarter charge for the closure of a facility of million 
see discussion under the heading goodwill impairment and special charges below 
integrated production systems ips segment revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or from the prior year 
the revenue decline reflects a global decline in capital spending primarily by the north american automotive industry 
despite the revenue declines  operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
in general  this improvement reflects better overall contract margins and an improved balance of business between the segment s us and us grinding operations 
high installation and integration costs in for the ips us operations were substantially reduced in resulting in higher operating margins for ips core us operations 
however  the benefit was offset by losses incurred by other non core us operations 
these non core operations were closed in ips operating profit for also reflects significant improvement at its european operations driven by higher sales volume for the uk grinding operations and substantially reduced losses for its german subsidiary 
ips operating profit for includes inventory and accounts receivable write downs of million relating to closed operations and fourth quarter severance charges of million related to the reduction in its north american workforce 
revenue declines have necessitated cost reduction actions 
during  the ips segment closed three underperforming operations and one underutilized facility 
these actions resulted in aggregate charges of million  including million of impaired goodwill 
see discussion under the heading goodwill impairment and special charges below 
integrated production systems backlog decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decline in backlog is driven largely by major weakness in capital spending by the north american automotive and related customers 
the company does not expect these conditions to improve in the near term  indicating projected lower ips revenue performance for advanced manufacturing equipment ame revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues reflects continued weakness in the domestic aerospace related and general machine tool markets 
before goodwill impairment and special charges  the segment reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million for the prior year 
the operating losses for and include fourth quarter severance charges of million and million  respectively  related to reductions in the segment s us workforce 
ame revenues continue a trend of decline 
weak domestic machine tool markets  particularly the aerospace related component  were further impacted by the declining national economy 
revenue declines and the related reduction in contributed gross margin have resulted in increased operating losses in backlog decreased to million at december  from million at december  during the third quarter  the ame segment recorded non cash goodwill and other long lived assets impairments of million 
during the fourth quarter  the segment recorded charges of million to exit certain of its vertically integrated manufacturing activities and consolidate facilities 
these amounts are reported as goodwill impairment and special charges 
see discussion under the heading goodwill impairment and special charges below 
the company does not expect near term improvement in the ame revenue trend  resulting in projected lower revenues for costs and expenses cost of sales and service decreased million to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  cost of sales and service as a percentage of sales improved to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in cost of sales reflects the lower sales volume in and improved gross margins for both the ads and ips segments 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the reductions in sg a are principally the result of lower intermec spending 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year reflects the impact of lower capital expenditures and the write off of goodwill and long lived assets in net interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower outstanding debt during the year  partially offset by the effect of higher interest rates on the company s outstanding borrowings 
goodwill impairment and special charges goodwill and long lived asset impairment 
in the third quarter  growing evidence of a recessionary environment  intensified by the september attacks  caused the company to have a less favorable revenue outlook 
accordingly  the company assessed whether these effects resulted in impairment of its goodwill and long lived assets to be held and used 
due primarily to this poor market outlook and uncertainty as to its impact on the company s results  the company recorded non cash charges to write off remaining goodwill associated with its ads and ame segments of million and million  respectively 
additional non cash charges of million and million were recorded to reduce the book value of ads and ame property  plant and equipment  respectively  to their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair value of these long lived assets  including goodwill  was computed based on discounted expected future cash flows from the related operations 
facilities closures and consolidations 
throughout  the company undertook a series of actions to close underutilized or underperforming operations and facilities 
in connection with these actions  related goodwill and long lived assets were tested for impairment on a to be disposed of basis 
the fair value of long lived assets to be disposed of was estimated based on the current market value of similar assets 
these actions resulted in charges for severance  plant closure costs  and impairment of long lived assets as follows 
during the second quarter  the ips segment initiated closure of substantially all of its r b machine tool company and mm e inc facilities 
certain remaining manufacturing activities were consolidated into other ips units 
this action  which was substantially complete at december   resulted in the accrual of severance costs for employees totaling million and other plant closure costs of million 
the related review of goodwill and long lived assets for impairment resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
the estimated fair value of goodwill was computed based on discounted expected future cash flows from remaining operations 
during the third quarter of  the ips segment initiated closure of its underutilized hebron kentucky facility 
this action  which was substantially complete as of december   resulted in the accrual of severance costs for employees totaling million and other plant closure costs of million 
during the fourth quarter  the ips segment initiated closure of its modern prototype operations 
this action  which was substantially complete at december   resulted in the accrual of severance costs for employees totaling million and other plant closure costs of million 
the related review of long lived assets to be disposed of for impairment resulted in property  plant and equipment impairment charges of million 
during the fourth quarter  the ame segment initiated a plan to reduce vertical integration in its manufacturing processes and consolidate plant facilities 
the plan includes outsourcing of certain manufacturing activities  termination of employees  and the disposition of plant and equipment by a combination of sale and abandonment 
this action  which is expected to be substantially complete by december   resulted in the accrual of severance costs for employees totaling million and other plant closure costs of million 
as of december   amounts paid and charged against these accruals were not material 
the related review of long lived assets to be disposed of for impairment resulted in plant and equipment impairment charges of million 
during the fourth quarter  the ads segment initiated a plan to eliminate certain engineering activities  terminate related employees and close a leased facility 
this action  which is expected to be complete by december   resulted in the accrual of severance costs for employees totaling million and lease termination and other closure costs of million 
as of december   amounts paid and charged against these accruals were not material 
other income other income for the year ended december  represents the second quarter gain of million related to the reversion of surplus pension plan assets see discussion under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
other income for the year ended december  of million represents the gain from the sale of the ads segment s amtech transportation systems operations 
income taxes income taxes for the year ended december  reflects the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment and nondeductible excise taxes on the reversion of surplus pension plan assets 
year ended december  compared to sales and service revenues and segment operating profit loss total sales and service revenues for the year ended december  were  million  a decrease of million  or  compared with the prior year 
the company reported total segment operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to total segment operating profit of million for the prior year 
automated data systems ads segment sales decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
the decrease in revenue reflects the sale of the segment s amtech operations in june and lower sales volume for the company s intermec subsidiary 
average quarterly revenue for amtech was million 
the intermec sales decline was caused primarily by weakness in the direct store delivery dsd market and sales force disruption as the company s intermec subsidiary shifted from a geographic sales orientation to a named account vertical marketing structure 
as a result  intermec did not participate in the industry s overall market growth 
the ads segment reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to operating profit of million for the prior year 
the significant operating losses during were due primarily to lower intermec gross profits that were insufficient to absorb selling  general and administrative expenses 
intermec gross profits were impacted by lower sales volume and by a shift in the product mix in to products with lower margins 
in addition  actions taken by intermec for workforce reductions  consolidation of manufacturing facilities and sales and field service offices  and product rationalization resulted in fourth quarter adjustments of million 
integrated production systems ips segment revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or from the prior year 
the revenue decline is primarily due to the impact of lower capital spending by domestic automakers and to a lesser extent the impact of currency translation of foreign sales 
related operating profit decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
the ips operating profit decline was attributed to higher installation and integration costs later in for the segment s machining systems operations and foreign losses incurred during the first half of due to unabsorbed costs 
integrated production systems backlog decreased from million at december  to million at december  backlog at the end of was at a record high level and included significant multi year contracts  whereas backlog at december  comprised nearer term deliveries and reflects the slowing of automotive markets 
advanced manufacturing equipment ame revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues reflected continued weakness in the domestic aerospace related general machine tool market 
the segment reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to operating profit of million for the prior year 
the loss for was due primarily to lower domestic sales and backlog levels and the corresponding impact on margins due to unabsorbed fixed costs 
in addition  ame recorded million in employee severance related expenses in the fourth quarter of backlog decreased from million at december  to million at december  costs and expenses cost of sales and service decreased million to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was due to the above mentioned factors contributing to fluctuations in segment operating profit loss  primarily underabsorbed manufacturing overhead  lower sales volume and fourth quarter adjustments 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due to lower selling expenses  primarily at intermec  offset partially by additional costs for accounts receivable securitization 
the company s accounts receivable securitization agreements were in place for the full year in compared to six months in lower revenue levels resulted in sg a  as a percentage of sales  increasing from in to in depreciation and amortization of million for the year ended december  is consistent with million for the prior year  due to no significant net changes in the company s fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets 
net interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower outstanding debt during the year  partially offset by the effect of increased interest rates 
other income other income of million represents a one time gain from the sale of amtech in june the company acquired amtech in june the net assets and results of operations for amtech are not material to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
foreign currency transactions the company is subject to the effects of international currency fluctuations due to the global nature of its operations 
currency transaction net losses of million  million and million are included in cost of sales and service for the years ended december   and it is not possible to predict the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations beyond the near term because revenues generated from particular foreign jurisdictions vary widely over time 
for fiscal year  the company derived approximately of its revenues from non us customers 
at december   long lived assets attributable to foreign countries comprised of total assets 
as the largest components of these foreign assets are attributable to european nations  primarily the united kingdom  germany  and sweden  the exposure of long lived assets to foreign currency fluctuations or expropriations is not significant 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  total debt decreased from million at december  to million at december  net debt  defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  was reduced to million at december  from million at december  the million decrease in net debt reflects million of cash received from the reversion of surplus pension plan assets and million of cash flow generated from normal operations  offset by cash used of million to terminate the company s account receivable securitization agreements 
on july   the company entered into two secured long term credit facilities with aggregate committed capacity of up to million a million asset based revolving credit facility the revolving facility and a million secured term loan the term loan 
in conjunction with the new facilities  the company refinanced and terminated its million secured credit facility and related agreements 
the revolving facility is maintained with a syndicate of lenders and matures on july  borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base calculation  as defined in the agreement  based on eligible levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
the revolving facility is secured by a junior lien on the real estate  machinery and equipment of the company and its domestic subsidiaries and a senior lien on substantially all of the other assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations on liens contained in the indenture governing the company s outstanding senior notes in the principal amount of million 
the company may borrow at the base rate or the libor rate  each as defined in the agreement  plus an applicable margin 
the revolving facility places restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries  including limits on capital expenditures  liens  investments  sale or pledge of assets  prepayment of debt  sale and leaseback transactions  dividend payments  and incurrence of debt or guarantees 
financial covenants include minimum levels of domestic ebitda  fixed charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth  each as defined in the agreement 
on march   the financial covenants of the revolving facility and term loan were amended 
effective for the year  the amendments remove the fixed charge coverage test and add a free cash flow test  as defined in the amendments 
the free cash flow test is only applicable if average availability on the revolving facility is less than million and outstanding borrowings on the revolving facility exceed million 
provisions were added  applicable for the remaining term of the revolving facility  to maintain minimum availability of million and remove the minimum domestic ebitda test 
based on projected results of operations  management believes the company will be in compliance with the financial covenants of its revolving facility and term loan 
the term loan was obtained from a syndicate of lenders and is secured by a senior lien on the real estate  machinery and equipment of the company and its domestic subsidiaries and a junior lien on substantially all of the other assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations on liens contained in the indenture governing the company s outstanding senior notes in the principal amount of million 
monthly interest payments are based on the libor rate plus an applicable margin  as defined in the agreement 
the principal matures on july  net proceeds from the sale of real estate  machinery and equipment of the company and its domestic subsidiaries must be applied to the reduction of the term loan principal  subject to certain exceptions as defined in the agreement 
other restrictions and financial covenants  including the march  amendment  contained in the term loan are consistent with those in the revolving facility 
on september   certain of the company s uk subsidiaries collectively  the borrower entered into a secured revolving credit facility and related secured overdraft facility collectively  the uk facility 
the uk facility matures on september  and may be extended in one year increments at the discretion of the lender 
the uk facility has committed capacity of up to million and is secured by substantially all the assets of the borrower 
borrowing availability  as defined in the agreement  is based on property and eligible levels of accounts receivable 
the company may borrow at the libor rate  as defined in the agreement  plus an applicable margin 
the uk facility places restrictions on the borrower  including limits on liens  investments  sale or pledge of assets  dividend payments  and incurrence of debt or guarantees 
net proceeds from the sale of real estate  machinery and equipment of the borrower must be applied to the reduction of any outstanding loan balance 
the uk facility includes cross default provisions to the financial covenants included in the company s revolving facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the term loan at an annual interest rate of  and no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving facility or the uk facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the financial convenants of each of these agreements 
in  the company completed a partial settlement of its us defined benefit pension plan obligations through the purchase of nonparticipating annuity contracts 
in connection with the settlement  surplus plan assets of million reverted to the company 
after applicable excise and income taxes  the company received net cash of million and real estate with a fair value of million 
the settlement resulted in a pension reversion book gain of million 
after excise taxes  the pension reversion book gain was million and is reported as other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company also reduced the related prepaid pension asset in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination of benefits 
this transaction will result in a significant change from the historical rate of pension income 
the net impact for is expected to be an approximately million reduction in pre tax earnings 
for the period from june  to february   the company sold interests in a revolving pool of its trade accounts receivable to a financial institution which issues short term debt backed by receivables acquired in similar transactions 
in connection with the company s refinancing activities  on february   these arrangements were terminated and the company repurchased the financial institution s interest in the pool of trade receivables for approximately million in cash 
management believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with projected cash flow from operations will provide adequate funding to meet its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
projected cash flow from operations are largely based on the company s revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flow from operations could be positively or negatively impacted 
additional sources of liquidity for the company include the revolving credit facility and the uk facility 
net of outstanding letters of credit and limitations on minimum availability  the company had borrowing capacity of million under the revolving facility and million under the uk facility  each as of march  contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual commitments as of december  millions of dollars 
these commitments are discussed in the indicated notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term obligations note b operating leases note d total contractual obligations in addition  the company had aggregate off balance sheet guarantees and letter of credit reimbursement agreements of million at december  these items relate to the company s performance on operating contracts with customers and generally expire within one year 
inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates and has not had a significant impact upon the results of its operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
changes in the financial condition of the company s customers could result in upward or downward adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory obsolescence 
the company writes down its inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if written off inventory is sold 
deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates the likelihood of recovering its deferred tax assets and the adequacy of the related valuation allowance by estimating sources of taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
goodwill and long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and long lived assets by comparing the carrying value of asset groups to their undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the carrying value exceeds undiscounted expected future cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
if management s estimates of expected future cash flows decrease  additional impairment losses could be recorded 
pensions and postretirement benefits 
accounting for pensions and post retirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  assumptions about investment returns  discount rates  inflation  mortality  turnover and medical coverage costs are extensively used 
material differences between these assumptions and actual results could positively or negatively impact future results of operations 
revenue recognition 
the ips and ame segments recognize a significant portion of revenue and related profit as work progresses on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
the company uses this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made throughout the performance of the contracts 
since financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  recognized revenues and profits are subject to increase or decrease as the contract progresses to completion 
warranties 
the company records a liability and expense for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
these estimates are based primarily on the company s historical warranty experience rates 
should the actual cost of product warranties differ  warranty liabilities could be adjusted upward or downward 
contingencies 
the company assesses its exposure to loss contingencies including environmental  legal and income tax matters and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a loss contingency differs from management s estimates  results of operations could be adjusted upward or downward 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas discontinues the pooling of interests method for business combinations effective july  and establishes new criteria for distinguishing goodwill and other intangibles acquired 
sfas provides guidance on post acquisition accounting for goodwill and intangibles  including the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  in favor of periodic impairment testing 
goodwill amortization for the year ended december  was million 
on january   the company adopted sfas and ceased amortization of its goodwill balances 
the company has completed the transitional fair value based impairment test and determined that none of the recorded goodwill was impaired 
fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow model 
sfas also requires that intangible assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill be reclassified 
no reclassification to goodwill was required as of january  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated asset retirement costs 
the statement becomes effective for the company on january  the company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the adoption of this standard on january  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from its short term and long term borrowings and to foreign exchange rate risk with respect to its foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
interest rates as of december   the company s outstanding borrowings comprised million in fixed rate debentures  a million variable rate term loan  and an million variable rate industrial revenue bond 
in addition  the company had variable rate facilities with no outstanding borrowings comprised of the revolving facility and the uk facility 
net of outstanding letters of credit and limitations on minimum availability  the company had borrowing capacity of million under the revolving facility and million under the uk facility  each as of march  see discussion of the company s credit facilities under the heading liquidity and capital resources in item of this annual report and in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents principal cash flows and interest rates by maturity dates and the fair values of the company s borrowings as of december  fair values for fixed rate borrowings have been determined based on recent market trade values 
the fair values for variable rate borrowings approximate their carrying value 
variable interest rates disclosed represent the rates on the borrowing at december  debt total fair value fixed rate interest rate variable rate interest rate foreign exchange rates due to its global operations  the company s cash flow and earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when appropriate  the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates by entering into short term foreign currency exchange contracts 
as of december   the company held short term contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency cash flows with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the company does not enter into any foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
contracts that effectively meet risk reduction and correlation criteria are accounted for as hedges and  accordingly  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are deferred in the cost basis of the underlying transaction 
in those circumstances when it is not appropriate to account for contracts as hedges  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded currently in earnings 
a hypothetical change in the relevant currency rates at december  would not result in a material gain or loss 
additionally  any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  should be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item
