item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of continuing operations the results of continuing operations reflect primarily the results of minntech  medivators and carsen 
reference is made to i the discontinuance of the company s consumer products business  as more fully described in item  business  and in note to the consolidated financial statements  ii the impact on the company s results of operations of a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar during fiscal compared with fiscal and during fiscal compared with fiscal decrease in value of approximately during each of the above periods  iii critical accounting policies of the company  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  iv  additional shares issued in connection with a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid to stockholders in may  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and v the company s acquisition of minntech in september  as more fully described in item  business  and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
minntech is reflected in the company s results of operations for the portion of fiscal subsequent to its acquisition on september   and is not reflected in the results of operations for fiscal or fiscal the acquisition of minntech has added two new operating segments to the company  dialysis products and filtration and separation products 
additionally  minntech also contributes to the company s product service operating segment 
discussion herein of the company s pre existing businesses refers to the operations of cantel  carsen and medivators  but excluding the impact of the minntech acquisition 
the following table gives information as to the net sales and the percentage to the total net sales accounted for by each operating segment of the company 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands dialysis products  endoscopy and surgical products    endoscope reprocessing products    filtration and separation products  scientific products    product service    elimination of inter company sales of endoscope reprocessing products endoscopy and surgical products was formerly described as medical products  and endoscope reprocessing products was formerly described as infection control products 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal net sales contributed by minntech for fiscal were  without the minntech acquisition  net sales of the company s pre existing businesses would have decreased by  or  to  for fiscal net sales were adversely impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
the decrease in sales of the company s pre existing businesses was attributable to the decreased sales of endoscopy and surgical products  partially offset by an increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and product service 
the decrease in sales of endoscopy and surgical products was due to a decrease in demand  including the adverse impact of healthcare funding issues in canada as well as intensified competition which the company expects to continue 
healthcare funding in canada is dependent upon governmental appropriations and the company cannot ascertain what impact the funding situation will have on future sales of endoscopy and surgical products and scientific products 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products was primarily due to an increase in demand in the united states 
the increase in sales of product service was primarily due to an increase in demand and marketshare in canada 
the company believes that it has the opportunity to continue increasing its marketshare in the endoscope reprocessing segment 
the majority of its product service segment is located in canada where the company s marketshare in its flexible endoscope service business is substantial  therefore  growth opportunities for its existing service business may be limited without the addition of new product servicing opportunities 
gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by minntech for fiscal was  without the impact of the minntech acquisition  gross profit of the company s pre existing businesses would have decreased by  or  to  for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal during fiscal  gross profit was adversely impacted by a  charge to cost of sales related to the sale of inventories which carried a step up in value recorded as a result of purchase accounting  such charge reduced gross profit percentage by for fiscal minntech s gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal  without the impact of the minntech acquisition  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal would have been 
the lower gross profit percentage from the company s pre existing businesses for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was primarily attributable to the adverse impact of a weaker canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  since the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars  a higher gross profit percentage in due to a buy in of endoscopes prior to receiving a supplier price increase such endoscopes were sold during fiscal  increased competition in endoscopy and surgical products  and sales mix associated with endoscope reprocessing products and product service  including the increased manufacturing and warranty costs associated with the company s new dsd endoscope reprocessing unit 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal without the impact of the minntech acquisition  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been for fiscal the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales from the company s pre existing businesses was primarily attributable to lower than expected sales at carsen  an increase in personnel at carsen and expanded marketing efforts to support medivators domestic sales of endoscope reprocessing products 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal general and administrative expenses incurred by minntech for fiscal were  without the minntech acquisition  general and administrative expenses of the company s pre existing businesses would have increased by  for fiscal  principally due to the addition of business development personnel and related expenses and costs associated with the company s listing of its common stock on the new york stock exchange 
research and development expenses increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal research and development expenses incurred by minntech for fiscal were  without the minntech acquisition  research and development expenses of the company s pre existing businesses would have increased by  for fiscal  principally due to costs related to medivators new endoscope reprocessing unit 
the company anticipates research and development expenses to increase in fiscal primarily due to costs associated with two specific projects  however  such increase is not expected to exceed relative to the fiscal level of research and development expenses assuming that minntech had been included in the company s results of operations for all of fiscal 
interest expense was  for fiscal  compared with interest income of  for fiscal this change in interest was attributable to the company s borrowings under its new credit facilities entered into during september to fund a portion of the minntech acquisition 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the consolidated effective tax rate on operations was and for fiscal and  respectively 
in conjunction with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of minntech  cantel eliminated the valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets related to the nols accumulated in the united states 
therefore  for all periods subsequent to september   the company has provided in its results of operations income tax expense for its united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of us federal income taxes will reflect the benefits of the utilization of the nols 
the company s results of operations for fiscal also reflect income tax expense for its international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
such international subsidiaries include the company s subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands and japan  which had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately  and  respectively 
the operations of the company s subsidiaries in the netherlands and japan were part of the minntech acquisition and are therefore included in the company s results of operations only since september  for fiscal  income taxes consist primarily of taxes imposed on the company s canadian subsidiary which had an effective tax rate of approximately 
the consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than the canadian effective tax rate due to the fact that income generated by the united states operations was substantially offset by federal tax benefits resulting from the utilization of nols 
in fiscal  the company expects a reduction in its canadian effective tax rate due to enacted reductions in both canadian federal and provincial income tax rates 
however  the company s overall effective tax rate for fiscal is subject to the progressive tax rate structure in the netherlands  as well as changes caused by the geographic mix of pretax income 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal net sales were adversely impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
this increase in net sales was attributable to the increased sales of the company s endoscopy and surgical products  endoscope reprocessing products and product service business segments 
for fiscal  the increased sales of endoscopy and surgical products were due primarily to an increase in demand  a portion of which was attributable to the introduction of new flexible endoscopy products  and selling price increases 
the increased sales of endoscope reprocessing products were primarily attributable to an increase in demand for endoscope reprocessing products in the united states 
the increased sales of product service were primarily attributable to an increase in demand and selling price increases 
gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal gross profit was adversely impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s gross profit using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the higher gross profit percentage for fiscal was primarily attributable to a buy in of endoscopes prior to receiving a supplier price increase  which endoscopes were sold during fiscal  selling price increases in endoscopy and surgical products and product service  and favorable sales mix associated with product service and scientific products 
partially offsetting these increases in gross profit percentage was the adverse impact of a weaker canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  since the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the effect of the increased sales against the fixed portion of selling expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the increase reflects additional personnel and increases in incentive compensation  profit sharing contributions  rent and amortization of computer software 
research and development expenses increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional personnel required for new products including the dsd and rapicide tm 
interest income was  in fiscal  compared with interest expense of  in fiscal this change in interest was attributable to interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents during fiscal  compared with interest expense on outstanding borrowings during fiscal income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal income taxes consist primarily of taxes imposed on the company s canadian operations 
the effective tax rate on canadian operations was and for fiscal and  respectively

net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal  compared with net cash provided by investing activities of  in fiscal and net cash used in investing activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisition of minntech and capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the discontinued operations  partially offset by purchases of available for sale securities  professional fees related to the minntech acquisition such fees are included within other  net and capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in the net assets related to the discontinued operations and capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the company anticipates an increase in the level of its capital expenditures  primarily at minntech 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal  compared with net cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to borrowings under the company s new credit facilities for the minntech acquisition  net of related debt issuance costs  partially offset by repayments under these credit facilities 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to net repayments under a prior credit facility 
at july   the company had a credit facility which provided for i a  revolving credit facility for cantel and medivators  ii a  united states dollars revolving credit facility for carsen and iii a  acquisition facility available to cantel and medivators for permitted acquisitions in the united states 
at july   the company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
in conjunction with the acquisition of minntech on september   the company entered into new credit facilities to fund the financed portion of the cash consideration paid in the merger and costs associated with the merger  as well as to replace the company s existing working capital credit facilities 
the new credit facilities include i a  senior secured amortizing term loan facility from a consortium of us lenders the term loan facility used by cantel to finance a portion of the minntech acquisition  ii a  senior secured revolving credit facility from the us lenders the us revolving credit facility used by cantel to finance a portion of the minntech acquisition as well as being available for future working capital requirements for the us businesses of cantel  including minntech and medivators the us borrowers and iii a  united states dollars senior secured revolving credit facility for carsen the canadian borrower with a canadian bank the canadian revolving credit facility available for carsen s future working capital requirements 
each of the term loan facility  the us revolving credit facility and the canadian revolving credit facility collectively the credit facilities expire on september  borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from 
to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon the company s consolidated ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the base rates associated with the us lenders and the canadian lender were and  respectively  at october   and the libor rates ranged from to at october  the margins applicable to the company s outstanding borrowings at october  are above the lender s base rate and above libor 
in order to protect its interest rate exposure  the company entered into a three year interest rate cap agreement expiring on september  covering  of borrowings under the term loan facility  which caps libor on this portion of outstanding borrowings at 
the credit facilities also provide for fees on the unused portion of such facilities at rates ranging from 
to  depending upon the company s consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda 
the term loan facility and the us revolving credit facility provide for available borrowings based upon percentages of the us borrowers eligible accounts receivable and inventories  require the us borrowers to meet certain financial covenants  are secured by substantially all assets of the us borrowers including a pledge of the stock of minntech and medivators owned by cantel and of the outstanding shares of carsen stock owned by cantel  and are guaranteed by minntech and medivators 
the canadian revolving credit facility provides for available borrowings based upon percentages of the canadian borrower s eligible accounts receivable and inventories  requires the canadian borrower to meet certain financial covenants  and is secured by substantially all assets of the canadian borrower 
on september   the company borrowed  under the term loan facility and  under the us revolving credit facility in connection with the acquisition of minntech 
at july   the company had  outstanding under its credit facilities  including  under the term loan facility 
subsequent to july   the company repaid an additional  under its credit facilities  therefore  at october   the company had  outstanding under its credit facilities  including  under the term loan facility 
amounts repaid by the company under the term loan facility may not be re borrowed 
aggregate annual required maturities of the credit facilities over the next five years and thereafter are as follows year ending july  thereafter total  the amount maturing in fiscal includes the remaining  presently outstanding under the revolving credit facilities since such amount is required to be repaid prior to the expiration date of such facilities 
aggregate future minimum rental commitments at july  under operating leases for property and equipment are as follows year ending july  total rental commitments  the company has determined that it will repatriate minimal amounts of existing and future accumulated profits from its international locations until existing nols are exhausted  which the company has determined to be approximately through fiscal notwithstanding this strategy  the company believes that its current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  including its us operations and the funds available under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon its existing operations  including the payment of remaining liabilities from the minntech acquisition 
at october   approximately  was available under the revolving credit facilities 
during fiscal compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar decreased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect the company s results of operations because the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars 
such currency fluctuations also result in a corresponding change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in canadian dollars 
under the canadian revolving credit facility  carsen has a  united states dollars foreign currency hedging facility which is available to hedge against the impact of such currency fluctuations on purchases of inventories 
total commitments for foreign currency forward contracts under this facility amounted to  united states dollars at october  and cover a portion of the canadian subsidiary s projected purchases of inventories through february the weighted average exchange rate of the forward contracts open at october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
the exchange rate published by the wall street journal on october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
since the acquisition of minntech on september  until the end of fiscal  the value of the euro increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect the company s results of operations because a portion of the net assets of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
during the portion of fiscal subsequent to the minntech acquisition  such strengthening of the euro relative to the united states dollar had an adverse impact upon the company s results of operations 
such currency fluctuations also result in a change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in euros 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar  the company enters into short term contracts to purchase euros forward 
there was one foreign currency forward contract amounting to euro  at october  which covers a portion of the net assets of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars 
such contract expires on october  under its credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
effective august   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  all of the company s foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
recognition of gains and losses related to the canadian hedges is deferred within other comprehensive income until settlement of the underlying commitments  and realized gains and losses are recorded within cost of sales upon settlement 
gains and losses related to the hedging contracts to buy euros forward is immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet  at july  compared to september   the value of the euro increased by approximately compared to the value of the united states dollar  thereby causing a decrease in the negative cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment during such period 
partially offsetting this change was a decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the value of the united states dollar at july  compared to july   which caused an increase to the negative cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment during fiscal the net impact of these currency movements was an overall decrease in the negative cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment during fiscal of  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar since the acquisition of minntech on september  did not have a significant impact upon either the company s results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that the company s japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  earnings and net assets 
as of july   the company had nols for domestic tax reporting purposes of approximately  which expire through july  the valuation allowance related to the company s nols was reversed in connection with the purchase price allocation for the minntech acquisition  based upon an assessment of the combined companies expected future results of operations 
in addition  the company and its foreign subsidiaries cannot file consolidated tax returns for united states income tax purposes 
therefore  the company s nols in the united states cannot be utilized to reduce federal or provincial income taxes payable by the foreign subsidiaries on their taxable income 
this has resulted in the payment of income taxes by the company in canada and the netherlands  notwithstanding nols utilized  or net losses sustained  by the company in the united states 
inflation has not significantly impacted the company s operations 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company continually evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers or when title passes  net of provisions for sales allowances and similar items 
domestic sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment are of a bill and hold nature as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed and the products are shipped to customers 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to the company from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of products which are sold in the ordinary course of the company s business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  the company must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  the company uses historical experience as well as current market information 
deferred tax assets and liabilities the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that the amounts recorded are appropriately stated 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
long lived assets certain of the company s identifiable intangible assets  such as current technology and customer base  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
additionally  the company has recorded goodwill and trademarks and tradenames  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
business combinations during fiscal  the company s acquisition of minntech required significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain of the liabilities are subjective in nature 
these liabilities have been reflected in the purchase accounting based upon the most recent information available  and principally include certain state sales and use tax and state income tax exposures  as well as income tax liabilities related to the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts presently recorded 
other matters the company does not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  acceptance and demand of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the company s ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired and merged businesses and the risks associated with such businesses  and the risks detailed in the company s filings and reports with the securities and exchange commission 
such statements are only predictions  and actual events or results may differ materially from those projected 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
foreign currency market risk a portion of the company s products are imported from the far east and western europe  the company s united states subsidiaries sell a portion of their products outside of the united states  and minntech s netherlands subsidiary sells a portion of its products outside of the european union 
consequently  the company s business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting the united states  canada and the netherlands 
carsen imports a substantial portion of its products from the united states and pays for such products in united states dollars  and carsen s business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
additionally  carsen s financial statements are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an adverse impact in fiscal compared with fiscal  and in fiscal compared with fiscal  upon the company s results of operations and stockholders equity  as described in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial statements of the netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the european union and the united states had an adverse impact in fiscal upon the company s results of operations  as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar since the acquisition of minntech on september  did not have a significant impact upon either the company s results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that the company s japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  earnings and net assets 
interest rate market risk the company has two credit facilities for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
therefore  interest expense is principally affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states and canada 
during fiscal  all of the company s outstanding borrowings were under its united states credit facilities 
in order to protect its interest rate exposure  the company has entered into a three year interest rate cap expiring on september  covering  of borrowings under the term loan facility  which caps libor on this portion of outstanding borrowings at 
at july   the fair value of such interest rate cap is
