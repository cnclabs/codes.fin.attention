in november  we discovered that certain sales orders were invalid 
we undertook an investigation  which determined that the invalid sales orders were limited to software licenses to certain government agencies submitted by one employee in the washington dc office 
as a result  the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in the quarterly reports on form q filed on may  and august  were restated to remove the effect of the invalid sales orders 
to the extent the following discussion and analysis refers to financial results for the period ended december   such discussion and analysis refers to such results as so revised 
overview we provide business intelligence solutions that enable enterprises to win  retain  and grow new customers and improve operational effectiveness 
we develop  market  and support products and services that help businesses collect  analyze  understand  and act on customer and operational information both in batch and in real time 
our products and services provide a way for an organization s employees  customers  and partners to use the internet to examine the internal data they already have and to supplement that data with external  value added information such as demographic  geographic  or other content and data feeds 
we refer to our products as business intelligence solutions because they enable organizations to rapidly make more informed  intelligent decisions and to spread that ability across the enterprise 
recent major developments restructuring in response to challenges in the business environment  in december  our board of directors approved a restructuring program aimed at streamlining its underlying cost structure to better position us for growth and improved operating results 
the reductions came from all areas of the organization and  as of december   the majority of these terminations were completed and resulted in a restructuring charge of million  which consisted of million related to reduction in workforce and million in estimated facility and exit costs that were associated with the closing of two facilities 
the majority of the cost savings is expected to be realized as a result of lower headcount and reduced facility costs 
over time  these cost savings are expected to be partially offset by increased operating expenses to support future growth 
while we believe that our business realignment will assist us in increasing revenues  reducing expenses  and thereby achieving profitability  we cannot assure you that we will achieve these anticipated results 
we may in the future need to take additional actions  including further changes to the business organization  in order to realign the business with anticipated requirements 
if we are not successful in realigning our business to increase revenues and decrease costs  we may never achieve profitability

critical accounting policies sagent s critical accounting policies are as follows 
revenue recognition 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
consolidation of sagent s international operations 
valuation allowances revenue recognition sagent sells its software products directly to our customers and through channel partners such as enterprise software vendors  resellers and distributors 
enterprise software vendors generally integrate our products with their applications and will embed them into their products or resell them with their products 
our other channel partners  principally resellers and distributors  sell our software products to end user customers 
sagent derives its revenue from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to the software products  including consulting  training  software and data updates  technical support and real time marketing services over the internet 
sagent recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop and and generally recognize revenue when  all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery had occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we define each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and the company 
delivery has occurred our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
if undelivered products or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable arrangement fees are generally due within six months or less 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payments terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenue from such arrangements is recognized as payments become due 
collectibility is probable collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial positions and ultimately their ability to pay 
sagent assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customers and their credit worthiness 
sagent obtains and reviews credit reports from the third party credit reporting agencies for new customers with which it is not familiar 
if sagent determines that collection of a fee is not probable  it defers the fee and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we allocate revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to the delivered element using the residual method 
our determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to maintenance  professional services and data services components of our license arrangements 
we sell our data and professional services separately  and have established vsoe on this basis 
we have also established vsoe for maintenance services for accounts less than million through selling such services separately 
vsoe for maintenance services for accounts greater than million is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from data  maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over their respective terms 
sagent usually licenses its software products on a perpetual basis 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is deferred until the earlier of a such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or b all elements are delivered 
where software license contracts call for payment terms of six months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
sagent s customers generally require consulting and implementation services which include evaluating their business needs  identifying the data sources necessary to meet these needs and installing the software solution in a manner that fulfills their needs 
were consulting services essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the license revenue and the consulting service revenue would be recognized as the services are performed 
our arrangements regarding sales of software licenses generally do not include services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
when licenses are sold together with consulting and implementation services  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that a the above revenue recognition criteria are met  b payment of the license fees is not dependent upon performance of the consulting services  and c the services do not include significant alterations to the features and functionality of the software 
to date  services have not been essential to the functionality of the software products for substantially all software agreements 
revenue for transactions with enterprise application vendors  oems  and distributors is generally recognized when the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all related obligations on our part have been satisfied 
however  if the contract stipulates a non refundable royalty payment to be paid in advance of any resale  revenue is recognized upon execution of the contract 
maintenance contracts generally call for us to provide technical support and software updates and upgrades to customers 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally on a straight line basis when all revenue recognition requirements are met 
other service revenue  primarily training and consulting  is generally recognized at the time the service is performed and when it is determined that the company has fulfilled our obligations resulting from the services contract 
valuation of long lived assets sagent assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors could trigger an impairment review 
changes in economic and industry trends 
changes in the strategies of the company in sales and marketing and research and development 
changes in projected future operating results 
changes in the mode of operations and the exit from facilities 
significant decline in sagent s stock price for a significant period of time 
when sagent determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon any of the above indicators of impairment  sagent measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
cash flows are projected for each of the company s geographic regions  which are the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective in upon adoption of sfas no 
 sagent will cease to amortize any goodwill in in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill in and annual reviews thereafter 
sagent does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review  however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
sagent expects to complete the initial review during the first half of asset impairment charges of million in consisted of million reserve on shareholders notes  million reduction in the carrying value of goodwill  million impairment of prepayments for data center services  and million of other losses related to the closing of a remote facility 
sagent has a minority investment in a privately held company 
this investment is included in other long term assets on the balance sheet and is carried at cost since sagent owns less than of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over this company 
this investment is inherently high risk as the market for technologies marketed by the company is at a very early stage and may never be significant 
sagent can potentially lose all its investment in this company 
as a result  sagent continuously monitors its investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary 
in performing the impairment assessment  sagent considers the company s recent equity transactions  current solvency and access to capital 
at december   sagent recognized a loss in this investment 
consolidation of sagent s international operations sagent has several international subsidiaries that accounted for of our net revenue  of our total assets and of our total liabilities as of december  the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
sagent translates the assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries into us dollars at the current rates of exchange in effect during each period 
revenue and expenses are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period 
gains and losses from translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet caption accumulated other comprehensive loss 
accordingly  we had a cumulative translation loss of million and a cumulative translation gain of million at december  and  respectively 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the us dollar  these loss and gains would have increased or decreased our loss for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains and losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the following 
uk british pound 
japan japanese yen 
germany euro 
france french franc 
australia australian dollar 
brazil brazilian real 
benelux euro 
mexico mexican peso 
asia pacific singapore dollar any future translation gains and losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years if the international business continues to grow 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
valuation allowances the preparation of financial statements requires sagent s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
sagent s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which we can reasonably estimate the amount and range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  sagent is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
sagent also analyzes current accounts receivable for a reserve for doubtful accounts based on historical bad debt  customer credit worthiness  the current business environment and historical experience with the customer 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance includes specific reserves for accounts where collection is no longer considered probable 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for invoices without specific reserves by applying a percentage based on the age category 
in  sagent recognized million of bad debt expense and wrote off million in accounts receivable against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
sagent has a days warranty for any defects in the products that it sells to customers 
sagent has not provided any allowances for returns since historically we have not had any material returns due to defects

we expect maintenance revenue to continue to rise during as a result of our effort to continue to increase our installed base of customers and maintain consistent maintenance renewal rates 
professional services revenue was  and million in  and respectively  representing a decrease of or million from to and an increase or million from to the decrease in professional services revenue in from was due to the slow down of the economy and a decline in new license revenue in the increase from to was primarily the result of our concerted efforts to involve the consulting organization in license transactions for related installation and implementation projects  which led to higher customer satisfaction and follow on sales opportunities in the subsequent periods 
sagent continued to grow internationally as such our international revenue was or million  or million and or million of our total net revenue in  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from to and million or from to this increase is attributed mainly to expansion of our international operations during and as well as stronger overseas market demand for our products 
a significant portion of our total revenue is currently derived from international sales and therefore subject to its related risks  including general economic conditions in each country  the strength of international competitors  different tax structures  difficulty of managing an organization spread over various countries  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  longer payment cycles  and the volatility of exchange rates in certain countries 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and their affect on our total revenues were immaterial during and foreign exchange rates will continue to affect our total revenue and results of operations depending on the us dollar strengthening or weakening relative to foreign currencies 
unfavorable changes in each country s general economic and political environment or foreign exchange rates may a material adverse impact on our total revenue and results of operations 
cost of revenue cost of revenue from license sales consists primarily of license fees paid to third parties for integrated technology  royalties  fees paid to third party providers of data and data updates  product packaging  shipping media and documentation 
cost of revenue from license sales was  and million in   and  respectively  representing  and of license revenue in the respective periods 
the increase in absolute dollar amount from to was primarily due to an increase in fees paid to third parties for integrated technology license fees and royalties impairment 
the decrease in absolute dollar amount from to were primarily due to reduced integrated technology license fees  royalties  reductions in headcount  and increased efficiencies in packaging  shipping  media and documentation expense 
cost of service consists primarily of personnel costs associated with providing software maintenance  technical support  training and consulting services 
cost of service was  and million  in  and  respectively  representing  and of services revenue in the respective periods 
the percentage increase from to was primarily due to lower utilization of professional services consultants 
the increase in absolute dollar amounts from to was primarily due to increases in technical support staff and consultants 
the percentage decreases were due to improved utilization of consulting personnel  increased productivity of our customer service and a reduction in the use of outside consultants 
included in cost of revenue  sagent also incurred licensed technology impairments of and million in and  respectively  as such licensed technology were no longer expected to be utilized in our future product sales 
gross profit gross profit was  and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the decline from to was primarily attributed to the million charge for the impairment of licensed technology and an increase million in the cost of revenue for license and service

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel  commissions  travel  sales and marketing programs  branch sales facilities and distributor s commission 
sales and marketing expenses were  and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the sales and marketing expenses remained constant in and in  sagent incurred million expenses in connection with its international expansion and million in distributor s commissions 
these overall increases were offset in part by the decreases of million for closing branch sales offices  million in commissions  million in travel and entertainment expenses and million in sales and marketing expenses as a result of decline in new license fees and implementation of cost cutting measures to control discretionary spending 
the increase from to reflects the additional expenses that sagent incurred in building the direct and indirect sales organizations  the cost associated with restructuring of our sales force in and expansion of sagent s operation internationally

the increase from to was primarily due to significant investment in the form of additional personnel cost and capital equipment was incurred to develop new versions of our software products  new product offerings and localization enhancements of existing products for foreign countries

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  information systems and general management as well as legal  and accounting  bad debt expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  and million for  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the decline from to in absolute dollar amounts was attributable to cost cutting measures  including million savings resulting from the closing of offices  million decrease in bad debt expense and million decrease in legal fees related to litigation 
these decreases were offset in part by the increases of million in compensation resulting from officers loan forgiveness  million in reserve for notes receivable  million in capital lease amortization  million in audit and related services and million in administrative expenses for the new subsidiaries 
the absolute dollar amount increase from to was primarily due to the settlement of litigation  large non recurring third party professional fees  recruitment and relocation of our senior management team  certain executive compensation charges and increase in bad debt expense 
we believe that general and administrative expenses in will decline in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue due to cost cutting measures enacted in the later part of stock based compensation in  sagent granted restricted stock to an officer and recorded deferred stock based compensation of million  this amount represents the difference between the fair value of our stock and the purchase price at the date of grant

sagent is also under obligation to pay certain maintenance fees to third party vendors 
our ability to grow sales and manage our expenses will have a direct impact on our liquidity and capital resources 
factors which are reasonably likely to impact our ability to maintain or grow revenues are as follows 
general economic conditions and the information technology spending environment  
the growth or contraction of the enterprise intelligence software market  
competition from other participants in the enterprise intelligence software market  
our ability to expand our direct and indirect sales channels  
our ability to maintain and expand our marketing  technology and distribution relationships  
our access to licensed technologies integrated in our products and services 
market acceptance of internet solutions  
our ability to manage our international expansion  
our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  and 
our ability to anticipate and respond to technological change 
we believe that our existing cash balances and any cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our operating requirements and may seek  even before such time  to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or any other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or that if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us and would not result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will take actions to conserve our cash balances  including significantly reducing our operating expenses  downsizing our staff and closing existing branch offices  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our ability to reduce losses or generate profits 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a significant impact on our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal year beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill  sagent had recorded million of goodwill amortization in the year ended december  and was anticipating approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company will be required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows 
step the company will compare the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  the company will move to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 

step the company will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
the company will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
the company expects to complete the initial review during the first half of the company does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review  however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
since the requirement is to recognize the obligation when incurred  approaches that have been used in the past to accrue the asset retirement obligation over the life of the asset are no longer acceptable 
statement no 
also requires the enterprise to record the contra to the initial obligation as an increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset ie  the associated asset retirement costs and to depreciate that cost over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time ie  accretion expense and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
the provision of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no  reporting the results of operations reporting the disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of business 
the provision will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods 
the company plans to adopt the provision on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk factors that may affect future results any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the following information about risks  together with the other information contained in this report  before you decide whether to buy our common stock or maintain your investment 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be unimportant could also impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all of your investment 
we have recently restated our financial results for portions of on november   we announced that we were revising our reported revenues for the first nine months of as a result of an internal investigation into the validity of sales orders to various government agencies 
our investigation confirmed that sales orders totaling approximately million booked by one of our employees were forged 
as a result  we filed form q a s for the periods ended march  and june  with financial statements restated to remove the effect of the invalid sales orders 
as a result of the restatement  sagent has been named in shareholder lawsuits 
these lawsuits could seriously harm our business and financial condition 
in particular  the lawsuits could harm our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
the continued defense of the lawsuits also could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payment could seriously harm our financial condition 
the complaints generally allege that we and the other named defendants made false or misleading statements of material facts about our financial results during the complaints  in general  do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
we have not set aside any financial reserves relating to potential damages associated with any of these lawsuits 
our workforce reduction and financial performance may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new employees 
in connection with our effort to streamline operations  increase revenues  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with our current and anticipated requirements  we recently realigned our business organization  which included reduction in workforce 
there may be costs associated with the workforce reduction  and our realignment plan may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in staff 
in addition  our common stock has recently declined in value below the exercise price of many options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
thus  the intended benefits of the stock option granted to our employees  the creation of performance and retention incentives  may not be realized 
in addition  workforce reductions and management changes create anxiety and uncertainty and may adversely affect employee morale 
as a result  we may lose employees whom we would prefer to retain 
due to above factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies they perceive as having less volatile stock prices 
if our stock price declines further  there is a risk that we may be delisted by nasdaq 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq national market  which has certain compliance requirements for continued listing of common stock 
if the minimum closing bid price per share is less than for a period of consecutive business days  our shares may be delisted following a calendar days notice period during which the minimum closing bid price must be or above per share for a period of consecutive trading days  if we do not file an appeal 
on march   the closing price for our common stock was 
the result of delisting from the nasdaq national market would be a reduction in the liquidity of any investment in our common stock 
delisting would reduce the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically 
this lack of liquidity would make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  and not from cash generated by our business 
during the last nine months  we have completed two separate private offerings of our common stock 
in february  we sold million shares of our common stock to a group of private investors  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
in august  we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock to a group of private investors  netting approximately million in proceeds 
although we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and any net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months  a revenue shortfall could require us to reduce operations or raise additional funds through equity or debt financings 
we cannot assure you any equity or debt financing will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that if available  such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will take actions to conserve our cash balances  including significantly reducing our operating expenses  downsizing our staff and closing existing branch offices  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and our ability to reduce losses or generate profits 
variations in our quarterly operating results due to such factors as changes in demand for our products and changes in our mix of revenues may cause our stock price to decline 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
we therefore believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance  and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance or the future performance of our stock price 
our short term expense levels are relatively fixed and are based on our expectations of future revenues 
as a result  a reduction in revenue in a quarter may harm our operating results for that quarter 
in the past  our operating results have fallen below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
if we fall short of market expectations in future quarters  the price of our common stock may fall 
factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly basis include 
varying size  timing and contractual terms of orders for our products  
lengthy sales cycles associated with our products  
changes in the mix of revenue attributable to higher margin product license revenue as opposed to lower margin service revenue  
customers decisions to defer orders or implementations  particularly large orders or implementations  from one quarter to the next  
announcements or introductions of new products by our competitors  
our ability to hire  train and retain sufficient engineering  consulting  training and sales staff  and 
subcontracting to more expensive consulting organizations to help provide implementation  support and training services when our own capacity is constrained 
a slowing economy and reductions in information technology spending may negatively affect our revenues 
our revenues may be negatively affected by the increasingly uncertain economic conditions both in the market generally and in our industry 
if the economy continues to slow  some companies may reduce their budgets for spending on information technology and business software 
as a consequence  our sales cycle may become longer with some customers  and other prospective customers may postpone  reduce  or even forego the purchase of our products and services  which could negatively affect our revenues 
enterprise intelligence software markets may not grow 
since all of our revenues are attributable to the sale of enterprise intelligence software and related maintenance  consulting and training services  if the market for enterprise intelligence software does not grow  our business will not grow 
we expect enterprise intelligence software and services to account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
although demand for enterprise intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market may not continue to grow or  even if the market does grow  businesses may not adopt our products 
if we fail to expand our direct and indirect sales channels  we will not be able to increase revenues 
competition for highly qualified sales personnel is intense  and we may not be able to recruit and maintain the kind and the number of sales personnel we need 
hiring highly qualified customer service and account management personnel is very competitive in the software industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the space 
in order to grow our business  we need to increase market awareness and sales of our products and services 
to achieve this goal  we need to increase both our direct and indirect sales channels 
if we fail to do so  this failure could harm our ability to increase revenues 
we currently receive a significant portion of our revenues from direct sales  but we intend to increase sales through indirect sales channels in the future 
we intend to derive revenues from indirect sales channels by selling our software through value added resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems 
these vars and oems offer our software products to their customers together with consulting and implementation services or integrate our software solutions with other software 
our ability to increase our revenues is dependent on entering into relationships with these vars and oems 
we expect as part of our strategy to increase international sales principally through both direct and indirect sales 
our ability to develop and maintain direct and indirect channels will significantly affect our ability to penetrate international markets 
pending litigation could harm our business 
during the last two years  sagent has been the subject of several shareholder lawsuits  which are still pending 
in addition  the members of our board of directors have been the subjects of derivate lawsuits alleging breaches of their fiduciary duties to sagent 
more recently  as the result of the restatement by sagent of its financial results for portions of  sagent has been named in additional shareholder lawsuits 
these lawsuits could seriously harm our business and financial condition 
in particular  the lawsuits could harm our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
the continued defense of the lawsuits could also result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
the lawsuits could also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirers from bidding for us or reducing the consideration they would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payment could seriously harm our financial condition 
we have a relatively new management team and there is no guarantee that they will be successful in growing our business 
the following table lists each of our officers and the month and year that each of them joined our company name position joined sagent ben c 
barnes president and chief executive officer august steven r 
springsteel executive vice president of finance and november administration and chief financial officer richard ghiossi chief marketing officer october jack peters senior vice president of sales americas september arthur parker president general manager europe  middle east january africa larry scroggins senior vice president of business development january john maxwell senior vice president of sales asia pacific may all of these employees serve at will and may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time 
if our management team is unable to work effectively together to accomplish our business objectives  our ability to grow our business could be severely impaired 
if we do not keep pace with technological change  our products may be rendered obsolete and our business may fail 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and enhancements and emerging industry standards 
in order to achieve broad customer acceptance  our products must be compatible with major software and e commerce applications and operating systems 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in these applications and systems 
if our products were to be incompatible with popular new systems or applications  our business would be significantly harmed 
in addition  the development of entirely new technologies replacing existing software could lead to new competitive products that have better performance or lower prices than our products and could render our products obsolete 
delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forego purchases of our products to purchase those of our competitors 
our markets are highly competitive and competition could harm our ability to sell products and services and reduce our market share 
competition could seriously harm our ability to sell additional software and maintenance and support renewals on prices and terms favorable to us 
additionally  if we cannot compete effectively  we may lose market share 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
we compete against providers of decision support software  data warehousing software and enterprise application software 
we also compete with providers of e business software  which allows for the electronic delivery of products and services that enable commerce among businesses and end users 
companies in each of these areas may expand their technologies or acquire companies to support greater enterprise intelligence functionality and capability  particularly in the areas of query response time and the ability to support large numbers of users 
we may also face competition from vendors of products and turnkey solutions for e business applications that include internet based information functionality 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
we rely  in part  on equity incentives to attract and retain employees  and the performance of our stock price may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in april  and has experienced a significant decline since the first quarter of we have relied historically on our ability to attract and retain employees using equity incentives  and any perception by potential or existing employees that our equity incentives are less attractive could harm our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we rely on marketing  technology and distribution relationships that may generally be terminated at any time  and if our current and future relationships are not successful  our growth may be limited 
we rely on marketing and technology relationships with a variety of companies that  in part  generate leads for the sale of our products 
these marketing and technology relationships include relationships with 
system integrators and consulting firms  
vendors of e commerce and internet software  
vendors of software designed for customer relationship management or for management of organizations operational information  
vendors of key technology and platforms  
demographic data providers  and 
an application service provider 
if we cannot maintain successful marketing and technology relationships or cannot enter into additional marketing and technology relationships  we may have difficulty expanding the sales of our products and our growth may be limited 
if we lose key licenses we may be required to develop or license alternatives  which may cause delays or reductions in sales 
we rely on third party technologies  and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
sagent relies on mainwin from mainsoft to deliver the solaris versions of the data load  data access  and weblink servers 
mainwin is the windows api ported to sun solaris 
in addition  visual basic for applications has been embedded in design studio and information studio to allow customization 
we rely on interfaces from microsoft and crystal decisions to integrate microsoft excel and crystal reports as display options in design studio  information studio  and weblink 
the opalis robot from opalis provides the basis for the sagent automation tool 
automation is a dependency scheduling tool with extensive integration with operating system level tasks 
opalis may not provide a stable solaris version in the timeframe expected by our customers 
the basis for the sagent portal is citrix xps portal product 
citrix may discontinue this product or not make it available on the needed operating systems in a commercially viable time schedule 
the directlink for r product we offer to connect to sap is based on metadata browsing technology and pool table connectivity from server enterprises 
directlink for mainframes  which provides connectivity to mainframe data sources  is enabled by technology from striva and cross access 
failure of commercial users to accept internet solutions could limit our future growth 
a key element of our strategy is to offer users the ability to access  analyze and report information from a data server through a web browser 
our growth may be limited if businesses do not accept internet solutions or perceive them to be cost effective 
continued viability of the internet depends on several factors  including 
third parties abilities to develop new enabling technologies in a timely manner  
the internet s ability to handle increased activity  
the internet s ability to operate as a fast  reliable and secure network  and 
potential changes in government regulation 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including data corruption  cost  ease of use  accessibility and quality of service  remain unresolved and may negatively affect commerce and communication on the internet 
these issues will need to be addressed in order for the market for our products and services to grow 
we have expanded our international operations but may encounter a number of problems in managing overseas operations  which could limit our future growth 
we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products and services internationally 
our failure to manage our international operations effectively could limit the future growth of our business 
international sales represented approximately  and of our total revenue for the year ended december   and  respectively 
we conduct our international sales through local subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  france  japan  brazil  asia pacific  benelux  and australia and through distributor relationships in south africa and spain 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require management attention and significant financial resources 
because of the significant growth in international business  we benefit overall from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may unfavorably affect our consolidated sales and net income 
we have been  and may be subject to future  intellectual property infringement claims 
we may be subject  from time to time  to claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be costly to defend or settle  and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
in december  we settled an infringement claim brought by timeline  inc under the terms of the settlement  we paid timeline  and issued  shares of our common stock to timeline 
we may be subject to similar or more costly claims in the future or may become subject to an injunction against use of our products 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  this inability could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be harmed 
other software providers could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization 
they also could develop similar technology independently which may infringe our proprietary rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose a competitive position in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we discover software defects we may have product related liabilities which may lead to loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance for our products 
our software products are internally complex and may contain errors  defects or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we test our products extensively prior to releasing them  however  in the past we have discovered software errors in some of our products after their introduction 
despite extensive testing  we may not be able to detect and correct errors in products or releases before commencing commercial shipments  which may result in loss of revenue or delays in market acceptance 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
all domestic and international jurisdictions may not enforce these limitations 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we may encounter such claims in the future 
product liability claims  whether or not successful  brought against us could divert the attention of management and key personnel and could be expensive to defend 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  other agreements and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer that it did not feel was in the strategic interests of our company 
if the acquirer was discouraged from offering to acquire us  or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by the anti takeover measures  you could lose the opportunity to sell your shares at a favorable price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors that may affect results beginning on page interest rate risk our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates is primarily due to our highly liquid investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
the primarily objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments and certificate of deposits 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
all investments are carried at cost  which is approximates market value 
at december  and  we had and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
in  sagent has a million line of credit agreement with a bank collateralized by the assets of the company 
the line consists of advances against eligible accounts receivable in an aggregate amount not to exceed the lesser of  the committed revolving line or the borrowing base  less any outstanding letters of credit 
advances against the revolving line bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus  the prime rate was at at december  although we have no outstanding balance under the line of credit  we may borrow under the line in the future 
if we do so and market interest rates rise  then our interest payments would increase accordingly 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states  and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations throughout asia  asia pacific  europe  middle east  south africa and latin america and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
to date  the impact of any fluctuation in the relative value of other currencies has not been material 
however  we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future
