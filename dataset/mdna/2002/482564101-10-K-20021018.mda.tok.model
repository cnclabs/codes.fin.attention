item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations the following table sets forth the company s net sales and certain other financial data for the three fiscal years ended july  years ended july  net sales    gross profit    gross profit as percent of net sales selling  general and administrative expense   operating income    other income expense  net    income before taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    sales revenue and gross profit vs 
net sales revenue was down in fiscal as compared with fiscal wood treating chemical sales were significantly less due to reduced penta sales 
penta is used primarily to treat utility poles 
although penta sales experienced some improvement in the second half of fiscal  penta sales for fiscal were down as compared to fiscal because of soft demand in the utility pole market beginning late in calendar year creosote net sales were generally flat over the two year period 
a combination of factors appears to have caused net sales of msma products in the us to be down in fiscal over dry weather conditions in the southern us cotton growing states limited weed growth and the need for multiple applications of herbicides and distribution chain inventories from the prior year were greater than usual 
farmers in the us also continued to expand their use of the glyphosate herbicides that compete with msma 
gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal improved to from due in part to lower raw material costs 
in addition  fiscal cost of goods sold was reduced thousand as a result of reducing certain estimated accrued liabilities that had been established in prior years  primarily in fiscal management expects that utility pole demand will not improve significantly and that penta profits will be under more pressure in fiscal because of expected increases in raw material costs  particularly in chlorine and phenol 
consequently  the company entered supply contracts for certain raw materials for fiscal to confirm the availability of supply and provide some price protection 
vs 
net sales revenue in fiscal was greater than in fiscal although sales revenue from the company s wood treating chemicals was down significantly in fiscal  that decline was offset by the company s sales of msma products  which began during the second quarter of fiscal management believes that wood treating chemical sales declined in fiscal because commercial demand for railroad crossties and utility poles was below historical levels during the year 
crosstie replacement projects appear to have been deferred by major railroads 
deregulation and mergers in the utility industry led to inventory consolidations that reduced overall demand for replacement utility poles 
additionally  some utilities shifted to purchases of poles treated with a competing product  cca 
because the company s penta product is dissolved in oil to create a treating solution  higher diesel oil prices since fiscal have meant that treating solutions made using cca enjoyed a widened price differential over the company s product compared to historical levels 
gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal moved to from because of the decline in higher margin penta sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were thousand higher than fiscal and fiscal was higher than fiscal in fiscal the company incurred its first full year of environmental regulatory expenses attributable to the msma business it purchased in october and it added a chief financial officer 
most of the increase in fiscal was for expenses related to the company s msma purchase 
the company also incurred severance costs in fiscal for a force reduction at the company s manufacturing facility in mexico 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased in fiscal to million as compared with approximately million and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal trade receivables related to msma expanded as the company responded to the competitive environment by offering the extended payment terms characteristic of that business 
the cash decrease in fiscal was caused by reduced net income as compared with fiscal and the new msma business 
the company increased msma inventories in fiscal and both accounts payable and trade receivables increased in that fiscal year as the company began its new msma business 
the company provided for the operating cash requirements of its msma business by borrowing million in fiscal under its working capital line of credit under a revolving loan agreement as amended from time to time  the revolving credit facility with southtrust bank of alabama  national association southtrust 
the company incurred substantial capital expenditures in fiscal and  primarily in connection with its purchase of the msma business 
in fiscal the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  most of which were for the new msma plant 
in fiscal the company s capital expenditures included million to purchase the msma assets 
the company spent an additional million in fiscal for capital expenditures  primarily for the relocation of the msma facility 
in fiscal the company purchased certain creosote registrations and other intangibles that were financed in part by a million term loan to the company s wholly owned subsidiary  kmg bernuth  inc kmg by southtrust 
the term loan bears interest at a variable rate that was as of july  it is being amortized over seven years in equal monthly installments that total approximately million per year 
in fiscal the company prepaid an additional million of principal on the term loan 
as of september   the principal balance outstanding under the term loan was million 
under the company s revolving credit facility  the company may borrow up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base as defined therein 
the revolving credit facility contains various representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants applicable to kmg  including a limitation that equity investments or loans by kmg not exceed thousand and a requirement to obtain the lender s consent prior to replacing the president and chairman of the board of directors of kmg  david l 
hatcher  or any merger  reorganization or recapitalization of kmg 
in addition  the revolving credit facility requires kmg to maintain i a tangible net worth as defined therein of not less than million  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to  and iii a ratio of liabilities to tangible net worth of not more than to as of september  the company s adjusted borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was million and no amount had been borrowed 
management believes that the term loan and the revolving credit facility adequately provide for the company s anticipated need for liquidity and capital resources in fiscal for the company s current operations 
the company s capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters  excluding fifra testing and data submission costs  were approximately thousand in fiscal and thousand and thousand in fiscal and the increase in fiscal was attributable to the msma business 
the company estimates that its capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters other than fifra will be approximately thousand in fiscal the company expensed approximately thousand for testing costs under fifra in fiscal and approximately thousand and thousand testing in fiscal and management believes that total fifra testing costs will be approximately thousand in fiscal since environmental laws have traditionally become increasingly stringent  costs and expenses relating to environmental control and compliance may increase in the future 
while the company does not believe that the cost of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that costs of compliance will not exceed current estimates 
the company conducts periodic ground water sampling at its facility in tuscaloosa  alabama as required by the alabama department of the environmental management adem 
a sampling revealed the presence of penta contamination and more recent sampling continues to show some contamination  although in lesser amounts 
adem has not required any additional response at this time beyond the continuation of periodic monitoring 
the company does not believe that costs for environmental investigation and remediation will materially impact liquidity or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  although there can be no assurances to this effect

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and requires that the balance sheet valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets be evaluated for impairment at least annually and requires that the regular charge  or amortization  of goodwill assets against income be discontinued 
the company currently does not have goodwill assets on its balance sheet and will perform an impairment analysis on its other intangible assets in fiscal using sfas  but based on a preliminary review management does not believe that an impairment charge will be required 
however  the company has separately identified certain intangible assets that will not be amortizable under sfas therefore  management expects the adoption of sfas could result in a reduced amortization expense for the company 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following revenue recognition the company essentially has only one revenue recognition transaction in which the company s chemical products sold in the open market are recognized as revenue as risk of loss and title to the products transfer to customers  which usually occurs at the time a shipment is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides an allowance for accounts receivable it believes it may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance 
accounts receivable that are written off the company s books decrease the allowance 
the amount of bad debt expense recorded each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period are determined using a combination of the company s historical loss experience  customer by customer analyses of the company s accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of the company s future bad debt exposure 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods that the company holds for sale in the ordinary course of business 
it uses the first in  first out method to value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
management believes the company has not incurred impairments in the carrying value of its inventories 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of  including supply contracts and other intangible assets  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment on an individual asset basis 
item a

the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments or hedging transactions to manage that risk
