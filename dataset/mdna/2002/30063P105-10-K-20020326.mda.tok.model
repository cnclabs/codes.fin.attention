item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained or incorporated by reference herein  this following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond our control 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors including  but not limited to  those factors described in factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we apply proprietary genomics technologies to the early detection of common cancers 
we have selected colorectal cancer screening as the first application of our technology platform 
since our inception on february   our principal activities have included researching and developing our technologies for colorectal cancer screening  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening tests  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others incorporated into our technologies  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  conducting market studies and analyzing potential approaches for commercializing our technologies  hiring research and clinical personnel  hiring management and other support personnel  and raising capital 
initially  we intend to offer colorectal cancer screening services ourselves to establish the market 
we then intend to license our proprietary technologies to leading clinical reference laboratories to enable them to develop tests 
we may also package our technologies and seek approval for diagnostic test kits with which any clinical laboratory could conduct our tests 
we have generated no material operating revenues since our inception  and do not expect any material operating revenues for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in conjunction with our research and development initiatives 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our technologies 
we expect that the cost of our research and development activities will increase substantially as we continue activities relating to the development of our colorectal cancer screening tests and the extension of our technologies to several other forms of common cancers and pre cancerous lesions 
we are currently conducting a clinical trial that will include an estimated  average risk patients from at least academic and community based practices  the costs of which will be borne by us  together with other smaller clinical studies 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses and professional fees 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel and build our infrastructure to support future growth 
stock based compensation expense  a non cash expense  represents the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant 
the stock compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options  which is generally months 
currently  we expect to recognize stock based compensation expense related to employee  consultant and director options of approximately million  million   and  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
significant accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently issued by the securities and exchange commission sec  requires all registrants to discuss critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
further  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and actual results may differ from those estimates 
as we are a development stage company  the areas that require the greatest degree of management judgment is the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  primarily intellectual property  and the realization  if any  of our net deferred tax assets 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the years presented 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue was  for the year ended december  this revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with an agreement signed in july with laboratory corporation of america holdings  inc that is being amortized on a straight line basis over the license period 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable with the initiation of our blinded multi center clinical trial and included increases of million in personnel related expenses   in professional fees and expenses   in laboratory expenses  million in trials and studies expenses and  related to the leasing of additional laboratory space 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to additional personnel hired to build our infrastructure and the initiation of other corporate and marketing programs to support future growth and included increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in professional fees and expenses   in travel related expenses and  related to the leasing of additional office space and related office expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  a non cash expense  increased to million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and million related to general and administrative personnel 
stock based compensation was million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and million related to general and administrative personnel 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents balances resulting from the issuance of common stock in february comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to an increase of  in personnel related expenses  an increase of  in professional fees and expenses  an increase of  in laboratory expenses  an increase of  in trials and studies expenses and an additional  related to the leasing of additional laboratory space 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to an increase of million in personnel related expenses  an increase of million in professional fees and expenses  an increase of  in travel related expenses and an additional  related to the leasing of additional office space 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation increased to million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and million related to general and administrative personnel 
stock based compensation was  for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and  related to general and administrative personnel 
interest income 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents balances resulting from the issuance of preferred stock in april quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for each the eight quarters ended december  in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k  and all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations 
the quarterly data should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of preferred stock  as well as the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock in january as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   million in and million in this increase was primarily due to our increase in operating losses resulting from higher spending in research and development expenses as the company commenced its blinded multi center clinical trial 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as we built our infrastructure and initiated certain corporate and marketing programs to support future growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million in and  in for each of these periods  cash used in investing activities reflected increased investment in our intellectual property portfolio and the expansion of our laboratory and office space 
patent costs  which historically consisted of related legal fees  are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are approved over an estimated useful life of five years 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million in and  in cash provided by financing for the years ended december  resulted from the sale of our common stock from our initial public offering in and the sale of preferred stock in and  respectively 
we expect that cash on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continuing our research and development programs  supporting our clinical study efforts  and launching our marketing efforts 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  and the successful commercialization of colorectal cancer screening tests based on our technologies 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as amended in june  the statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 which is a significant amendment to sfas no 
sfas no 
and its amendments establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively  the derivatives and for hedging activities 
the emerging issues task force eitf has also issued a number of derivative related tentative and final consensuses 
we do not expect the adoption of these statements to have a material impact on our consolidated position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on its financial statements 
sfas is effective january  and requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  the reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  the reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
we do not expect the adoption of these statements to have a material impact on our consolidated position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
we are a development stage company and may never successfully commercialize any of our products or services or earn a profit 
we are a development stage company and have incurred losses since we were formed 
from our date of inception on february  through december   we have accumulated a total deficit of approximately million 
since our colorectal cancer screening tests are still in development  we do not expect to have any material revenue from the sale of our products and services until the second half of even after we begin selling our products and services  we expect that our losses will continue and increase as a result of continuing high research and development expenses  as well as increased sales and marketing expenses 
we cannot assure you that the revenue from any of our products or services will be sufficient to make us profitable 
if our clinical studies do not prove the superiority of our technologies  we may never sell our products and services 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a blinded multi center clinical study that will include approximately  patients with average risk profiles 
in october  we also signed a clinical trial agreement with the mayo clinic in which our genomics based colorectal cancer technology will be the subject of an independent study by mayo clinic for which mayo clinic received a million grant from the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health 
this three year study will involve approximately  patients at average risk for developing colorectal cancer  and compare the results of our non invasive  genomics based screening technology with those of the fecal occult blood test  a common first line colorectal cancer screening option 
the results of these clinical studies may not show that tests using our technologies are superior to existing screening methods 
in that event  we will have to devote significant financial and other resources to further research and development 
in addition  we may experience delays in the commercialization of tests using our technologies or commercialization may never occur 
our earlier clinical studies were small and included samples from high risk patients 
the results from these earlier studies may not be representative of the results we obtain from any future studies  including our planned clinical study  which will include substantially more samples and average risk patients 
we may be unable to recruit a sufficient number of patients for our planned average risk clinical study 
we initiated a blinded multi center clinical study of approximately  average risk patients in the third quarter of if we are unable to enroll the required number of average risk patients  we will be unable to validate the superiority of our technologies  which would make it difficult to sell our products and services 
despite the availability of colorectal cancer screening methods today  most americans who are recommended for colorectal cancer screening do not get screened 
participants in our clinical study will only have an average risk of developing colorectal cancer  yet will have to undergo a colonoscopy 
this procedure requires sedation and causes patient discomfort 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to recruit patients on a timely basis  if at all 
if medicare and other third party payors  including managed care organizations  do not provide adequate reimbursement for our products and services  most clinical reference laboratories will not use our products or license our technologies to perform cancer screening tests 
most clinical reference laboratories will not perform colorectal cancer screening tests using our products and licensing our technologies unless they are adequately reimbursed by third party payors such as medicare and managed care organizations 
there is significant uncertainty concerning third party reimbursement for the use of any test incorporating new technology 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend on a number of factors  including a payor s determination that tests using our products and technologies are sensitive for colorectal cancer  not experimental or investigational  medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient and cost effective 
to date  we have not secured any reimbursement approval for tests using our products and technologies from any third party payor  nor do we expect any such approvals in the near future 
reimbursement by medicare will require approval by the secretary of health and human services  or hhs 
the federal balanced budget act of provides for reimbursement of new technologies such as ours  but only with action of the secretary of hhs 
we cannot guarantee that the secretary of hhs will act to approve tests based on our technologies on a timely basis  or at all 
in addition  the assignment of a current procedural terminology code facilitates medicare reimbursement 
the process to obtain this code is lengthy and we cannot guarantee that we will receive a current procedural terminology code on a timely basis  or at all 
since reimbursement approval is required from each payor individually  seeking such approvals is a time consuming and costly process 
if we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement by medicare and managed care organizations  our ability to generate revenue and earnings from the sale of our products or licenses to our technologies will be limited 
we will not be able to commercialize our technologies if we are not able to lower costs through automating and simplifying key operational processes 
currently  colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies are very expensive because they are labor intensive and use highly complex and expensive reagents 
in order to generate significant profits and make our technologies attractive to potential partners  we will need to reduce substantially the costs of tests using our technologies through significant automation of key operational processes and other cost savings procedures 
if we fail to sufficiently reduce costs  tests using our technologies either may not be commercially viable or may generate little  if any  profitability 
our inability to establish strong business relationships with leading clinical reference laboratories to perform colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies will limit our revenue growth 
a key step in our strategy is to license our proprietary technologies to leading clinical reference laboratories that will perform colorectal cancer screening tests 
while we have executed a strategic alliance agreement with laboratory corporation of america holdings  we have limited experience in establishing these business relationships 
if we are unable to establish additional business relationships with leading clinical reference laboratories  we may have limited ability to generate significant revenue 
our failure to convince medical practitioners to order tests using our technologies will limit our revenue and profitability 
if we fail to convince medical practitioners to order tests using our technologies  we will not be able to sell our products or license our technologies in sufficient volume for us to become profitable 
we will need to make leading gastroenterologists aware of the benefits of tests using our technologies through published papers  presentations at scientific conferences and favorable results from our clinical studies 
our failure to be successful in these efforts would make it difficult for us to convince medical practitioners to order colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies for their patients 
if we lose the support of our key scientific collaborators  it may be difficult to establish tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
we have established relationships with leading scientists  including members of our scientific advisory board  and research institutions  such as the mayo clinic  that we believe are key to establishing tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening 
we have consulting agreements with all but one member of our scientific advisory board  each of which may be terminated by us or the scientific advisory board member with or days notice 
our existing collaboration agreement with the mayo clinic expired on december  if any of our collaborators determine that colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies are not superior to available colorectal cancer screening tests or that alternative technologies would be more effective in the early detection of colorectal cancer  we would encounter difficulty establishing tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which would limit our revenue growth and profitability 
we may experience limits on our revenue and profitability if only an insignificant number of people decide to be screened for colorectal cancer 
even if our technologies are superior to alternative colorectal cancer screening technologies  adequate third party reimbursement is obtained and medical practitioners order tests using our technologies  an insignificant number of people may decide to be screened for colorectal cancer 
despite the availability of current colorectal cancer screening methods as well as the recommendations of the american cancer society and the national cancer institute that all americans age and above be screened for colorectal cancer  most of these individuals decide not to complete a colorectal cancer screening test 
if only an insignificant portion of the population decides to complete colorectal cancer screening tests  we may experience limits on our revenue and profitability 
our inability to apply our proprietary technologies successfully to detect other common cancers may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
while to date  we have focused substantially all of our research and development efforts on colorectal cancer  we have used our technologies to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach and gall bladder 
as a result  we intend to devote significant personnel and financial resources in the future to extending our technology platform to the development of screening tests for these common cancers and pre cancerous lesions 
to do so  we may need to overcome technological challenges to develop reliable screening tests for these cancers 
we may never realize any benefits from these research and development activities 
if we fail to obtain the approval of the us food and drug administration  or fda  or comply with other fda requirements  we may not be able to market our products and services and may be subject to stringent penalties 
the fda does not actively regulate laboratory tests that have been developed and used by the laboratory to conduct in house testing 
the fda does regulate specific reagents  such as ours  that react with a biological substance including those designed to identify a specific dna sequence or protein 
its regulations provide that most such reagents  which the fda refers to as analyte specific reagents  are exempt from the fda s pre market review requirements 
if the fda were to decide to regulate in house developed laboratory tests or decide to require pre market approval or clearance of any analyte specific reagents  the commercialization of our products and services could be delayed  halted or prevented 
if the fda were to view any of our actions as non compliant it could result in regulatory warning  an imposition penalties or other enforcement actions 
similarly  if the fda were to determine that our specimen container requires pre market approval or clearance  the sale of our products and services could be delayed  halted or prevented and the fda could impose penalties on us or seek other enforcement action 
finally  our analyte specific reagents will be subject to a number of fda requirements  including a requirement to comply with the fda s quality system regulation which establishes extensive regulations for quality control and manufacturing procedures 
failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to enforcement action 
adverse fda action in any of these areas could significantly increase our expenses and limit our revenue and profitability 
if we fail to comply with regulations relating to clinical laboratories  we may be prohibited from processing our own tests in house  be required to incur significant expense to correct non compliance  or be subject to other requirements or penalties 
we are subject to us and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories 
for example  the federal clinical laboratory improvement amendments impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories  and establishes standards for quality assurance and quality control  among other things 
clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators  and the possible sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests  requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan  and imposing civil money or criminal penalties 
in may  we received a clinical laboratory certificate of compliance 
however  if we fail to meet the requirements of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments in the future  we could be required to halt providing services and incur significant expense  thereby limiting our revenue and profitability 
other companies may develop and market methods for detecting colorectal cancer  which may make our technologies less competitive  or even obsolete 
the market for colorectal cancer screening is large  approximating million americans age and above  and has attracted competitors  some of which have significantly greater resources than we have 
currently  we face competition from alternative procedures based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy  as well as traditional screening tests such as the fecal occult blood test 
other entities are developing new colorectal screening methods such as virtual colonoscopy  an experimental procedure being developed at research institutions in which a radiologist views the inside of the colon through a scanner 
in addition  competitors  including bayer corporation  diadexus  inc  matritech  inc 
and millennium predictive medicine  inc  are developing serum based tests  or screening tests based on the detection of proteins or nucleic acids produced by colon cancer 
these and other companies may also be working on additional methods of detecting colon cancer that have not yet been announced 
we may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their test is superior or because they may have more expertise  experience  financial resources and business relationships 
the loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of key members of our senior management team  don m 
hardison  our president and chief executive officer  john a 
mccarthy  jr  our executive vice president  chief operating officer  chief financial officer and treasurer  and anthony p 
shuber  our senior vice president and chief technology officer 
anthony p 
shuber  together with stanley n 
lapidus  our chairman  have been critical to the development of our technologies and business 
mr 
hardison  who joined us in may  and mr 
mccarthy  who joined us in october  are key additions to our management team and will be critical to directing and managing our growth and development in the future 
we have no employment agreements with any of messrs 
lapidus  hardison  mccarthy or shuber  however  each has signed a non disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreement and non compete agreement 
we also have a severance agreement with each of messrs 
lapidus  hardison  mccarthy and shuber that provides for twelve months severance under certain circumstances 
the efforts of each of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and our testing process and as we attempt to transition from a development company to a company with commercialized products and services 
if we were to lose one or more of these key employees  we may experience difficulties in competing effectively  developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively  we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies  which would impair our competitive advantage 
we rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies  all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies and they will be able to compete more effectively against us 
as of december   we had issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states 
we also had issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents  and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be issued 
further  we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge any patents issued to us  or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable 
a third party institution has asserted co inventorship rights with respect to one of our issued patents relating to pooling patient samples in connection with our loss of heterozygosity detection method 
we cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending this or other challenges made in connection with our patents and patent applications 
any successful third party challenge to our patents could result in co ownership of such patents with a third party or the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents 
in addition  we and a third party institution have filed a joint patent application that will be co owned by us and that third party institution relating to the use of various dna markers  including one of our detection methods  to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach  small intestine  bile duct  naso pharyngeal  liver and gall bladder in stool under the patent cooperation treaty 
this patent application designates the united states  japan  europe and canada 
co ownership of a patent allows the co owner to exercise all rights of ownership  including the right to use  transfer and license the rights protected by the applicable patent 
in addition to our patents  we rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
we require our employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements and employees to also sign agreements assigning to us all intellectual property arising from their work for us 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights 
we cannot guarantee that the patents issued to us will be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection nor can we assure you that one of our competitors may not develop more effective technologies  designs or methods to test for colorectal cancer or any other common cancer without infringing our intellectual property rights or that one of our competitors might not design around our proprietary technologies 
we may incur substantial costs to protect and enforce our patents 
we have pursued an aggressive patent strategy designed to maximize our patent protection against third parties in the us and in foreign countries 
we have filed patent applications that cover the methods we have designed to detect colorectal cancer and other cancers  as well as patent applications that cover our testing process 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate actions against third parties 
any actions regarding patents could be costly and time consuming  and divert our management and key personnel from our business 
additionally  such actions could result in challenges to the validity or applicability of our patents 
we may be subject to substantial costs and liability or be prevented from selling our screening tests for cancer as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent rights 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our licensors or us 
we pursue an aggressive patent strategy that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the early detection of colorectal cancer and other common cancers 
we currently have issued us patents and pending patent applications in the united states 
because the us patent trademark office maintains patent applications in secrecy until a patent issues  others may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications 
there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with our products or processes 
even if third party claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and may divert the attention of management and key personnel 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies if any  awarded against us would not be substantial 
claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
these claims may also result in injunctions against the further development and use of our technology  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  patents and applications owned by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us  as well as a possible adverse decision as to the priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved 
an adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in the loss or rights under a patent or patent application subject to such a proceeding 
our business would suffer if certain licenses were terminated 
we license certain technologies from roche molecular systems  inc and genzyme corporation that are key to our technologies 
the roche license for the polymerase chain reaction pcr technology  which relates to a gene amplification process used in almost all genetic testing  is a non exclusive license through  the date on which the patent that we utilize expires 
roche may terminate the license upon notice if we fail to pay royalties  submit certain reports or breach any other material term of the license agreement 
the genzyme license is a non exclusive license to use the apc and p genes and methodologies relating to the genes in connection with our products and services through  the date on which the term of the patent that we utilize expires 
genzyme may terminate the license upon notice if we fail to pay milestone payments and royalties  achieve a certain level of sales  or submit certain reports 
in addition  if we fail to use reasonable efforts to make products and services based on these patents available to the public or fail to request fda clearance for a diagnostic test kit as required by the agreement  genzyme may terminate the license 
if either roche or genzyme were to terminate the licenses  we would incur significant delays and expense to change a portion of our testing methods and we cannot guarantee that we would be able to change our testing methods without affecting the sensitivity of our tests 
changes in healthcare policy could subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may delay the commercialization of our tests and increase our costs 
healthcare policy has been a subject of discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments 
we developed a staged commercialization strategy for our colorectal cancer screening tests based on existing healthcare policies 
changes in healthcare policy  if implemented  could substantially delay the use of our tests  increase costs  and divert management s attention 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may limit our growth 
we may need to raise additional funds to execute our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may have to restrict our operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our company and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of march   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates together control approximately of our outstanding common stock  without giving effect to the exercise of outstanding options under our stock plans 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control  could deprive you of the opportunity to receive a premium for your common stock as part of a sale and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our charter  by laws and delaware law may make it difficult for you to change our management and may also make a takeover difficult 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to change our management and may also enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice procedures required for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and cause us to take other corporate actions 
in addition  the existence of these provisions  together with delaware law  might hinder or delay an attempted takeover other than through negotiations with our board of directors 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  clinical trial results relating to our tests or those of our competitors  reimbursement decisions by medicare and other managed care organizations  fda regulation of our products and services  the establishment of partnerships with clinical reference laboratories  health care legislation  intellectual property disputes  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our common stock 
because we are a development stage company with no material revenue expected until the second half of  you may consider one of these factors to be material 
our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above 
in addition  the nasdaq national market and the market for applied genomics companies in particular  has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of those companies 
future sales by our existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock 
if our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
moreover  the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
