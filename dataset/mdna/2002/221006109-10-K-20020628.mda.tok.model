industry overview workers compensation is a federally mandated  state legislated  comprehensive insurance program that requires employers to fund medical expenses  lost wages and other costs resulting from work related injuries and illnesses 
since their introduction in the early s  these programs have been expanded to all fifty states and the district of columbia 
each state is responsible for implementing and 
table of contents regulating its own program 
consequently  workers compensation benefits and arrangements vary on a state by state basis and are often highly complex 
workers compensation plans generally require employers to fund all of an employee s costs of medical treatment and a significant portion of lost wages  legal fees and other associated costs of work related injuries 
typically  work related injuries are broadly defined  and injured or ill employees are entitled to extensive benefits 
employers are required to provide first dollar coverage with no co payment or deductible due from the injured or ill employee for medical treatment and  in many states  there is no lifetime limit on expenses 
however  in exchange for providing this coverage for employees  employers are not subject to litigation by employees for benefits in excess of those provided by the relevant state statute 
in most states  the extensive benefits coverage for both medical costs and lost wages is provided through the purchase of commercial insurance from private insurance companies  participation in state run insurance funds or employer self insurance 
provider reimbursement methods vary on a state by state basis 
a majority of states have adopted fee schedules pursuant to which all health care providers are uniformly reimbursed 
the fee schedules are set by each state and generally prescribe the maximum amounts that may be reimbursed for a designated procedure 
in states without fee schedules  health care providers are reimbursed based on usual and customary or reasonable fees charged in the particular state in which the services are provided 
workers compensation is a statutorily defined employee benefit  which varies on a state by state basis 
workers compensation laws generally require employers to fully pay for employees costs of medical treatment  lost wages  legal fees and other costs associated with work related injuries and disabilities and  in certain jurisdictions  mandatory vocational rehabilitation 
companies provide such coverage to their employees through either the purchase of commercial insurance from private insurance companies  participation in state run funds or through self insurance 
many states do not permit employers to restrict a claimant s choice of provider  making it more difficult for employers to utilize managed care approaches such as hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
however  in many states  employers have the right to direct employees to a specific primary health care provider during the onset of a workers compensation case  subject to the right of the employee to change physicians after a specific period 
in addition  workers compensation programs vary from state to state  making it difficult for payors and multi state employers to adopt uniform policies to administer  manage  and control the costs of benefits 
as a result  managing the cost of workers compensation requires approaches  which are tailored to the specified regulatory environment s in which the employer is operating 
managed care techniques are intended to control the cost of health care services and to measure the performance of providers through intervention and on going review of services proposed and actually provided 
managed care techniques were originally developed to stem the rising costs of group medical care 
historically  employers were slow to apply managed care techniques to workers compensation costs primarily because the aggregate costs are relatively small compared to costs associated with group health benefits and because state by state regulations related to workers compensation are far more complex than those related to group health 
in addition  workers compensation programs vary from state to state  making it difficult for payors and multi state employers to adopt uniform policies to administer  manage and control the costs of benefits 
managing the cost of workers compensation requires approaches that are tailored to the specific state regulatory environment in which the employer operates 
however  in recent years  employers and insurance carriers have been increasing their focus on applying managed care techniques to control their workers compensation costs 
since workers compensation benefits are mandated by law and are subject to extensive regulation  payors and employers do not have the same flexibility to alter benefits as they have with other health benefits programs 
an increasing number of states have adopted legislation encouraging the use of workers compensation managed care organizations mcos in an effort to allow employers to control their workers compensation costs 
mco laws generally provide employers an opportunity to channel injured 
table of contents employees into provider networks 
in certain states  mco laws require licensed mcos to offer certain specified services  such as utilization management  case management  peer review and provider bill review 
most of the mco laws adopted to date establish a framework within which a company such as the company can provide its customers a full range of managed care services for greater cost control 
business strategy the company believes that payors and employers impacted by the escalating medical costs of workers compensation will increasingly require services and programs to manage such costs 
the company s business strategy is to offer a range of services through a national network of branch offices  supported by information management systems  to respond to such need on both a local and national level 
breadth of service a key element of the company s strategy is to capitalize on its background and specialization in workers compensation  established initially in the area of case management  to offer a range of services  including bill review  ppos and independent medical examinations imes  to assist insurance carriers  tpas and self administered employers in managing the cost of workers compensation and monitoring the quality of care provided 
the company plans to continue to expand its range of services to respond to the needs of its customers 
national branch office network an integral part of the company s strategy is to offer services at the local or regional level where workers compensation claims are administered 
each office has access to centralized services and software developed at the company s corporate offices and is capable of responding to the particular regulatory environment in which it operates 
the company adds branch offices by identifying target markets  generally geographically contiguous to an existing market  where it believes it can successfully introduce one or more of its services 
the company may also establish new offices in response to the needs of national customers 
in addition to expanding the number of branch office locations  the company expects to add existing services as well as new services to its branch offices 
informational management capabilities the company s strategy also includes the continued development of software and its computer system network capable of supporting the review and management of medical information on the internet 
claims and patient data can be entered from field locations  processed by the company and made available for consolidated reporting or for automated interfacing to customer computer systems

the provider programs offered by the company include automated medical fee auditing  preferred provider services  and retrospective utilization review 
medcheck corvel s proprietary bill review system many states have adopted fee schedules  which regulate the maximum allowable fees payable under workers compensation for procedures performed by a variety of health treatment providers 
such 
table of contents schedules may also include fees for hospital treatment 
the purpose of a fee schedule is to standardize the billing process by using uniform procedure descriptions and to set maximum reimbursement levels for each covered service 
certain other states permit payors to pay workers compensation medical costs limited to usual and customary charges for the relevant community 
the company provides automated medical fee auditing to assist the company s customers in verifying that the fees charged by workers compensation health care providers comply with state fee schedules  or are consistent with usual and customary charges 
the company offers its fee schedule auditing through a computerized medical bill review service called medcheck  which combines automated data reporting and transmission capabilities

when installed at an insurer  the medcheck suite can accept electronic data interfaces edi from corvel and other sources 
this interface automates the reimbursement of provider reimbursements  allows for the application of all medcheck fees to the individual claim file and eliminates the need for manual redundant data entry of medcheck results by the carriers claims personnel 
in addition  medcheck can send its own files on to the mainframe claims administration systems of major insurers and other payors 
the system is designed for easy access by claims adjusters and includes functionality for such part time users within the claims payment environment 
medcheck includes an artificial intelligence ai module first review which allows insurers to incorporate the latest in software intelligence 
medcheck s first review module can incorporate intelligence unique to specific insurance programs 
in addition to these ai features  medcheck s development reflects corvel s experience as one of the leading managed care companies in the country 
an important element of the company s business strategy is to introduce medcheck to additional existing branch offices and increase its use by current customers 
the company plans to continue to invest in the expansion of its medcheck medical review software to better serve the claims processing needs of customers through automated interfacing with its customers computer systems 
during fiscal  the company announced the release of its medcheck  version  which adjudicates medical reimbursement for workers compensation  automobile  and accident health claims

customers and marketing the company s customers are workers compensation insurers and  to a lesser extent  tpas and self administered employers 
many claims management decisions in workers compensation are the responsibility of the local claims office of national or regional insurers 
the company s national branch office network has been established to enable the company to market and offer its services at both a local and national account level 
the company is placing increasing emphasis on national account marketing 
the marketing activities of the company are conducted by account executives located in key geographic areas  and by national account executives from the corporate office 
most of the major workers compensation insurance carriers conduct business with the company 
none of the company s customers represented more than of revenues in fiscal   or competition and market conditions the healthcare cost containment industry is highly fragmented and competitive 
the intensity of competition can be expected to increase 
the company s primary competitors in the workers compensation market are several large insurance carriers which offer one or more services similar to those offered by the company  hmos and numerous independent companies  typically on a local or regional basis 
the company also competes with national and local firms specializing in utilization review and with major insurance carriers and tpas which have implemented their own internal utilization review services 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to maintain its existing performance  or be successful with any new products or in any new geographical markets it may enter 
moreover  the company s customers may establish the in house capability of performing services offered by the company 

table of contents legislative reforms in some states permit employers to designate health plans such as hmos and ppos to cover workers compensation claimants 
because many health plans have the capacity to manage health care for workers compensation claimants  such legislation may intensify competition in the market served by the company 
within the past few years  several states have experienced a decrease in the number of workers compensation claims and average cost per claim 
this has been reflected in workers compensation insurance premium rate reductions in those states 
the company believes that declines in workers compensation costs in these states are due principally to intensified efforts by payors to manage and control claim costs  to improved risk management by employers and to legislative reforms 
if declines in workers compensation costs occur in many states and persist over the long term  they may have an adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
the company competes on the basis of its specialization in workers compensation  breadth of services  ability to offer local services on a nationwide basis  information management systems and independence from insurance carriers 
government regulation general managed health care programs for workers compensation are subject to various laws and regulations 
both the nature and degree of applicable government regulation vary greatly depending upon the specific activities involved 
generally  parties that actually provide or arrange for the provision of health care services  assume financial risk related to the provision of those services  or undertake direct responsibility for making payment or payment decisions for those services  are subject to a number of complex regulatory schemes that govern many aspects of their conduct and operations 
in contrast  the management and information services provided by the company to its customers typically have not been the subject of regulation by the federal government or the states 
since the managed health care field is a rapidly expanding and changing industry and the cost of providing health care continues to increase  it is possible that the applicable state and federal regulatory frameworks will expand to have a greater impact upon the conduct and operation of the company s business 
under the current workers compensation system  employer insurance or self funded coverage is governed by individual laws in each of the states and by certain federal laws 
the management and information services that make up the company s managed care program serve markets that have developed largely in response to needs of insurers  employers and large tpas  and generally have not been mandated by legislation or other government action 
on the other hand  the vocational rehabilitation case management marketplace within the workers compensation system has been dependent upon the laws and regulations within those states that require the availability of specified rehabilitation services for injured workers 
similarly  the company s fee schedule auditing services address market needs created by certain states enactment of maximum permissible fee schedules for workers compensation services 
changes in individual state regulation of workers compensation may create a greater or lesser demand for some or all of the company s services  or require the company to develop new or modified services in order to meet the needs of the marketplace and compete effectively in that marketplace 
medical cost containment legislation historically  governmental strategies to contain medical costs in the workers compensation field have been generally limited to legislation on a state by state basis 
for example  many states have implemented fee schedules that list maximum reimbursement levels for health care procedures 
in certain states that have not authorized the use of a fee schedule  the company adjusts bills to the usual and customary levels authorized by the payor 
opportunities for the company s services could increase as more states legislate additional cost containment strategies 
conversely  the company could be adversely affected if states elect to reduce the extent of medical cost containment strategies available to insurance 
table of contents carriers and other payors  or adopt other strategies for cost containment that would not support a demand for the company s services 
healthcare reform there has been considerable discussion of healthcare reform at both the federal level and in numerous state legislatures in recent years 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and the timing of their enactment  the company cannot predict which  if any  reforms will be adopted  when they may be adopted  or what impact they may have on the company 
vocational rehabilitation legislation during the early s  the case management marketplace within workers compensation was dominated by the provision of medical management services 
such services were purchased at the option of insurance carriers with little or no support from legislative efforts within any of the states 
by the mid s  it became popular for states to legislate either supportive programs for vocational rehabilitation or  in some cases  mandatory vocational rehabilitation statutes 
shareholder rights plan during fiscal  the company s board of directors approved the adoption of a shareholder rights plan 
the rights plan  which is similar to rights plans adopted by numerous other public companies  provides for a dividend distribution to corvel stockholders of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of corvel s common stock 
in april   the board of directors of corvel corporation approved an amendment to the company s existing stockholder rights agreement to extend the expiration date of the rights to february   increase the initial exercise price of each right from adjusted for the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend in may and the three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid in august to and enable fidelity management research company and its affiliates to purchase up to of the shares of common stock of the company without triggering the stockholder rights 
the limitations under the rights agreement remain in effect for all other stockholders of the company 
the rights are designed to assure that all stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company and to encourage a potential acquirer to negotiate with the board of directors prior to attempting a takeover 
the rights have an exercise price of per right  subject to subsequent adjustment 
the rights trade with the company s common stock  and will not be exercisable until the occurrence of certain takeover related events 
generally  the rights plan provides that if a person or group acquires or more of the company s common stock without the approval of the board  subject to certain exception  the holders of the rights  other than the acquiring person or group  would  under certain circumstances  have the right to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the right 
in addition  if the company is thereafter merged into another entity  or if or more of the company s consolidated assets or earning power are sold  then the right will entitle its holder to buy common shares of the acquiring entity having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the right 
the company s board of directors may exchange or redeem the rights under certain conditions 
employees as of march   corvel had approximately  employees  including nurses  therapists  counselors and other employees 
no employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit 
management considers its relationship with its employees to be good 

table of contents risk factors past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors in the company s common stock should not use historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends 
before deciding to invest in corvel or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the company s other filings with the sec  including its reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may also affect its business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price of the company s common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
potential adverse impact of government regulation 
many states  including a number of those in which the company transacts business  have licensing and other regulatory requirements applicable to the company s business 
approximately half of the states have enacted laws that require licensing of businesses  that provide medical review services  such as the company 
some of these laws apply to medical review of care covered by workers compensation 
these laws typically establish minimum standards for the qualification of personnel  confidentiality  internal quality control and dispute resolution procedures 
these regulatory programs may result in increased costs of operation for the company  which may have an adverse impact upon the company s ability to compete with other available alternatives for health care cost control 
in addition  new laws regulating the operation of managed care provider networks have been adopted by a number of states 
these laws may apply to managed care provider networks having contracts with the company or to provider networks  which the company may organize 
to the extent the company is governed by these regulations  it may be subject to additional licensing requirements  financial and operational oversight and procedural standards for beneficiaries and providers 
regulation in the health care and workers compensation fields is constantly evolving 
the company is unable to predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting its business may be promulgated in the future 
the company s business may be adversely affected by failure to comply with existing laws and regulations  failure to obtain necessary licenses and government approvals or failure to adapt to new or modified regulatory requirements 
proposals for health care legislative reforms are regularly considered at the federal and state levels 
to the extent that such proposals affect workers compensation  such proposals may adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  changes in workers compensation laws or regulations may impact demand for the company s services  require the company to develop new or modified services to meet the demands of the marketplace or modify the fees that the company may charge for its services 
one of the proposals which has been considered is hour health coverage  in which the coverage of traditional employer sponsored health plans is combined with workers compensation coverage to provide a single insurance plan for work related and non work related health problems 
incorporating workers compensation coverage into conventional health plans may adversely affect the market for the company s services 
possible litigation and legal liability 
the company  through its utilization management services  makes recommendations concerning the appropriateness of providers medical treatment plans of patients throughout the country  and as a result  could be exposed to claims for adverse medical consequences 
the company does not grant or deny claims for payment of benefits and the company does not believe that it engages in the practice of medicine or the delivery of medical services 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not be subject to claims or litigation related to the grant or denial of claims for payment of benefits or allegations that the company engages in the practice of medicine or the delivery of medical services 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to other litigation that may adversely affect the company s business or results of operations 
the company maintains professional liability insurance and such other coverages as the company believes are reasonable in light of the company s experience to date 
there can be no assurance  however  that such insurance will be sufficient 
table of contents or available in the future at reasonable cost to protect the company from liability which might adversely affect the company s business or results of operations 
competition 
the company faces competition from hmos  ppos  tpas and other managed health care companies 
the company believes that  as managed care techniques continue to gain acceptance in the workers compensation marketplace  corvel s competitors will increasingly consist of nationally focused workers compensation managed care service companies  insurance companies  hmos and other significant providers of managed care products 
legislative reforms in some states permit employers to designate health plans such as hmos and ppos to cover workers compensation claimants 
because many health plans have the ability to manage medical costs for workers compensation claimants  such legislation may intensify competition in the markets served by the company 
many of the company s current and potential competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than those of the company  and there can be no assurance that the company will continue to maintain its existing clients or its past level of operating performance or be successful with any new products or in any new geographical markets it may enter 
changes in market dynamics 
within the past few years  several states have experienced a decrease in the number of workers compensation claims and average cost per claim 
this has been reflected in workers compensation insurance premium rate reductions in those states 
the company believes that declines in workers compensation costs in these states are due principally to intensified efforts by payors to manage and control claim costs  to improved risk management by employers and to legislative reforms 
if declines in workers compensation costs occur in many states and persist over the long term  they may have an adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel 
the company is dependent to a substantial extent upon the continuing efforts and abilities of certain key management personnel  especially v 
gordon clemons  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president 
our success will also depend in large part upon our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate experienced employees with professional expertise in the workers compensation managed care area 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of  such highly skilled employees 
our inability to attract  and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of our current key employees could adversely affect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to growth strategy 
the company s strategy is to continue its internal growth and  as strategic opportunities arise in the workers compensation managed care industry  to consider acquisitions of  or relationships with  other companies in related lines of business 
as a result  the company is subject to certain growth related risks  including the risk that it will be unable to retain personnel or acquire other resources necessary to service such growth adequately 
expenses arising from the company s efforts to increase its market penetration may have a negative impact on operating results 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any suitable opportunities for strategic acquisitions or relationships will arise or  if they do arise that the transactions contemplated thereby could be completed 
if such a transaction does occur  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate effectively any acquired business into the company 
in addition  any such transaction would be subject to various risks associated with the acquisition of businesses  including the financial impact of expenses associated with the integration of businesses 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisition or other strategic relationship will not have an adverse impact on the company s business or results of operations 
if suitable opportunities arise  the company anticipates that it would finance such transactions  as well as its internal growth  through working capital or  in certain instances  through debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such debt or equity financing would be available to the company on acceptable terms when  and if  suitable strategic opportunities arise 
during the past fiscal year  the company has made efforts to increase its presence and revenue in the group health market with moderate success 
managed care in this market is more mature than managed care in workers compensation and has numerous large competitors  primarily hmos 
the company has 
table of contents limited experience in the group health market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this market 
certain aspects of the company s business are dependent upon its ability to store  retrieve  process and manage data and to maintain and upgrade its data processing capabilities 
interruption of data processing capabilities for any extended length of time  loss of stored data  programming errors or other computer problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the ability of management to expeditiously retrieve and analyze financial information from its nationwide branch network 
the company is currently in the process of installing new company wide management information software and there can be no assurance that the installation of this new system will proceed according to plan 
in addition  the company expects that a considerable amount of its future growth will depend on its ability to process and manage claims data more efficiently and to provide more meaningful healthcare information to customers and payors of healthcare 
there can be no assurance that the company s current data processing capabilities will be adequate for its future growth  that it will be able to efficiently upgrade its systems to meet future demands  or that the company will be able to develop  license or otherwise acquire software to address these market demands as well or as timely as its competitors 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock may be highly volatile 
factors such as variations in the company s revenues  earnings and cash flow  general market trends in the workers compensation managed care market  and announcements of innovations by the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
specifically  the year to year percentage growth in operating results for the company s four most recently completed fiscal years was lower than the growth rates historically experienced by the company 
the company s slower growth rate in those fiscal years was partially attributable to a reduction in the growth rate of health care expenditures nationally  contributing to a reduction in the growth of claims processed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s earnings will grow in the future or grow at or near historical levels 
in addition  the stock market has in the past experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected companies in the health care and managed care markets resulting in changes in the market price of the stock of many companies which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies 
importance of intellectual property rights 
the company has made significant investments in the development and maintenance of its proprietary software systems and data 
the company relies largely on its own security systems  confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure agreements to maintain the confidentiality and security of its proprietary information 
unauthorized access by third parties to the company s information systems  the existence of computer viruses in the company s data or software or misappropriation of the company s proprietary information may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
control by insiders 
as of may   two of the company s directors beneficially owned approximately of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
as a result of their stock ownership  these parties will be able to significantly influence the election of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  such as mergers and acquisitions  regardless of how the company s other stockholders may vote 
this concentration of voting control may have a significant effect in delaying  deferring or preventing a change in the management or change in control of the company and may adversely affect the voting or other rights of other holders of common stock 
anti takeover provisions 
certain provisions of the company s stockholder rights plan could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the company  even though an acquisition might be beneficial to the company s stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
in  the 
table of contents company adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of preferred stock purchase rights to its stockholders 
in the event a third party acquires more than of the outstanding voting control of the company or of its outstanding common stock  the holders of these rights will be able to purchase the junior participating preferred stock at a substantial discount off of the then current market price 
the exercise of these rights and purchase of a significant amount of stock at below market prices could cause substantial dilution to a particular acquirer and discourage the acquirer from pursuing the company 
the mere existence of a stockholder rights plan often delays or makes a merger  tender offer or proxy contest more difficult 
no cash dividends 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
