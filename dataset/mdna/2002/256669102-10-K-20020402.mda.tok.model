there were weeks in the fiscal year ended february  there were weeks in the fiscal years ended february  and january  there will be weeks in the fiscal year ended january  this discussion and analysis should be read with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
please note that  by means of its annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended february  filed on january   the company has restated its financial statements for fiscal years and  as well as certain unaudited financial information for fiscal year that had been previously released by the company 
the following discussion reflects the results of that restatement 
overview of during  dollar general increased its net sales by  primarily as a result of its continued rapid pace of new store openings 
from through  the company had a compound annual net sales growth rate of 
same store sales increased in  as compared with increases of and in and  respectively 
as discussed further below  management believes that the company s relatively strong operating performance in was due in part to improved in stock conditions and various merchandising initiatives which helped generate additional sales at acceptable gross profit rates 
the year marked the fourteenth consecutive year that the company increased its total number of store units 
the company opened new stores in  compared with in and in  and remodeled or relocated stores  compared with in and in during the last three years  the company has opened  remodeled or relocated  stores  accounting for approximately of the total stores as of february  the company ended fiscal with  stores 
in  new stores  remodels and relocations  net of closed stores  added an aggregate of approximately million selling square feet to the company s total sales space 
as a result  the company had an aggregate of approximately million selling square feet at the end of the year 
the average new store opened in had approximately  selling square feet compared to approximately  selling square feet for new stores opened in virtually all of the new stores opened in are subject to traditional operating lease arrangements 
the company opened its seventh dc in zanesville  ohio in april of the company currently expects to open approximately new stores and close to stores in  and to remodel or relocate approximately stores 
the company will continue to focus on opening new stores in towns with populations of  or fewer and within miles of its dcs 
the company expects its new stores to be subject to operating lease arrangements 
capital expenditures related to new store openings will be financed through a combination of operating cash flow and credit facilities 
store investment and infrastructure upgrades continued to be priorities in at february   the systems to support perpetual inventories were installed in approximately  stores 
management expects to have the systems to support perpetual inventories in all stores by the end of  and to begin implementation in a perpetual inventory allows the company to track store level inventory at the sku level  which should result in better inventory management 
additionally  management expects to enhance store communications and improve customer service through the installation of satellite communications technology 
at february  such technology was installed in approximately  stores 
the company expects to complete the rollout of its satellite technology in all stores in the company acquired a new merchandise planning and allocation system in that improves its ability to prepare sales  inventory and margin plans 
the company also established a business to business website in for use in communicating with transportation carriers to move loaded trailers to the dcs 
critical accounting policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate cost figures 
factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover  and applying rim to transactions over a period of time that includes different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory from occurring  the company s rim utilizes departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped 
in addition  failure to take markdowns currently can result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
during fiscal  the company recorded markdowns that had not been taken and which served to reduce inventories to lower of cost or market by approximately million 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company is collecting sku level inventory information at each of its stores during in an effort to establish an item based perpetual inventory system 
in conjunction with this undertaking  the company will be expanding the number of departments it utilizes for its gross margin calculations 
as noted above see overview of  management expects to implement its new inventory system in these changes may impact the rim calculation results in fiscal and in subsequent years 
results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein 
net sales 
net sales totaled billion for  billion for and billion for  representing annual increases of in  in and in the increases resulted primarily from net new stores and a same store sales increase of in  net new stores and a same store sales increase of in  and net new stores and a same store sales increase of in the company tracks its sales internally by four divisions highly consumable  hardware and seasonal  basic clothing and home products

total sales in the hardware and seasonal department increased by   and in  and  respectively 
total sales in the basic clothing department increased by  and in  and  respectively 
total sales in the home products department experienced annual changes of  and  respectively 
the company attributes the same store sales increase that it achieved in to a number of factors  including but not limited to an improved in stock position  an increase in the number of stores offering perishable products from in to approximately by the end of  strong sales of seasonal merchandise resulting in part from additional floor space dedicated to such items as part of the store reset program  described below  that was undertaken in  and expanded offerings in certain highly consumable categories including home cleaning  paper products and pet supplies 
the company believes that the lower same store sales increase in was due primarily to the disruptive effect of a comprehensive store reset program designed to improve the product mix and appearance of its stores  which affected the vast majority of the store base 
other factors that may have had an impact on the lower same store sales increase in include a change in store ordering procedures from a manual process to a new automated system relying on the scanning of shelf tags  which may have been an additional cause of the sporadic out of stock conditions experienced by the company during this period  and a general softening of economic conditions 
the relatively strong same store sales increase in was due primarily to the company s ongoing shift in emphasis to the consumable basics segment of its business 
gross profit 
gross profit for was billion  or of sales  compared with billion  or of sales in and billion  or of sales in the improvement in the gross profit rate in as compared to is due primarily to the million effect of a markdown recorded in as described in note to the consolidated financial statements see item  the markdown in resulted from the identification by the company of certain excess inventories that it believes will require a markdown to assist with their disposition by the conclusion of there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell all of this inventory by the end of without marking down the inventory at issue in amounts exceeding the markdown recorded to date 
the company also improved its initial margin on inventory purchases by basis points in as compared against the company was able to make particular improvements in its inventory margin in the housewares  seasonal and mens and boys clothing product lines 
the decline in the gross profit rate in as compared to was due primarily to the million effect of the markdown described above 
inventory shrinkage calculated at the retail value of the inventory  as a percentage of sales  was in  in  and in the company s goal is to maintain a shrink rate in the range of to 
in the company appointed approximately financial control specialists to assist its stores with various shrinkage reduction efforts 
these financial control specialists are focusing on activities such as investigating missing cash deposits and evaluating the processes in stores with consistently poor shrinkage results 
distribution and transportation costs decreased by basis points as a percentage of sales in as compared to  and increased by basis points in as compared to the reduction in distribution and transportation costs as a percentage of sales in is due primarily to a relatively modest increase in transportation costs during a period of increased sales 
factors contributing to this result in included the opening of the zanesville  ohio dc  which supported continued expansion in the number of stores with only a modest increase in store delivery miles  increased trailer utilization as a result of improved routing  and lower fuel costs 
the increase in distribution and transportation costs as a percentage of sales in was due in part to the additional fixed costs associated with establishing the fulton and alachua distribution centers  which were opened in and  respectively

the increased labor expenses incurred in resulted from a decision by the company s management to spend additional funds in this area in order to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to improve store conditions 
the restatement related expenses and the increased store labor costs together accounted for a basis point increase in sg a expense 
excluding the restatement related expenses  sg a expense in would have been billion  or of sales  an increase of over the prior year 
the basis point increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales experienced in was due in part to the fact that store labor  store depreciation and amortization  and store utilities experienced annual increases of  and  respectively  which were all in excess of the company s sales increase of 
the increase in store labor as a percentage of sales was due principally to the additional hours required to complete the store reset program described above see net sales  and the general weakness of same store sales 
the increase in store depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was a result of the number of new stores subject to capital leases

the company recorded million in for the proposed settlement of the restatement related shareholder class action litigation 
see item

forward looking statements risk factors this discussion and analysis contains historical and forward looking information 
the forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company believes the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable  however  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the following the company s reputation and financial condition could be affected by the restatement 
as previously described in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year  on april   the company announced that it had become aware of certain accounting issues that would cause it to restate its audited financial statements for fiscal years and  and to revise the unaudited financial information for the fiscal year that had been previously released by the company 
following this announcement  more than purported class action lawsuits were filed against the company and certain current and former officers and directors of the company  asserting claims under the federal securities laws 
these lawsuits have been consolidated into a single action pending in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee 
in addition  six purported shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in tennessee state court against certain current and former company directors and officers and deloitte touche llp  the company s former independent accountant  and two purported shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee against certain current and former company directors and officers alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties to the company 
the company has also been notified that the sec is conducting an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the company s april   announcement 
as discussed above  the company has entered into settlement agreements with the purported class action plaintiffs and with the lead counsel in the lead shareholders derivative action 
however  such settlement agreements are subject to conditions  including the completion of confirmatory due diligence and court approval 
in the event that these settlement agreements do not become effective  the company will incur additional significant expenditures in defending itself and the company may be exposed to financial losses in excess of the amounts that the company has agreed to pay in the settlement agreements 
in addition  the publicity surrounding the litigation and the sec investigation could affect the company s reputation and have an impact on its financial condition 
the company s business is modestly seasonal with the highest sales occurring during the fourth quarter  and adverse events during the fourth quarter could therefore affect the company s financial condition 
the company realizes a large portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas selling season 
in anticipation of the holidays  the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees 
if for any reason the company s net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms  a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result 
if such an imbalance were to occur  markdowns might be required to minimize this imbalance 
the company s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unbudgeted markdowns 
adverse weather conditions or other disruptions during the peak christmas season could also affect the company s net sales and could make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers 
competition in the retail industry could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business  which is highly competitive 
this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the company s competitive position 
the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers  including mass merchandise  grocery  drug  convenience  variety and other specialty stores 
some of the nation s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates 
the company s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar  dollar tree  fred s  and various local  independent operators 
competitors from other retail categories include cvs  rite aid  walgreens  eckerds  wal mart and kmart 
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors  such as wal mart and kmart  have moved into the company s geographic markets 
the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains 
the company expects a further increase in competition from these national discount retailers 
the company s financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending 
the general slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the company s consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect the company s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
the company s business is dependent on its vendors 
the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors  it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced 
the company may also face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for other reasons  which would adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is heavily dependent on its information systems 
as part of its technology update  the company installed new flatbed scanners in all of its stores and is in the process of installing new ibm registers and checkouts 
the company depends on a variety of other information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company s business 
the software programs supporting many of the company s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers 
the inability of these developers to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company s operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the company may utilize a credit facility to fund working capital requirements  which is comprised of variable rate debt 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its distribution network 
the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to its distribution centers from vendors  and from the distribution centers to its stores by various means of transportation  including shipments by air  sea and truck on the roads and highways of the united states 
long term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service will adversely affect the company s business 
the company is dependent on the continued availability of capital to support its business 
as discussed above  in september the company s synthetic leases  in the amount of million  will mature and the company s million revolving credit facility will expire 
the company also expects to fund in the second or third quarter of million in settlement of the class action litigation  as further discussed above 
in addition  the company will continue to need capital to support its plans for future growth 
a decline in the company s generation of cash flow or the inability of the company to obtain financing from third parties would have a material adverse effect on the company 
on october   standard poor s lowered the company s corporate credit  senior unsecured debt and senior unsecured bank loan ratings from bbb to bbb  as the date hereof  these ratings remain on creditwatch with negative implications 
on october   moody s investors service  inc also lowered the company s senior unsecured credit rating  from baa to ba  which rating is on review for further possible downgrades 
credit ratings are generally used by investors to assess the ability of a company to meet its obligations 
the downgrade in the company s credit ratings may affect the company s ability to obtain financing in the future  and will also affect the terms of any such financing 
moreover  in order to issue debt securities to the public  the company will have to comply with the registration requirements of the securities and exchange commission  including among other things the requirement that the company disclose selected financial information for a period of five fiscal years 
this may require the company to restate its financial statements for periods prior to the fiscal year 
unless and until it is able to do so  the company will not be able to access the public capital markets and as a result will be limited to non public sources of financing  which may result in increased costs  less favorable terms  and or lesser availability than might be obtainable in the public capital markets 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements made herein  since the statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates 
to minimize such risk  the company may periodically use financial instruments  including derivatives 
as a matter of policy  the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to board of directors approval 
all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 
the financial instruments used by the company are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates  primarily associated with its revolving line of credit and certain lease obligations  and seeks to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swaps 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
at february   and february   the fair value of the company s debt  excluding capital lease obligations  was estimated at approximately million and million  respectively  based on the estimated market value of the debt at those dates 
such fair value is less than the carrying value of the debt at february   and february   by approximately million and million  respectively 
at february   the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the company designated this agreement as a hedge of its floating rate commitments relating to a portion of its synthetic lease agreements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company will pay a fixed rate of and will receive a floating rate libor on the million notional amount through september  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was million at february  the counterparty to the company s interest rate swap agreement was a major financial institution 
the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by such counterparty  the amount of which exposure is limited to the unpaid portion of amounts due to the company pursuant to the interest rate swap agreement  if any 
although there are no collateral requirements if a downgrade in the credit rating of the counterparty occurs  the company believes that its exposure is mitigated by provisions in the interest rate swap agreement that allow the company to offset any amounts payable by the company to the counterparty with any amounts due to the company from the counterparty 
at february   the company was party to the same interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the agreement  the company paid the same fixed rate of and received the same floating rate libor on the million notional amount 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was million at february  in fiscal  as required by sfas  the company recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap in the balance sheet  with the offsetting  effective portion of the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
amounts recorded in other comprehensive income were reclassified into earnings  as an adjustment to interest expense  in the same period during which the hedged synthetic lease agreements affected earnings 
in fiscal  as required by the accounting literature for derivatives and hedging instruments in effect at that time  the company recognized any differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense 
based upon the company s variable rate borrowing levels  a change in interest rates would have resulted in a pre tax loss in earnings and cash flows of approximately million and million  including the effects of interest rate swaps  in and  respectively 
in  the company does not anticipate the potential loss due to a change in interest rates to vary materially from the estimated impact in
