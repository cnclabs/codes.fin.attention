overview diedrich coffee  inc is a specialty coffee roaster  wholesaler and retailer 
we sell brewed  espresso based and various blended beverages primarily made from our own fresh roasted premium coffee beans  as well as light food items  whole bean coffee and accessories  through our company operated and franchised retail locations 
we also sell whole bean and ground coffees on a wholesale basis in the office coffee service market  and to other wholesale customers  including restaurant chains and other retailers 
our brands include diedrich coffee  gloria jean s coffees  and coffee people 
we operate a limited number of kiosks under the coffee plantation brand name 
as of july   we owned and operated retail locations and franchised other retail locations under these brands  for a total of retail coffee outlets 
our retail units are located in states and foreign countries 
we have wholesale accounts with office coffee service distributors  chain and independent restaurants  and others 
we operate a large coffee roasting facility in central california that supplies freshly roasted coffee to our retail locations and wholesale accounts 
our predecessor company  carl e 
diedrich sons  inc  commenced operations in orange county  california in  and changed its name to diedrich coffee when its first retail store opened 
diedrich coffee incorporated in california in the company remained a small  family operated business with only three retail locations until  but grew rapidly from to through construction of new diedrich coffee coffeehouses in orange county  and the acquisition of coffeehouses operated under other brands in houston  denver  and san diego  which were converted into diedrich coffee units 
in august  we reincorporated under delaware law as diedrich coffee  inc  and completed an initial public offering of our common stock in september on july   we acquired coffee people  inc under the terms of that transaction  coffee people stockholders received million in cash and million shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was funded from the proceeds of an offering of million shares of our common stock  as well as a new bank credit agreement entered into at that time which included a million term loan 
the brands acquired as a result of the merger include gloria jean s  one of the leaders in the mall coffee store segment with coffee stores in states and foreign countries  coffee people  based primarily in portland  oregon  and coffee plantation  based primarily in phoenix  arizona 
we experienced significant challenges assimilating coffee people  a much larger company  and integrating the operations of both companies into a single organization 
this occurred for several reasons  including the closure by gloria jean s franchisees of a significantly higher than expected number of franchise stores during the first year following the acquisition 
our diedrich coffee franchise area developers failed to meet their development schedules during this same period of time 
the combination of these franchise unit shortfalls in both of our primary brands led to significant revenue  profit and cash flow shortfalls compared to the levels we had projected when negotiating the terms of our bank credit agreement in  including repayment schedules and financial covenants 
as a result of these and other challenges we experienced significant financial difficulties during fiscal on september   we executed an amendment to our bank credit agreement  which  among other things  accelerated the maturity date of all of our bank debt to september  and necessitated the sale of certain of our assets to meet amended terms and covenants  including term loan principal payments required prior to the amended maturity date 
on september   our president and chief executive officer retired and was replaced by j 
michael jenkins 
mr 
jenkins had over years of experience in the restaurant industry  having served as chief executive officer of several large restaurant chains 
upon his arrival  mr 
jenkins immediately conducted a careful review of the strengths and deficiencies of the company in order to identify and implement a prioritized action plan to resolve our liquidity problems 
several significant changes were made as a result of this review  including the immediate termination of development activities and leases for eight of nine new company operated coffeehouses previously planned to open during fiscal  cancellation of plans to expand a repositioning test for our gloria jean s brand in a different retail format and under a modified brand name  and the immediate cessation of all non essential capital and overhead expenditures 
during october  we were notified by nasdaq that we failed to meet a requirement for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
on january   we announced a restructuring plan which included the relocation of gloria jean s administrative support center from central california to diedrich coffee s home office in orange county  california 
the plan also included the elimination of support center positions  the planned closure of four existing locations  and the recording of a  restructuring and asset impairment charge during the third fiscal quarter as a result of these actions 
on january   we were notified by nasdaq of our failure to meet a second requirement for continued listing of our stock 
our board of directors determined that it would be in our existing stockholders best interest for the company to seek an equity infusion  and on january   we retained an investment banking firm to assist us in the process of raising additional equity capital 
our management subsequently met with a number of potential investors who had expressed interest in investing in the company  and who had executed strict confidentiality agreements  including trading prohibitions 
as a result of this process  in february  a special committee of our board of directors approved  and we entered into a letter of intent with a group of new and current investors  for a sale of newly issued shares of our common stock and warrants 
on may  a special stockholders meeting was held  and our stockholders approved this transaction  as well as a one for four reverse stock split and an increase in the number of authorized shares of our stock 
under the terms of the transaction  we sold  shares pre stock split of common stock at per share  for gross proceeds of million 
the investors also received warrants to purchase an additional  shares pre stock split in the future at per share pre stock split  exercisable for ten years  as well as registration rights requiring us to register all shares to be sold under the transaction 
after the repayment of million of bank debt from the proceeds of the offering  and approximately  of associated transaction costs  we retained net proceeds of approximately million 
the cash conservation measures noted above  in conjunction with this equity infusion and related debt reduction  significantly improved our financial condition  and on april   we were notified by nasdaq that we met all requirements for continued listing of our stock 
on may  we sold our three company operated coffeehouses in houston  texas to a franchisee 
several months later  in october  we sold our interest in the coffee plantation trademarks and brand  and sold or otherwise exited all company operated retail units in arizona with the exception of three kiosks on a college campus 
we used half of the net proceeds of these sales to further reduce our bank debt by million  and retained an equivalent amount to further strengthen our cash working capital resources 
strategically  these divestitures allowed us to focus our limited resources on supporting company store operations in only two geographic markets rather than in four  and more significantly  supporting only three separate brands going forward rather than four 
accordingly  these sales were an important component of our overall action plan to improve the financial strength of the company 
on may   we announced that j 
michael jenkins  our chief executive officer  had passed away after failing to recover from gastric cancer 
philip g 
hirsch  who had commenced his employment with us in the role of interim ceo when mr 
jenkins resigned from diedrich coffee shortly before his death  assumed the role of chief executive officer effective september  on september   we entered into a new credit agreement with united california bank in order to  among other things  repay the balance of all remaining amounts owed to fleet national bank under our prior credit agreement 
we immediately borrowed  under the new agreement  and repaid all amounts owed to fleet on september   the amended maturity date of our loan from fleet 
the terms of our new credit agreement are discussed in detail below  under the caption outstanding debt and financing arrangements  and in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total revenue of certain items included in the company s statements of income for the years indicated year ended july  year ended june  year ended june  net revenue retail sales wholesale and other franchise revenue total revenue cost and expenses cost of sales and related occupancy costs operating expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses provision for asset impairment and restructuring costs gain on asset disposals total operating income loss interest expense and other  net income loss before income tax provision income tax provision net income loss year ended july  compared to year ended june  total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease consisted of decreases in retail sales and wholesale and other sales  partially offset by an increase in franchise revenue 
each component is discussed below 
retail sales revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease represented the net impact of three factors 
first  the number of company stores decreased in the current year versus the prior year because of the closure of eight poorly performing company operated locations since the prior year period and the sale of twelve company operated coffee plantation coffeehouses 
the impact of the reduction in retail sales from the unit closures and sales noted above was approximately  a summary of company and franchise retail unit activity for both fiscal and can be found above under the caption diedrich coffee s business model retail outlets 
second  our fiscal year ended july  contained weeks  whereas our fiscal year ended june  included only weeks 
the impact of this extra week on comparable store sales was an increase in retail sales of  during the year ended july  over the prior year 
finally  the balance of the  decrease resulted from a decrease in comparable store sales for company operated units during the year ended july  as compared to the prior year 
wholesale revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily the net result of the following factors sale of non coffee products to gloria jean s franchisees 
sales of non coffee products decreased by  for the year ended july   a decrease versus the prior year 
these products include paper cups  napkins  sweetener packets  coffee stirrers and coffee related merchandise  such as ceramic mugs and novelties sold in our gloria jean s mall based coffee stores 
we began eliminating most of these lower margin or lower turnover products during fiscal in order to increase our focus on our core coffee operations 
franchisees now purchase these items directly from outside distributors 
roasted coffee sales to franchisees 
sales of roasted coffee to our franchisees decreased  for the year ended july  because of a decrease in the number of domestic franchise stores in the current year 
this resulted from the closure of domestic franchise locations and the transfer of domestic franchise locations to company locations 
the decrease in domestic store count was compounded by lower sales volumes at open stores 
gloria jean s system comparable sales decreased versus the prior year period  further reducing roasted coffee usage 
coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers 
wholesale coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers decreased  or from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to the loss of two chain restaurant accounts since the prior year 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales increased by  for the year ended july   a increase over the prior year 
this is a continuation of a trend over the past months  as we continue to experience solid growth in this line of business 
as noted in our quarterly reports  shortly after the end of the third quarter  we became aware of a potential product failure regarding certain production runs of keurig k cups produced and shipped during the third quarter 
we immediately notified our wholesale distribution customers of the potential problem and offered to replace any inventory which could be affected 
as of july   all replacement product had been shipped  and revenue had been recognized 
holiday gift basket sales 
holiday gift basket sales increased  or  for the year ended july  versus the prior year due to a change in the gift basket program 
during the prior year  we sold only the roasted coffee component of the holiday gift baskets to a distributor  who then purchased the remaining components of the gift baskets and sold the finished product to our franchisees 
during the current year  we purchased all non coffee components and sold the finished gift baskets directly to our franchisees 
franchise revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  franchise revenue consists of initial franchise fees and franchisee renewal fees  area development fees  royalties received on sales at franchised locations  and miscellaneous other franchise revenue as discussed in the table under revenue recognition in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the increase in franchise revenue in fiscal versus fiscal is the net impact of several factors 
franchise royalties increased by  for the year ended july  versus the prior year 
this was the net impact of a reduction in domestic franchise royalties and an increase in international royalties 
domestic royalties decreased because of the unit reduction in domestic franchise stores and a decline in comparable store sales 
international royalties increased because of an increase in the number of units 
initial franchise fees and franchise renewal fees decreased  for the year ended july  versus the prior year  as a result of fewer franchise agreements signed 
miscellaneous other franchise revenue decreased slightly by  compared to the prior year 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs for the year ended july  decreased to  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  cost of sales and related occupancy costs decreased to of total revenue during fiscal versus during fiscal this is the impact of a margin basis point decrease in occupancy costs 
the occupancy cost margin improvement resulted primarily from the sale and closure of several under performing units with high occupancy costs as a percentage of sales  as discussed above in the explanation of the change in retail sales 
in addition  we reversed  in closed store reserves  as settlement amounts came out lower than expected 
these reversals were offset by  in additional store closure costs expensed this year 
cost of sales remained constant at of total revenue for both the year ended july  and the year ended june  as noted above  shortly after the end of the third fiscal quarter  we became aware of a product defect regarding certain production runs of keurig k cups produced and shipped during the third quarter 
during our fourth quarter  we shipped replacement product at a total cost to us of  had this product defect not occurred  cost of sales would have decreased to of total revenue for the year ended july   a margin basis point improvement from the prior year 
this potential margin basis point improvement would have resulted from the favorable margin impact of discontinuing the sale of lower margin non coffee product lines  as noted above in the discussion of changes in wholesale revenue  as well as the closure of eight poorly performing stores as noted above in the discussion of changes in retail revenue 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended july  decreased by to  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  operating expenses decreased to of revenue during fiscal versus during fiscal this favorable margin basis point change resulted from several factors 
first  average operating margins improved from the closure of eight poorly performing locations and the sale of twelve other locations as discussed above 
second  wholesale and bad debt expense declined significantly as a result of a number of new collection policy initiatives implemented since the prior year 
because of these new collection policy initiatives significant amounts that had previously been reserved for were recovered  and the  in related bad debt reserves were reversed during the year  as follows  during the first quarter   during the second quarter   during the third quarter  and  during the fourth quarter 
the  in bad debt reserve reversals was partially offset by  in expense recognized for new receivable amounts which were deemed to become uncollectible during the year 
these favorable factors were offset somewhat by a decrease in comparable store sales versus the prior year and an increase in our medical benefit and workers compensation insurance rates in california 
many operating expenses in a retail unit are semi fixed and  therefore  represent a higher percentage of revenue when retail sales decline 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  to  for the year ended july   from  for the year ended june   of this decrease is due to our adoption of sfas as of the beginning of fiscal year as required under sfas  we have completed a goodwill impairment test as of june   determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of this date  and discontinued periodic amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense was recorded during the prior year period 
in addition  depreciation decreased due to the closure of eight locations and the sale of twelve locations discussed above 
also  certain assets at our castroville roasting facility were fully depreciated during the year ended july  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue for the year ended july  from of total revenue for the year ended june  this unfavorable margin basis point change for the year ended july  resulted from several factors 
as noted above  our medical benefit and workers compensation insurance rates in california increased during the year ended july  this increase was largely offset by a restructuring plan specifically intended to reduce overhead 
this restructuring plan eliminated ten support center positions in january asset impairment and restructuring costs 
asset impairment and restructuring costs decreased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  associated with five of our company locations 
this charge was partially offset by an asset impairment reversal of  to write up the book value of a parcel of land based on proceeds received from its subsequent sale 
at the end of fiscal  we agreed to retake possession of four arizona locations  which we had sold in fiscal a charge of  was recorded to reflect the net present value of the remaining lease obligations on these four locations 
in addition  we recorded severance costs and related employee benefits of  associated with the elimination of ten support center positions 
during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  for twelve coffee plantation stores located in arizona and  relating to property in portland  oregon which was held for sale  and  in impairment charges associated with four company and one franchise operated locations 
a charge of  was also recorded to reflect the net present value of our remaining lease obligations on four of the twelve arizona locations 
in addition   in severance costs associated with the relocation of gloria jean s support center and the related elimination of a number of administrative positions  and  in estimated lease termination costs for the planned closure of four under performing company operated locations  were recorded in fiscal gain on asset disposals 
gain on asset disposals increased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june   primarily due to the fact that stores were either closed or sold during the year ended july  as opposed to only stores closed or sold during the year ended june  interest expense and other  net 
interest expense and other  net decreased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in our bank note payable from  at june  to  at july   and to a lesser degree  to a reduction in our floating interest rate 
income tax expense 
net operating losses generated in previous years resulted in no federal income tax liability and only a nominal amount of state income tax expense for the years ended july  and june  due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating losses have been fully reserved 
the slight fluctuation in expense between fiscal versus fiscal is due to changes in state income taxes owed in conjunction with the portfolio of company operated gloria jean s units  which are located in a variety of states 
as of july   a net operating loss for federal income tax purposes of  is available to be utilized against future taxable income for years through fiscal  subject to possible annual limitations pertaining to change in ownership rules under the internal revenue code 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended june  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease consisted of decreases in retail sales  wholesale sales  and franchise revenue 
each component is discussed below 
retail sales revenue for the year ended june  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease is the net impact of a  increase in retail sales from an increase in the number of company store operating weeks versus the earlier period  which was more than offset by a decrease in comparable store sales over the same period of time 
note that the number of operating weeks for company stores was higher during fiscal versus fiscal despite the fact that there were fewer company stores at the end of the later period 
this resulted from the relative timing of openings and closings of company stores in each of the two years 
for example  a gloria jean s store transferred from franchise to company operations near the end of fiscal  therefore  while it represented one company store at the end of both periods  it contributed weeks of company store operations during fiscal versus only eight weeks in fiscal  or an increase of company store operating weeks in fiscal versus the earlier period 
a summary of company and franchise retail unit activity for both fiscal and can be found above under the caption business diedrich coffee s business model retail outlets wholesale revenue for the year ended june  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily the net result of the following coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers 
wholesale coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers decreased  or  from the prior year as we shifted our emphasis from sales to restaurants and specialty retailers to sales to our office coffee service wholesale accounts 
sale of non coffee products to gloria jean s franchisees 
sales of non coffee products decreased by  for the year ended june   a decrease versus the prior year 
these products include paper cups  napkins  sweetener packets  coffee stirrers  and coffee related merchandise such as ceramic mugs and novelties sold in our gloria jean s mall based coffee stores 
we began eliminating most of these lower margin or lower turnover product lines during fiscal in order to increase focus on our core coffee operations 
franchisees now purchase these items directly from outside distributors 
roasted coffee sales to franchisees 
sales of roasted coffee to our franchisees decreased  for the year ended june  primarily attributable to the closure of franchised locations during the current year 
the reduction in coffee sales due to fewer units was offset by a slightly higher sales volume at open stores 
gloria jean s system comparable sales increased by versus the prior period 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales increased by  for the year ended june   a  increase over the prior year as our entry into this market was only in its initial stages of development during fiscal holiday gift basket sales 
holiday gift basket sales increased  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   as our gift basket program was not fully developed until fiscal prior to fiscal  the gift basket program was handled by a third party company to whom we sold the coffee 
franchise revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  franchise revenue consists of initial franchise fees and franchisee renewal fees  area development fees  royalties received on sales at franchised locations  and miscellaneous other franchise revenue 
the increase in franchise revenue is the net impact of a  increase in initial franchise fees  franchise fees  and area development fees  and a smaller increase in other franchise revenue  which was partially offset by a slight reduction in franchise royalties 
the net royalty reduction resulted from fewer domestic franchise operating weeks versus the prior year  the unfavorable impact of which more than offset the favorable impact from an increase in the number of international franchise unit operating weeks 
international franchise units have a lower average royalty rate than domestic franchise units 
see also the table under revenue recognition in note to the attached consolidated financial statements 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs for the year ended june  decreased to  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  cost of sales and related occupancy costs decreased to of total revenue during fiscal versus during fiscal this represents a favorable margin basis point change 
this favorable margin basis point change was the combined impact of a favorable cost of sales margin basis point change and a favorable related occupancy margin basis point change 
the favorable cost of sales component resulted from the favorable margin impact of discontinuing the sale of lower margin non coffee product lines  as noted above in the discussion of changes in wholesale revenue 
in addition  both cost of sales and occupancy cost margins improved because of the sale and closure of certain under performing units with high cost of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales  as discussed in the explanation of the change in retail sales above 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  operating expenses increased to of revenue during fiscal versus during fiscal this unfavorable margin basis point change is due to unfavorable changes versus fiscal in the relationship of operating costs for company retail units  most notably labor and utilities  to the retail sales from those locations  and resulted primarily from the comparable store sales decrease versus fiscal noted above 
labor  utilities and certain other operating expenses in a retail unit are semi fixed  rather than completely variable based upon volume  and therefore represent a higher percentage of revenue when retail sales in existing locations decline 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by  to  for the year ended june   or of revenue  from  for the year ended june   or only of revenue 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in goodwill amortization expense  resulting from a reduction in the amortization period for goodwill 
during fiscal  all goodwill associated with the coffee people acquisition was amortized based upon an assumed year useful life 
beginning in fiscal  the estimated useful lives of goodwill components were reevaluated and assigned year or year remaining useful lives  depending upon whether they related to franchise operations acquired or company store operations acquired  respectively 
in addition  the increase in company store operating weeks versus fiscal because of unit count changes  as noted above  resulted in additional depreciation expense versus the prior year pertaining to company operated coffeehouses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to during fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was the result of several factors 
first  significant non recurring overhead expenses associated with the initial integration of the coffee people acquisition were incurred in fiscal  the first year following the acquisition 
in addition  significant expenses were incurred in fiscal in conjunction with the recruitment of a number of new senior management personnel to support anticipated rapid national expansion of the diedrich coffee franchise system  including recruitment and relocation costs 
such integration and staffing expenses were not significant in fiscal second  during october  the company implemented a number of measures specifically intended to reduce overhead  and in january we announced a restructuring plan which included the consolidation of our previously separate support centers for diedrich coffee and gloria jean s  as well as the closure of division field offices in portland  oregon and phoenix  arizona  and the elimination of overhead positions 
approximately one half of the expected annualized savings from these measures was realized during fiscal  representing favorable overhead expense comparisons versus fiscal asset impairment and restructuring costs 
asset impairment and restructuring costs decreased to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  during fiscal  the company recorded asset impairment charges of  for twelve coffee plantation stores located in arizona and  relating to property in portland which was held for sale  and  in impairment charges associated with four company and one franchise operated locations 
a charge of  was also recorded to reflect the net present value of our remaining lease obligations on four of the twelve arizona locations 
in addition   in severance costs associated with the relocation of gloria jean s support center and the related elimination of a number of administrative positions  and  in estimated lease termination costs for the planned closure of four under performing company operated locations  were recorded in fiscal during the year ended june   the company recorded  in asset impairment and restructuring charges due to the write down of goodwill associated with the coffee people acquisition 
interest expense and other  net 
interest expense and other  net increased slightly to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to a reduction in interest income in fiscal versus fiscal the company had sizable cash reserves on deposit in interest bearing accounts during the first two quarters of fiscal  immediately following receipt of cash proceeds from a public stock offering and a new bank term loan which financed the coffee people acquisition  and to a lesser degree  during the last two months of fiscal following an equity infusion in may average cash balances deposited in interest bearing accounts were therefore higher during fiscal than in fiscal  as were average interest rates earned on such cash balances 
income tax expense 
net operating losses generated in the years ended june  and june  resulted in no federal income tax liability and only a nominal amount of state income tax expense for those periods 
due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating losses have been fully reserved 
the slight fluctuation in expense between fiscal versus fiscal is due to changes in state income taxes owed in conjunction with the portfolio of company operated gloria jean s units  which are located in a variety of states 
as of june   a net operating loss for federal income tax purposes of  is available to be utilized against future taxable income for years through fiscal  subject to possible annual limitations pertaining to change in ownership rules under the internal revenue code 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources current financial condition at july   diedrich coffee had working capital of  total assets of  and  of stockholders equity  compared to a working capital deficit of  total assets of  and  of stockholders equity at june  cash flows cash provided by operating activities totaled  for the year ended july  as compared to cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended june  this improvement is the net result of many factors more fully enumerated in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended july  totaled  as compared with  in net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  during the year ended july   we received  in proceeds from the sale of assets  including  for the sale of twelve company operated locations in arizona   for the sale of land and a building in oregon  and  for the sale of one company operated location in hawaii 
we also received  in principal payments on notes receivable that were issued by the buyer of the twelve locations in arizona 
these proceeds and notes receivable payments were partially offset by  in property and equipment expenditures 
during the year ended june   the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the fact that proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment were slightly greater than capital expenditures for property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended july   consisting of  in principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations and  in payments related to transaction costs associated with our issuance of common stock during our fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by financing activities totaled  for the year ended june  this consisted of  in net proceeds received from the issuance of  shares pre reverse split of our common stock  net of  in principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
outstanding debt and financing arrangements on july   we entered into a credit agreement with bankboston  na subsequently merged into fleet national bank  which was secured by a pledge of all of our assets and our subsidiaries stock 
it initially provided for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
we did not draw down any borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the time it was in place  although the credit facility currently backs  of outstanding letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement did bear interest  at our option  at fleet s base rate plus or an adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
at july   the applicable interest rate was  which was based on the eurodollar rate at the time 
the rate could be fixed over periods ranging from one to six months  at the company s discretion 
on september   we entered into a first amendment to the credit agreement with fleet  to amend certain terms of the original credit agreement the first amendment accelerated the maturity date of all remaining amounts owed under the credit agreement to the first business day following august   or september  in addition  the first amendment specified assets that could be sold by the company  including two pieces of owned real property under existing company operated retail locations  and a vacant parcel of owned but undeveloped real property 
the first amendment also permitted the company to sell certain company operated coffeehouses outside of southern california on a franchise basis 
the terms of the first amendment required that fleet receive of the net proceeds from any of our asset or equity sales 
in january  two of the aforementioned pieces of real property were sold in a sale leaseback transaction for   of the proceeds from the transaction was remitted to fleet to pay down debt 
in may  three company operated coffeehouses in texas were sold for an aggregate of   of the proceeds from the sale was remitted to fleet 
also in may  we sold  shares post split of our common stock in a private sale 
 of the proceeds from the sale was remitted to fleet 
in october  twelve company operated coffeehouses in arizona were sold for an aggregate of  in cash and  in notes receivable 
one half of the cash payment   was remitted to fleet 
in december  a parcel of real property along with a building were sold in a sale leaseback transaction for   of the proceeds from this sale was remitted to fleet 
in may  a company operated coffeehouse located in hawaii was sold for  in cash 
 of the proceeds was remitted to fleet 
the proceeds from all six sales discussed above were applied solely to reduce the principal balance of our debt to fleet 
additional changes under the terms of the first amendment to credit agreement included a reduction in the maximum amount available to us under the revolving credit facility from  to  and a restriction that henceforth the credit facility be used only to back up letters of credit 
the first amendment to credit agreement preserved our ability to obtain third party financing for capital projects and maintenance capital  and increased our flexibility to obtain subordinated debt as a source of additional working capital 
under the first amendment to credit agreement  fleet waived the previous financial covenant defaults and agreed to new financial covenant ratios going forward based upon updated financial information and projections we had prepared 
in addition to agreeing to reset the ratios previously contained in the financial covenants  we and fleet agreed to a new covenant under the first amendment that required us to achieve certain predetermined minimum levels of cumulative principal repayments  in addition to any amounts we had already repaid to date at the time of the first amendment and in addition to the revised minimum monthly principal payment obligations discussed above  by march   by june   and  by september  we successfully met all such incremental principal repayment obligations to fleet before the dates specified above  and we generated the funds to do so primarily from the net proceeds of the above mentioned asset sales and stock issuance 
on september  we entered into a new credit agreement with united california bank  doing business as bank of the west  or bow  in order to repay the balance of all remaining amounts owed to fleet under our amended credit agreement with fleet 
under the bow credit agreement  we immediately borrowed  under a replacement term loan  the proceeds of which were used to repay our fleet term loan on september   the amended maturity date of the fleet term loan 
our obligations to bow under the credit agreement are secured by all of our assets  including the stock of each of our subsidiaries each of which guarantees our obligations under the agreement  as well as all intangible assets we own  including the intellectual property and trademark assets that we and our subsidiaries own 
the term loan with bow requires monthly principal payments of  over months and all amounts we owe under the term loan must be repaid by march  we are required to make monthly interest payments on amounts outstanding under the replacement term loan  computed at either bow s prime rate plus or a libor rate plus 
we may periodically elect to convert portions of our prime rate borrowings into libor based borrowings in  increments  subject to restrictions contained in the agreement 
in addition to the term loan  the bow credit agreement provides us with a revolving  credit line for the acquisition of specified coffee packaging equipment 
any amounts we borrow under this line will convert to term loans with monthly principal amortization payments beginning september   and we must repay all outstanding balances by august  we are required to pay interest on any borrowings outstanding under this line of credit on a monthly basis  at an interest rate computed in the same manner as described above for the term loan 
the bow credit agreement also provides us with two separate  lines of credit for new coffeehouse development  one applicable to borrowings during our fiscal year ending in  and the other to borrowings during our fiscal year ending in borrowings under each line of credit will convert to term loans repayable over months  with such repayments beginning july  and due in full by june   in the case of borrowings under the fiscal line  and beginning july  and due in full by june   in the case of the fiscal line 
we are required to pay interest on borrowings under each line of credit on a monthly basis  computed as described above 
finally  the bow credit agreement provides us with a  revolving working capital and letter of credit facility  subject to a number of restrictions 
our working capital facility draws and letters of credit are limited to a combined maximum of  outstanding at any time 
furthermore  draw downs against our working capital facility are subject to a sub limit of  and letters of credit are subject to a sub limit of  we may only draw funds against our working capital facility during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  although letters of credit issued under the letter of credit facility may be outstanding throughout the year 
we may repay amounts that we borrow under the working capital facility at any time  and we may therefore be able to re borrow such funds on a revolving basis subject to restrictions including those summarized above 
all amounts outstanding under our new working capital facility are required to be repaid by august  any payments made by bow with regard to any letter of credit issued under the letter of credit facility must be repaid by us immediately upon the date of such payment by bow 
as of september   bow issued two stand by letters of credit  which back the two outstanding fleet letters of credit discussed above 
we are subject to a number of additional restrictions under our new credit agreement 
these include limitations on our ability to sell assets  make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  permit new liens upon our assets  and pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock 
we must also maintain compliance with agreed upon financial covenants that limit the amount of indebtedness that we may have outstanding in relation to our tangible net worth  require us to maintain a specified minimum dollar value level of tangible net worth  require us to maintain a specified minimum dollar value level of ebitda for the trailing four fiscal quarters  require us to maintain a specified minimum level of profitability  and require us to maintain minimum aggregate cash balances in our various bow bank accounts of at least  for all but ten business days each fiscal year 
based upon the terms of our new bank credit agreement  our recent operating performance and business outlook  and status of our balance sheet  we believe that cash  cash from operations  and funds available under our new credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs at the anticipated operating levels for at least the next twelve months 
other commitments the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of july  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands note payable    capital leases  operating leases      green coffee commitments    we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for our coffee houses  roasting facility and administrative offices 
lease terms are generally for ten to twenty years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
some retail leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
in addition  we are contingently liable on the master leases for franchise locations 
under our historical franchising business model  we executed the master leases for these locations  and entered into subleases on the same terms with our franchisees  who pay their rent directly to the landlords 
should any of these franchisees default on their subleases  we would be responsible for the remaining lease payments 
our maximum theoretical future exposure at july   computed as the sum of all remaining lease payments through the expiration dates of the respective leases  was  this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations  or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump sum payment to the landlord less than the sum of all remaining future rents 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
accounts significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  franchise receivables  allowance for bad debt reserves  assets held for sale  fixed asset lives  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  self insurance and workers compensation reserves  store closure reserves  and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion  however  does not list all of our accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition franchise operations initial franchise fees are recognized when a franchised coffeehouse begins operations  at which time the company has performed its obligations related to such fees 
fees received pursuant to area development agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised units in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized on a pro rata basis as the franchised units subject to the development agreements begin operations 
in light of our revenue recognition policies  we have little or no control over when we recognize revenue related to these initial franchise fees and area development fees 
we monitor the financial condition of franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make required payments to us 
if sales or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial performance may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume their responsibility for lease payments on franchised restaurants 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of assets for impairment when the operations of one or more of our brands experience a negative event  including  but not limited to  a significant downturn in sales  a substantial loss of customers  an unfavorable change in demographics or unit closures 
upon the occurrence of a negative event  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows for the individual units that are affected by the negative event 
if the projected cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets allocated to each unit  we write down the assets to fair value based on the estimated net proceeds we believe we can obtain for the unit upon sale  the discounted projected cash flows derived from the unit or the historical net proceeds obtained from sales of similar units 
the most significant assumptions in our analysis are those used when we estimate a unit s future cash flows 
we generally use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on unit specific information 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating unit assets may be overstated or understated 
goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and  business combinations  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company chose to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective june  the company adopted sfas no 
immediately upon its release 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the carrying value of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets was determined to not be impaired 
our goodwill impairment analysis uses estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated 
store closure reserves we decide whether to close a unit based on its recent cash flows and its future estimated profitability 
we evaluate each unit s performance each financial period 
when units perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location as well as our ability to cause an unprofitable unit to become profitable 
based on management s judgment  we estimate the future cash flows of the unit 
if we determine that the unit will not be profitable  and there are no contractual requirements that require us to continue to operate the unit  we close the unit 
we establish a reserve for the net present value of the unit s future rents and other fixed costs 
the most significant assumptions we make in determining store closure reserves are assumptions regarding the estimated costs to maintain vacant properties 
additionally  the amount of the reserve established for future lease payments on leased vacant units is dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination lease agreements with our landlords 
if the costs to maintain properties rise or if it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or terminate leases  we may need to record additional reserves 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement on financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for retirement obligations 
statement no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
statement no

in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement on financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
statement no 
provides new guidance on the criteria used to classify debt extinguishments as extraordinary items and requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
statement no 
will be effective for our fiscal year management does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation  or liquidity 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities 
statement no 
requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by statement no 
include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing or other exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
we have not assessed whether the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation  or liquidity 
other matters seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as well as economic trends that affect retailers in general 
historically  our net sales have not been realized proportionately in each quarter  with net sales being the highest during the last fiscal quarter  which includes the november december holiday season 
hot weather tends to reduce sales 
quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  which may not occur as anticipated due to events outside our control 
as a result of these factors  and of the other contingencies and risk factors described elsewhere in this report  the financial results for any individual quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved in a full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive items entered into for trading purposes none 
market risk sensitive items entered into for other than trading purposes we have exposure to market risk from two primary sources interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding bank debt 
at july   we had  in bank debt that was tied to changes in short term interest rates 
at year end  the interest rate was the adjusted eurodollar rate plus  or 
the rate can be fixed over periods ranging from one to six months  at our discretion 
at july   a hypothetical basis point increase in the adjusted eurodollar rate would result in additional interest expense of  on an annualized basis 
commodity price risk green coffee  the principal raw material for our products  is subject to significant price fluctuations caused by a number of factors  including weather  political  and economic conditions 
to date  we have not used commodity based financial instruments to hedge against fluctuations in the price of coffee 
to ensure that we have an adequate supply of coffee  however  we enter into agreements to purchase green coffee in the future that may or may not be fixed as to price 
at july   we had commitments to purchase coffee through fiscal year  totaling  for  pounds of green coffee  all of which were fixed as to price 
the coffee scheduled to be delivered to us in fiscal year pursuant to these commitments will satisfy approximately of our anticipated green coffee requirements for this fiscal year 
assuming we require approximately  additional pounds of green coffee during fiscal for which no price has yet been fixed  each per pound increase in the price of green coffee could result in  of additional cost 
however  because the price we pay for green coffee is negotiated with suppliers  we believe that the commodity market price for green coffee would have to increase significantly  as much as per pound  before suppliers would increase the price they charge us
