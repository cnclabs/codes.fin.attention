the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  and the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
general we are the second largest provider of natural gas contract compression  sales  operations  maintenance and fabrication services to the natural gas industry in terms of compression fleet horsepower  with one of the largest natural gas compressor fleets in the united states and a strong presence in key international markets 
we were formed in december to acquire all of the outstanding stock of tidewater compression service  inc upon completion of the acquisition in february  tidewater compression became our wholly owned operating subsidiary and changed its name to universal compression  inc through this subsidiary  our gas compression service operations date back to during the quarter ended june   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share  which provided us with net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million 
concurrently with our initial public offering  we implemented a recapitalization pursuant to which all then existing classes of our stock were converted into common stock 
we used the proceeds of the offering and the million in initial proceeds from an operating lease facility to repay million of indebtedness  and the remaining proceeds for working capital and to pay expenses associated with the offering and concurrent financing transactions 
on february   we completed our acquisition of weatherford global for  shares of our common stock approximately of our current total outstanding shares and the restructuring of approximately million in debt and operating lease obligations 
on july   we completed the public offering of  shares of our common stock  together with  shares of our common stock sold by certain selling stockholders  including castle harlan partners iii  lp and its affiliates 
the shares were sold in the offering at a price of per share  and the offering provided us with net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million 
we used the proceeds to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of kci  to repay a portion of kci s indebtedness concurrently with the acquisition and to partially fund the purchase price of our acquisition of lcm 
in addition  we issued  shares of our common stock in the acquisition of kci 
consummation of the july offering  and castle harlan s reduced ownership of our common stock following that offering  gave the holders of universal s senior discount notes the right to require us to repurchase those notes at a price equal to of the accreted value  plus accrued and unpaid interest to date 
as a result  we repurchased approximately million face value of the senior discount notes in august using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
since our initial public offering  we have completed seven acquisitions 
our completed acquisitions include gcsi in september  weatherford global and iew in february  csii in april  kci and lcm in july  and tcsi in october weatherford global was the second largest natural gas compression services company in the world in terms of horsepower 
this acquisition added over  horsepower to our fleet and provided us with a number of important strategic and operational benefits  including expanded international operations  increased aftermarket services business and cost savings and synergies 
critical accounting policies the following policies are important to gain an understanding of our operating results and financial condition and should be considered as an integral part of the financial review 
estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial information  we use some estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
more specifically  in accounting for allowances and reserves  depreciation of fixed assets  operating leases  income taxes  revenues  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation  we must periodically evaluate and adjust  if necessary  our estimates and assumptions as new facts or information becomes available  such as accounting rule changes 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
operating leases a significant portion of our compression equipment fleet is financed through operating leases  which are not recorded as liabilities and the equipment is not recorded as assets on our balance sheet 
this treatment is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
if the operating leases and related equipment were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of march   total liabilities and total assets would have been increased by approximately million 
in addition  if the leased equipment had been recorded as assets on our balance sheet  we would have recorded additional depreciation expense of approximately million and interest expense of approximately million related to this equipment  offset by a reduction of operating lease expense of approximately million on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  allowances and reserves our customers that purchase products and services are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts based on specific customer collection issues and historical experience 
on an ongoing basis  we conduct an evaluation of the financial strength of our customers based on payment history and make adjustments to the allowance as necessary 
since most of our customers are in the energy industry  their ability to pay balances due could be affected by dramatic changes in the price and demand for their products 
depreciation on properties and equipment is computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of years for compression equipment and years for properties and other equipment 
salvage values of are used for compression equipment 
overhauls and major components related to compression equipment are depreciated over periods of years 
overhauls and major improvements that increase the value or extend the life of contract compressor equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated period of years 
we record a reserve against our inventory balance for estimated obsolescence 
this reserve is based on specific identification and historical experience 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for all our business segments using the following criteria a persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from contract compression is recorded when earned over the period of the contract  which generally ranges from one month to several years 
fabrication revenue is recognized using the completed contract method  specifically when all terms of the contract have been completed and title to the product has been transferred 
aftermarket services revenue is recorded as products are delivered and services are rendered

the increase in international contract compression revenue resulted from expansion of our international contract compression fleet primarily through the csii acquisition and the impact of a full year of operations from the weatherford global acquisition 
domestic average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to the kci acquisition and a full year of operations from the weatherford global and gcsi acquisitions 
in addition  international average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily through our acquisitions and expansion of our international contract compression fleet and high utilization rates 
our combined average horsepower utilization rate for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately  up from in the fiscal year ended march  as of march   we had approximately million available horsepower with an average horsepower utilization rate for the quarter then ended of and for the same period one year earlier of 
our revenue from fabrication increased to million from million  an increase of 
the increase in fabrication revenue  consisting mostly of equipment fabrication  was due primarily to our acquisition of kci and the impact of a full year of operations from the weatherford global acquisition combined with internal growth 
revenues from fabrication vary quarter to quarter due to the recognition of revenues only at the time of shipment 
our backlog of fabrication projects at the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  compared with a backlog of million at march  from december  to march   our backlog decreased million 
our revenues from aftermarket services increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march   an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to the impact of a full year of operations from the weatherford global acquisition  and resulted in the aftermarket services segment becoming a more significant part of our business 
in addition  the lcm and tcsi acquisitions increased revenues approximately million in the aggregate 
gross margin 
our gross margin defined as total revenue less rental expense  cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization  gain on asset sales and interest income for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million from gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  our contract compression gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  contract compression gross margin increased primarily as the result of our contract compression revenue growth and operating cost improvements realized by the integration of our contract compression business 
our fabrication gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  fabrication gross margins increased primarily due to the impact of a full year of operations from weatherford global  a partial year of operations from kci and synergies from the integration of these operations 
our aftermarket services gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  aftermarket services gross margin increased primarily due to the impact of a full year of operations from weatherford global and the acquisitions of tcsi and lcm 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  compared to of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  ebitda  as adjusted  for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increases in total fleet horsepower and utilization of the compression contract compression fleet  gross margin contribution from fabrication and sales  and operating cost improvements realized by contract compression operations 
ebitda  as adjusted  is defined as net income plus income taxes  interest expense  leasing expense  management fees  depreciation and amortization  excluding non recurring items and extraordinary gains or losses 
ebitda  as adjusted  is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of its liquidity 
additionally  the ebitda  as adjusted  computation used herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda  as adjusted  represents a measure upon which management assesses financial performance  and financial covenants in our current borrowing arrangements are tied to similar measures 
we believe that ebitda  as adjusted  is a standard measure of financial performance used for valuing companies in the compression industry 
ebitda  as adjusted  is a useful common yardstick as it measures the capacity of companies to generate cash without reference to how they are capitalized  how they account for significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization associated with assets used in the business the majority of which are long lived assets in the compression industry  or what their tax attributes may be 
non recurring charges 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred non recurring charges of million related to the early termination of a management agreement and a consulting agreement and other related fees in connection with our initial public offering and concurrent financing transactions as well as costs related to facilities and workforce reductions associated with our weatherford global acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily due to capital additions of million  which primarily resulted from expansion of our contract compression fleet  through our fabrication operations and the purchase of approximately million and million of contract compression equipment from the acquisitions of kci and csii  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was partially offset by the net sales and leasebacks of compressor equipment  with a book value of approximately million  between april and october under our operating lease facilities 
operating lease 
operating lease expense increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  resulting from the increase in compression equipment leased under our operating lease facilities 
the outstanding balance under the operating lease facilities at march  was million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  remained fairly constant at million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the repayment of the million revenue bonds  offset partially by increased accretion of universal s senior discount notes 
extraordinary loss 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred extraordinary losses of million million net of income tax related to debt restructurings that occurred concurrently with our initial public offering and the weatherford global acquisition 
net income loss 
we had a net income of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million including extraordinary loss of million net of income taxes for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the million increase in our gross margins and interest expense  net  remaining constant at approximately million  offset partially by increased depreciation and amortization of million related to the continued expansion of our assets  increased leasing expense of million resulting from the increase in compression equipment leased under our operating lease facilities  an increase in the income tax provision to million and a decrease in net income of million related to the argentina political and economic situation 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes revenues  cost of sales  gross margins and the respective percentages for each of our business segments year ended march  dollars in thousands revenues domestic contract compression   of revenue international contract compression   of revenue fabrication   of revenue aftermarket services   of revenue gross margin domestic contract compression   international contract compression   fabrication   aftermarket services   expenses depreciation and amortization   selling  general and administrative   operating lease expense  interest expense  net   income taxes   net income loss   revenues 
our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  our contract compression revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  domestic contract compression revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  our international contract compression revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in domestic contract compression revenues primarily resulted from expansion of our contract compression fleet through the acquisition of gcsi  weatherford global and internal growth 
the increase in international contract compression revenues resulted from expansion of our international contract compression fleet primarily through the addition of horsepower from our acquisitions  high utilization rates and the impact of our weatherford global acquisition 
during the quarter ended december   we started our first contract compression project in mexico consisting of  horsepower 
this project contributed approximately million in one time turnkey installation revenues 
domestic average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  international average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily through expansion of our international contract compression fleet  high utilization rates and additional service in latin america 
our average horsepower utilization rate for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately  up from in the fiscal year ended march  as of march   we had approximately million available horsepower with an additional  horsepower operated and maintained for customers 
our average horsepower utilization rate for the quarter ended march  was and at march  was approximately 
these horsepower and utilization amounts include gcsi for the full fourth quarter and weatherford global for the days from the date of the merger 
our revenue from fabrication increased to million from million  an increase of 
the increase in fabrication revenue  consisting mostly of equipment fabrication  was due primarily to our acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
revenues from fabrication vary quarter to quarter due to the recognition of revenues only at the time of shipment 
our backlog of fabrication projects at march  was approximately million  compared with a backlog of million at the same time a year earlier 
from december  to march   our backlog increased million 
our revenues from aftermarket services increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march   an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to our acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
gross margin 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million from gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  our contract compression gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  contract compression gross margin increased primarily as the result of our contract compression revenue growth discussed above and operating cost improvements realized by contract compression operations 
our fabrication gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  fabrication gross margin increased primarily due to strong customer demand  cost reductions and their resulting gross margin effects 
our aftermarket services gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  aftermarket services revenue increased primarily due to our acquisition of weatherford global 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased million compared to the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  compared to of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the percentage decrease was primarily due to the approximately million in one time turnkey installation revenues associated with a large contract compression project in mexico  the elimination of management fees in connection with our initial public offering in may and synergies achieved in our acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
these reductions have been offset partially by increases in certain expenses related to our operating as a publicly traded company 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increases in horsepower and utilization of the compression contract compression fleet  gross margin contribution from fabrication and sales  operating cost improvements realized by contract compression operations  and a decreased percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
non recurring charges 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred non recurring charges of million related to the early termination of a management agreement and a consulting agreement and other related fees in connection with our initial public offering and concurrent financing transactions as well as costs related to facilities and workforce reductions associated with our weatherford global acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our contract compression fleet  offset partially by the compressor equipment sold and leased back under our previous operating lease facility 
operating lease 
we incurred leasing expense of million during the fiscal year ended march  resulting from our operating lease facilities 
the outstanding balance under the operating lease facilities at march  was million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily from the reduction of debt resulting from our initial public offering and financing restructurings 
the decrease in interest expense was offset partially by increased accretion of universal s senior discount notes and the assumption and refinancing of debt related to our gcsi acquisition 
extraordinary loss 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred extraordinary losses of million million net of income tax related to debt restructurings that occurred concurrently with our initial public offering and the weatherford global acquisition 
net income loss 
we had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of an increase in our gross margins and interest expense decreasing from million to million  offset partially by increased depreciation and amortization related to the continued expansion of our assets  leasing expense of million resulting from our operating lease facilities  non recurring charges  an increase of the income tax provision to million from an income tax benefit of million  and an extraordinary loss of million 
effects of inflation in recent years  inflation has been modest and has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance at march  was million  compared to million at march  during the twelve months ended march   cash flows from operations provided million  primarily from net income of million  depreciation of million  and accretion of universal s senior discount notes of million 
during the twelve months ended march   we used million of cash for investing activities  which primarily consisted of million for fixed asset additions  million for acquisitions  largely funded by million from proceeds from sales of compression equipment to our operating lease facilities 
during the twelve months ended march   million of cash was provided by financing activities  which primarily consisted of million from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by repayments of debt of million  issuance costs related to the operating lease facilities of million and payments on capital lease agreements of million 
on july   we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock together with  shares of our common stock sold by certain selling stockholders  including castle harlan 
the shares were sold at a price of per share  and the offering provided us with net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million 
we used the proceeds to fund the million cash portion of the purchase price in our acquisition of kci  to repay a portion of kci s indebtedness concurrently with the acquisition and to partially fund the purchase price of our acquisition of lcm 
pursuant to the indenture governing universal s senior discount notes  the holders of the notes had the right to require universal to repurchase the notes through august  as a result of the consummation of the july equity offering as castle harlan s change in ownership to less than of our common stock constituted a change of control under the indenture 
we repurchased approximately million face value of these notes in august with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of may   universal had approximately million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the senior discount notes 
on october   we completed our acquisition of tcsi for approximately million in cash by using funds available under our revolving credit facility 
on october   we sold an additional million of compression equipment to brl universal equipment a  lp and leased the equipment back under our existing high yield operating lease facility 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the compression equipment to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  to repay a portion of our obligations under our abs operating lease facility  for the payment of other indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
most of the funds used to pay for the compression equipment under the high yield operating lease facility came from the issuance and sale by the issuers  brl universal equipment a  lp and brl universal equipment corp  in october of million aggregate principal amount of additional senior secured notes due issued under an indenture dated february  the october notes increased the notes outstanding under the indenture to an aggregate principal amount of million 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our operating leases aggregate balance of million as of march   was not recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of that date except to the extent of approximately million of deferred gain 
likewise  the leased equipment under the operating leases  representing approximately million horsepower and having a gross and net book value of approximately million and million  respectively  was not recorded as an asset in our march  consolidated balance sheet  and we did not record depreciation of that leased equipment as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations for periods ended on or prior to march  if the operating leases were recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of march   total liabilities would have been increased by approximately million  and if the leased equipment under our operating leases having a gross and net book value  at the date they were sold to the lessors  of million and million  respectively had been recorded as assets on our consolidated balance sheet  total assets would have increased by approximately million less depreciation 
in addition  if the leased equipment had been recorded as assets on our balance sheet  we would have recorded additional depreciation expense of approximately million using our current depreciation life policy and interest expense of approximately million related to this equipment  offset by a reduction of operating lease expense of approximately million on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  under our current policy  depreciation of owned contract compression equipment is generally calculated using the straight line method over a period of years with residual value of 
as of march   our debt to capitalization ratio  including the operating leases  was and our book debt to capitalization ratio  excluding operating leases  was 
working capital for the year ended march  increased compared to march  due to non cash adjustments within the purchase accounting liability balances and changes to the current deferred tax balances 
as of june   subject to covenant and other restrictions  we had unused credit availability of approximately million approximately million under our asset backed securitization facility and million under our revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are expected to be approximately to million for fiscal  with approximately million for domestic expansion  approximately million for international expenditures  approximately million for maintenance capital expenditures and approximately million for general corporate expenditures 
as a result of the political and economic situation in argentina  which began to deteriorate in january  we continue to negotiate with our customers in argentina as to contract amounts to be paid  subject to restrictions by the argentine government 
the majority of our existing contracts were written to ensure that we received united states dollars rather than argentine pesos  which were designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the argentine peso s value 
for the three and twelve month periods ended march   the impact from the argentina situation reduced ebitda  as adjusted  by approximately million 
also  we have recorded a non cash adjustment to stockholders equity at march  of approximately million pertaining to the currency translation of the argentina balance sheet 
under gaap this adjustment is not recorded as an expense in the current statement of operations 
a significant portion of this adjustment is related to compression assets 
we believe that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing cash and the additional capacity available under our revolving credit facility and abs operating lease facility  will be sufficient to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures and internal growth for the remainder of fiscal year if we were to make significant additional acquisitions for cash  we may need to obtain additional debt  equity or operating lease financing 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial acounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principle board opinion no 
 while retaining many of the requirements of these two statements 
under sfas  assets held for sale that are a component of an entity will be included in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations prospectively 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas does not materially change the methods used by the company to measure impairment losses on long lived assets  but may result in additional future dispositions being reported as discontinued operations 
the company adopted sfas on april  based on the company s review of sfas  no impairment existed as of march  seasonal fluctuations our results of operations have not historically reflected any material seasonal tendencies 
risk factors as described in part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements  this report contains forward looking statements regarding us  our business and our industry 
the risk factors described below  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect the company and universal 
risks inherent in our industry we depend on strong demand for natural gas  and a prolonged  substantial reduction in this demand could adversely affect the demand for our services and products 
gas contract compression operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for natural gas 
demand may be affected by  among other factors  natural gas prices  weather  demand for energy and availability of alternative energy sources 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for natural gas would  in all likelihood  depress the level of production  exploration and development activity and result in a decline in the demand for our contract compression services and products 
similarly  a decrease in capital spending by our customers could result in reduced demand for our fabrication or aftermarket services businesses 
these events could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future terrorist attacks or responses thereto could adversely affect our company 
the impact that future events  arising as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   or any terrorist attacks that may occur in the future  including military or police activities in the united states or foreign countries  future terrorist activities or threats of such activities  political unrest and instability  riots and protests  could have on the united states economy  the global economy  global financial markets and our business cannot currently be determined with any accuracy 
we intend to continue to make substantial capital investments to implement our business strategy  which may reduce funds available for other operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to make substantial capital investments to expand our contract compression fleet 
for the year ended march   net of asset sales other than under our operating leases  we invested approximately million in capital investments  excluding acquisitions 
we expect to spend between and million on capital expenditures during fiscal year  excluding acquisitions 
historically  we have financed these investments through internally generated funds  debt and equity offerings and our revolving credit facility and our operating lease facilities 
these significant capital investments require cash that we could otherwise apply to other business needs 
however  if we do not incur these expenditures while our competitors make substantial fleet investments  our market share may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and growth 
we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy  which may adversely affect our ability to finance our future growth 
our ability to implement our business strategy successfully depends upon a number of factors including competition  availability of working capital and general economic conditions 
significant elements of our business strategy include growth of our market share and broader participation in the international market for contract compression services 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in implementing our strategy or be able to obtain financing for this strategy on acceptable terms 
the indenture governing universal s senior discount notes and our revolving credit facility and operating lease facilities substantially limit our ability to incur additional debt to finance our growth strategy 
see business growth strategy 
most of our domestic compressor leases haves short initial terms  and we may not recoup the costs of our investment if we were unable to subsequently re lease the compressors 
in most cases  the initial terms of our contract compression leases with customers are short  with the most common initial term being six months and continuing on a month to month basis thereafter 
the initial terms of our leases are generally too short to enable us to recoup the average cost of acquiring or fabricating compressors for contract compression customers  to the extent applicable 
as a result  we assume substantial risk of not recovering our entire investment in the equipment we acquire or fabricate for contract compression customers 
although we historically have been successful in subsequently leasing our compressors  we may not be able to continue to do so and a substantial number of our contract compression customers could terminate their leases at approximately the same time 
if such an event were to occur  even if we are successful in re leasing our compressors as we have been in the past  we may not be able to obtain favorable contract compression rates 
this would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities 
natural gas service operations are subject to inherent risks such as equipment defects  malfunction and failures  and natural disasters that can result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damages 
although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities 
further  insurance covering the risks we face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or  if available  the premiums may not be commercially justifiable 
if we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits  or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to substantial environmental regulation  and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities 
we are subject to stringent and complex foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulatory standards  including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment  emission controls and other environmental protection and occupational health and safety concerns 
see business environmental and other regulations 
environmental laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering us liable for remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior owners or operators or other third parties 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations  and costs associated with new information  changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we currently are engaged in remediation and monitoring activities with respect to some of our properties 
the cost of these activities has not been  and we currently do not expect it to be  material to us 
we believe that former owners and operators of some of these properties may be responsible under environmental laws and contractual agreements to pay for or perform some of these activities  or to indemnify us for some of our remediation costs 
there can be no assurance that these other entities will fulfill their legal or contractual obligations  and their failure to do so could result in material costs to us 
in addition  we have entered into a settlement agreement with the prior owner of tidewater compression whereby the prior owner s indemnification obligations related to environmental matters have been terminated 
as such  any environmental obligations related to our acquisition of tidewater compression will not be indemnified by the prior owner 
we routinely deal with natural gas  oil and other petroleum products 
as a result of our engineered products and overhaul and field operations  we generate  manage and dispose of or recycle hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  washdown wastes and sandblast material 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigatory  remediation and monitoring requirements under foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
nevertheless  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated service companies 
we face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance 
the contract compression  fabrication  and aftermarket services businesses are highly competitive 
many of our competitors also offer a wide range of compressors for sale or lease  and there are low barriers to entry for individual projects 
in addition  we compete with several large national and multinational companies that provide contract compression services to third parties  most of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
if our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products and services  we may not be able to compete effectively 
in addition  in our weatherford global acquisition  we acquired most  but not all  of the compression operations of weatherford 
weatherford retained certain foreign compression equipment and is not contractually restricted from competing with us 
risks specific to our company we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire  which could cause us not to realize all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions 
we have completed seven acquisitions since our initial public offering in may integrating acquired businesses into ours is an ongoing process involving a number of potential challenges and costs  including combining  reducing and relocating workforces  facilities and offices and combining systems  processes  administrative functions and corporate cultures 
the integration process could cause operational difficulties  divert the attention of our management away from managing our business to the assimilation of the operations and personnel and have adverse effects on our operating results 
furthermore  if our integration of our acquisitions is not successful  we may lose personnel  not be able to retain our customer base to the extent expected and experience increased costs and reduced revenues 
we are highly leveraged  a significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our obligations and in addition we are vulnerable to interest rate increases 
as of june   we had approximately million in outstanding obligations  including capital leases and operating lease facilities 
of this amount  approximately million bears interest at floating rates 
as of that date  we also had unused availability of approximately million million under our revolving credit facility and approximately million under our abs operating lease facility 
both the interest payments under our revolving credit facility and a portion of the lease payments under our operating lease facilities bear interest at a floating rate based on a base rate or libor  at our option  in the case of the revolving credit facility  and based on libor in the case of the operating lease facilities  plus a variable amount depending on our operating results 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest and lease payment rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and lease payments and reducing our funds available for capital investment  operations or other purposes 
if  during the term of the operating lease facilities  the realizable value of the equipment under the facilities is insufficient to satisfy the obligations under the facilities  we may be required to record a loss due to our residual value guarantees and may have insufficient funds to provide for repayment of our obligations 
our significant leverage increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to service our debt and lease obligations  which may affect our ability to make acquisitions or capital expenditures 
our financing arrangements contain restrictions that may limit our ability to finance future operations or engage in attractive business transactions 
a significant portion of our gas compressors are pledged as collateral under operating lease facilities  each of which contains covenants that restrict our operations 
the indenture governing universal s senior discount notes also contains restrictive covenants 
these covenants place limitations on  among other things  our ability to enter into acquisitions  asset sales and operating lease transactions  and to incur additional indebtedness and create liens 
these covenants could hinder our flexibility and restrict our ability to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to changing market conditions 
our international operations subject us to risks that are difficult to predict 
for the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from international operations 
we intend to continue to expand our business in latin america and asia pacific 
our international operations are affected by global political and economic conditions  and we may encounter difficulties managing our international operations 
changes in political or economic conditions and in legal or regulatory requirements in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement  new currency or exchange controls  expropriation or other trade restrictions  including tariffs  being imposed on our operations 
many of these factors are outside of our control 
in addition  the financial condition of foreign customers may not be as strong as that of our current domestic customers 
as a result of the political and economic situation in argentina  we are involved in negotiations with our customers in argentina as to the currency in which contract amounts are to be paid  as mandated by the argentine government 
the impact from the argentina political and economic situation reduced ebitda  as adjusted  by approximately million in the three and twelve month periods ended march  weatherford s voting power may give it the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  and thus limit the rights of our other stockholders to influence our affairs 
currently  an affiliate of weatherford beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition to its voting power  weatherford and its affiliates are entitled to designate three persons to serve on our board of directors for so long as they own at least of our outstanding common stock 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  weatherford may designate only two directors 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  it will no longer have the right to designate directors to our board 
currently  bernard j 
duroc danner  lisa w 
rodriguez and uriel e 
dutton are serving as weatherford s designees to our board 
this significant stock ownership and board representation gives weatherford the ability to exercise substantial influence over our ownership  policies  management and affairs and significant control over actions requiring approval of our stockholders 
weatherford s interests could conflict with our other stockholders 
see item certain relationships and related transactions for further information regarding our relationship with weatherford 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
historically  the market price of common stock of companies engaged in the natural gas industry has been highly volatile 
similarly  the market price of our common stock has varied significantly since our initial public offering in may in particular  changes in natural gas prices or in the demand for natural gas could affect the price of our common stock 
we are dependent on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases 
as a consequence of having a highly standardized contract compression fleet  some of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks  including price increases  inferior component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner 
the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have at least a temporary material adverse effect on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operations may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
our revenues from international operations and  as a result  our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  have increased as a result of our acquisitions 
although we attempt to match costs and revenues in local currencies  we anticipate that as we continue our expansion on a global basis  there may be many instances in which costs and revenues will not be matched with respect to currency denomination 
as a result  we expect that increasing portions of our revenues  costs  assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations 
although we may use foreign currency forward contracts or other currency hedging mechanisms from time to time to minimize our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  we may not elect or have the ability to implement hedges or  if we do implement them  that they will achieve the desired effect 
we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
further  the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency  resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks 
our ability to manage our business effectively will be weakened if we lose key personnel 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
the departure of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage with respect to our executive officers or key management personnel 
we are not aware of the upcoming retirement of any of our executive officers or senior management personnel 
in addition  we believe that our success depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
if we fail to recruit other skilled personnel  we could be unable to compete effectively 
we are a holding company and rely on our subsidiaries for operating income 
we are a holding company and  as such  derive all of our operating income from our operating subsidiary  universal  and its subsidiaries 
we do not have any significant assets other than the stock of our operating subsidiary 
consequently  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that are not legally obligated to make funds available to us  and in some cases may be contractually restricted from doing so 
we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to  or be permitted to  pay to us amounts necessary to meet our obligations 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring control of us because of the anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws 
there are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  such as a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors  no stockholder action by written consent and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors 
we do not expect to pay dividends 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our ability to pay dividends is restricted by our revolving credit facility  our operating lease facilities  the indenture governing universal s senior discount notes and other financing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating or variable interest rates under our financing arrangements 
a portion of the interest and lease payments under our financing arrangements are based on a floating rate a base rate or libor  at our option  in the case of our revolving credit facility  and libor in the case of our operating lease facilities plus a variable amount based on our operating results 
the one month libor rate at march  was 
a increase in interest rates would result in a million annual increase in interest and operating lease expense 
as of march   approximately million of our indebtedness and other obligations outstanding bear interest at floating rates 
in order to minimize any significant foreign currency credit risk  we generally contractually require that payment by our customers be made in united states dollars 
if payment is not made in united states dollars  we generally utilize the exchange rate into united states dollars on the payment date or balance payments in local currency against local expenses 
as a result of the political and economic situation in argentina  we are involved in negotiations with our customers in argentina as to the currency in which contract amounts are to be paid  as mandated by the argentine government 
the impact from the argentina political and economic situation reduced ebitda  as adjusted  by approximately million in the three and twelve month periods ended march
