the company is required to adopt this statement on october  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material affect on its cash flows or the results of its operations 
foreign currency matters the functional currency of each of the company s foreign operations at september  is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  while revenue  expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
effects of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in the company s principal markets  inflation did not have a material impact on its results of operations in fiscal  or critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
the company s accounting policies can be found in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
below is a discussion of the policies that the company believes may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
trade receivables the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts  reducing its receivables balance to an amount the company estimates is collectible from its customers 
management uses significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts  considering numerous factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and current customer performance and customer relationships 
although the company considers its allowances for uncollectible accounts to be adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions or customer circumstances could have a material effect on the reserve balances required 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
inventories the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
management reviews its inventory balances to determine if inventories can be sold at amounts equal to or greater than their recorded values 
the review includes the identification of slow moving inventories  obsolete inventories and 
table of contents discontinued products based on the historical performance of the inventories and current operational plans for inventories  as well as estimated future customer demand for the inventories 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
deferred income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current law  of any temporary differences in the timing of when revenues and expenses are recognized for tax purposes and when they are recognized for financial statement purposes 
management reviews the deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
the company considers expected future income and gains from investments as well as tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain assets  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
if future taxable income is different than expected  the company may need to change its valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
net assets held for sale the company records reserves for the difference between the carrying value and the net realizable value of its net assets held for sale 
these reserves require that management make assumptions about estimated proceeds  based on the demand for these assets and current market conditions  and about estimated costs to sell  based on management s professional knowledge and experience 
the company monitors these reserves on an on going basis and records adjustments to its estimates based on actual results and management s updated knowledge 
goodwill and other intangibles the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy  reporting unit operating results and or market conditions could significantly impact management s judgment and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
management determines the amount of reserves needed  if any  for each individual issue based on their professional knowledge and experience and discussions with legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter  the ultimate resolution of each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters 
pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit income and expense and assets liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions regarding discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  merit and promotion increases and the current health care cost trend rate 
the company considers current market conditions in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit income costs or assets liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
when valuing the pension plans at september  the company reduced its discount rate and expected rate of return on assets 
this change in assumptions will reduce the amount of pension income recognized by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the lower discount rate and increase in current healthcare costs are also expected to increase expenses related to post retirement benefits by approximately million in 
table of contents environmental and asbestos liabilities it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters  including potential liabilities 
the company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
this practice is followed whether the claims are asserted or unasserted 
reserves for estimated losses from environmental remediation are  depending on the site  based primarily upon internal or third party environmental studies  and estimates as to the number  participation level and financial viability of any other prp s  the extent of contamination and the nature of required remedial actions 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present fair value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
management expects that the amount reserved will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites  which range up to years  and that such reserves are adequate based on all current data 
each of the sites in question is at various stages of investigation or remediation  however  no information currently available reasonably suggests that projected expenditures associated with remedial action or compliance with environmental laws for any single site or for all sites in the aggregate  will have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the estimate of zurn s asbestos liability is developed from actuarial valuations and is based on its view of the current and anticipated number of future asbestos claims  the timing and amounts of asbestos payments  the status of ongoing litigation and the potential impact of defense strategies and settlement initiatives 
however  there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimating both the number of future asbestos claims as well as future settlement costs  and the actual liability could exceed zurn s estimate due to changes in facts and circumstances after the date of the estimate 
zurn s present estimate of its asbestos liability is predicated on the assumption that its recent vigorous defense strategy will enable it to reduce both its claim frequency and claim severity in the future 
while zurn believes there is evidence  in recent claims settlements  for such an impact of successful defense strategy  if the defense strategy ultimately is not successful  to the extent assumed by zurn  then severity and frequency of asbestos claims could increase substantially above zurn s estimates 
further  while there is presently no reasonable basis for estimating zurn s asbestos liability beyond  such liability may continue beyond  and such liability could be substantial 
revenue recognition the company records revenue when delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer 
provisions are made for warranties and returns 
management uses significant judgment in estimating warranty and sales return costs  considering numerous factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions and historical sales return and warranty rates 
although the company considers its warranty and sales return reserves to be adequate and proper  changes in historical customer patterns could require adjustments to the reserves 
historically  however  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
the company also records reductions to its revenues for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
disclosure concerning forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results in december  the private securities litigation reform act of the act was enacted by the united states congress 
the act  as amended  contains certain amendments to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these amendments provide protection from liability in private lawsuits for forward looking statements made by public companies 
the company takes advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 

table of contents the company s annual report on form k  including the letter of the chairman and chief executive officer included in the annual report to stockholders contains both historical information and other information that may be used to infer future performance 
examples of historical information include the company s annual financial statements and the commentary on past performance contained in the md a 
while the company has specifically identified certain information as being forward looking in the context of its presentation  the company cautions the reader that  with the exception of information that is clearly historical  all the information contained in this annual report on form k and the letter of the chairman and chief executive officer included in the report to stockholders should be considered to be forward looking statements as referred to in the act 
without limitation  when it uses the words believe  estimate  plan  expect  intend  anticipate  continue  project  probably  should  and similar expressions  the company intends to clearly express that the information deals with possible future events and is forward looking in nature 
forward looking information involves risks and uncertainties 
this information is based on various factors and assumptions about future events that may or may not actually come true 
as a result  the company s operations and financial results in the future could differ substantially from those the company has discussed in the forward looking statements in this annual report and other documents that have been filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in particular  various economic and competitive factors  including those discussed below could cause the company s actual results in future years to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing factors 
the following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect results 
covenants of senior secured credit facilities the senior secured credit facilities contain various provisions that limit our management s discretion by restricting its ability to  among other things incur additional debt or enter into sale and lease back transactions  pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock  issue preferred stock of subsidiaries  make certain investments  create liens to secure debt  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with another company  and transfer and sell assets 
in addition  the senior secured credit facilities require the company to meet specified financial ratios and tests 
these restrictions could limit the company s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities 
if the company were to fail to comply with the covenants and restrictions of the senior secured credit facilities  senior notes or any other subsequent financing agreements  a default could occur 
such a default could allow the lenders  if the agreements so provide  to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
in addition  the lenders could terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds 

table of contents substantial indebtedness the company is highly leveraged 
the company s high level of indebtedness could further interfere with its ability to operate its business 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors 
the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay the principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness is uncertain 
in particular  the company may not meet its anticipated revenue and operating expense targets  and as a result  its future debt service obligations could exceed the cash available to it 
significant customers the company has certain customers that are very important to its business and the successful implementation of its business strategy 
some of the company s products are sold in very competitive markets 
competitors may adopt more aggressive policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than the company  which could result in a loss of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
prices of raw materials or finished goods the company purchases most of the raw materials for its products on the open market  and relies on third parties for the sourcing of certain finished goods 
as such  cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials or sourced finished goods 
the company does not generally engage in commodity hedging transactions for raw materials 
significant increases in the prices of the company s products due to increases in the cost of raw materials or sourcing could have a negative effect on demand for its respective end products  or to the extent the company cannot pass such increases on to its customers  on its margins and profitability  as well as a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity the interest rate relating to the company s restructured facilities is based on a spread over libor 
the restructured facilities represent a considerable portion of the company s debt  and a significant change in the libor rate could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently the company is not utilizing any interest rate protection agreements to limit its exposure to this risk 
international operations the company has significant operations outside the united states 
also  certain of its domestic businesses generate significant revenue from export sales and certain businesses obtain a significant amount of finished goods from unaffiliated suppliers in east asia 
the company s international operations subject it to risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  unstable political and economic conditions  imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments of foreign subsidiaries  hyperinflation in 
table of contents certain foreign countries and imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 
no assurance can be given that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product mix historically  the company s businesses have sold a wide range of products 
if the mix of products it sells shifts to include a larger percentage of products with lower profit margins  earnings may be negatively affected 
environmental regulation the company s past and present business operations and its past and present ownership and operation of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposal of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to health  safety and protection of the environment 
as such  the nature of its operations and previous operations by others at real property owned by the company expose it to the risk of claims under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims 
based on the company s experience to date  it does not expect such claims or the costs of compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to have a material impact on its capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
no assurance can be given  however  that the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions  changes in environmental  health and safety laws and regulations or their interpretation  or other unanticipated events will not give rise to expenditures or liabilities that may have such an effect 
seasonality the company s business segments experience seasonal business swings  which correspond to the north american seasons 
this seasonality requires the company to manage its cash flows over the course of the year 
if sales were to fall substantially below what the company would normally expect during certain periods  its annual financial results would be adversely impacted and its ability to service debt may also be adversely affected 
weather weather could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and our results of operation 
adverse weather  such as unusually prolonged periods of cold or rain  blizzards  hurricanes and other severe weather patterns  could delay or halt construction activity 
for example  an unusually severe winter can lead to reduced construction activity and magnify the seasonal decline in the company s net sales and earnings during the winter months 
competition the markets in which the company sells its products are highly competitive 
the company competes against some international  national and many regional rivals  resulting in substantial pressure on our pricing and profit margins 
in addition  certain of the company s products from foreign manufacturers are subject to competition from other importers and could even be subject to competition from certain of the company s customers seeking to source directly from such foreign manufacturers 
as a result of pricing pressures  the company may in the future experience reductions in profit margins 
the company believes that its purchasing power  nationwide distribution network and marketing capabilities and its manufacturing efficiency allow it to competitively price its products 
the company cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain or increase the current market share of its products successfully in the future 

table of contents demand for products many individuals who purchase the company s products depend on financing either by independent consumer finance companies or  to a lesser extent  by independent distributors in order to make purchases 
fluctuations in the prevailing interest rates could affect the availability of financing to the company s customers 
the unavailability of consumer credit could lead to a reduction in demand for the company s products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  demand in the building and home improvement product industries is influenced by new construction activity and the demand for replacement products as well as repairs remodeling activity 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain a balanced mix of new and repair remodel revenue within the bath plumbing segment 
accordingly  the strength of the us economy including confidence in the us economy by our customers  the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets  institutional building activity  the age of existing housing stock  job growth and interest rates have a direct impact on the company 
threat or actual break out of hostilities and acts of war or terrorism involving the us could also negatively impact construction  repair or remodeling activity 
any declines in new housing or commercial construction starts or demand for replacement building and home improvement products may adversely impact the company and there can be no assurance that any such adverse effects would not be material and would not continue for an indeterminate period of time 
increase in size and market power of distributors the company believes that there is a trend among its distributors to increase in size and market power 
if this trend continues  they may be able to exert pressure on the company to reduce prices and create price competition 
any resulting price competition may adversely affect the company s sales and profit margins 
business strategy the company s ability to implement its business strategy successfully is dependent upon a number of factors including competition  availability of working capital and general economic conditions 
significant elements of the business strategy include growth of market share and introduction of related and new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement its strategy or be able to obtain financing for such strategy on acceptable terms 
the indentures governing the senior secured credit facilities and senior notes will substantially limit the company s ability to incur additional debt to finance its strategy 
in addition  the failure to implement the company s business strategy successfully may adversely affect its ability in the future to service its debt 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  the company is exposed to the risks associated with changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to limit the risks from such fluctuations  the company enters into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to the company s policies  but does not engage in such transactions for trading purposes 
to manage exposure to interest rate movements  the company has used interest rate protection agreements 
however  as of september   the company does not have any such agreements outstanding 
based on the company s overall exposure to interest rate changes  a hypothetical increase of basis points across all maturities of its floating rate debt obligations  would decrease the company s estimated pre tax earnings by approximately million in fiscal  compared to an approximate million decrease in fiscal pre tax earnings had libor rates been basis points higher 
net payments receipts under swap agreements amounted to approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the swaps were of notional amounts and maturities that related to specific portions of outstanding debt  and accordingly  were accounted for as hedge transactions 

table of contents the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its international operations as well as its us businesses  which import or export goods 
the company has made limited use of financial instruments to manage this risk 
effective october   the company adopted financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on its derivative and hedging activities
