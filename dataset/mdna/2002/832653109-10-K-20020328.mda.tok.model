item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk  assumptions  and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
words such as believe  may  could  expects  likely  variations of these words  and similar expressions  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in the section entitled factors that may affect future results  as well as those discussed in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general the trucking industry operated in a very difficult business environment in and a combination of high fuel prices  rising insurance premiums  a depressed used truck market  a declining number of owner operators  and slowing freight demand associated with an economic recession affected the profitability of most trucking companies  including smithway 
the company has historically expanded its operations through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth  but over the past three years the size of the company s business has decreased slightly 
from to  operating revenue decreased  to million in from million in for the year  smithway experienced a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share 
the loss included fourth quarter pre tax adjustments of million  including a  write off of the carrying value of proprietary operating software and a  adjustment to increase reserves for bad debts primarily as a result of steel company bankruptcies 
smithway s revenue was primarily impacted by a slowing economy  which reduced revenue per tractor per week and brokerage revenue versus the prior year 
in addition  higher fuel prices and insurance premiums and tighter credit standards by lending institutions caused the number of owner operators providing tractors to smithway to drop by approximately during with fewer owner operators  higher unseated company tractors  and lower production caused by soft freight demand  smithway s revenue base suffered 
in addition to industry pressures  the company s dry van operation significantly underperformed the flatbed operation 
freight and brokerage revenue decreased approximately million between and  and is projected to decrease million between and from customer bankruptcies 
management has sought  and will continue to seek  replacement freight  including freight from sectors other than steel and building materials 
on the expense side  smithway s profitability was affected primarily by higher insurance premiums  increased parts and maintenance expense  and the two previously mentioned non recurring adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  three of smithway s significant customers declared bankruptcy 
in  the company reserved  pre tax to reflect the full amount of the receivables owed by these customers plus certain amounts for other customers experiencing economic difficulties 
the  adjustment during the fourth quarter of was made because of additional steel company bankruptcies 
the adjustment is reflected in general and administrative expense 
the company operates a tractor trailer fleet comprised of both company owned vehicles and vehicles obtained under leases from independent contractors and third party finance companies 
fluctuations among expense categories may occur as a result of changes in the relative percentage of the fleet obtained through equipment that is owned versus equipment that is leased from independent contractors or financing sources 
costs associated with revenue equipment acquired under operating leases or through agreements with independent contractors are expensed as purchased transportation 
for these categories of equipment the company does not incur costs such as interest and depreciation as it might with owned equipment 
in addition  independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and certain other expenses are borne by the independent contractors and are not incurred by the company 
obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases reduces capital expenditures and on balance sheet leverage and effectively shifts expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses 
the fleet profile of acquired companies and the company s relative recruiting and retention success with company employed drivers and independent contractors will cause fluctuations from time to time in the percentage of the company s fleet that is owned versus obtained from independent contractors and under operating leases 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for the periods indicated operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation compensation and employee benefits fuel  supplies  and maintenance insurance and claims taxes and licenses general and administrative communication and utilities depreciation and amortization total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest expense  net earnings loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net earnings loss comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue decreased million  to million in from million in lower average revenue per tractor per week  decreased brokerage revenue  and decreased fuel surcharge revenue were responsible for the decrease in operating revenue 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations and fuel surcharges decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a higher number of unseated company tractors  lower weekly production caused by soft freight demand  and lower weekly production of tractors acquired from skipper transportation  inc in addition  soft freight demand caused a million decrease in brokerage revenue  to million in from million in finally  fuel surcharge revenue decreased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset company fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in revenue per loaded mile  net of surcharges  to in from in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation decreased million  to million in from million in  as the company contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in this reflects a decrease in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by independent contractors 
management believes the decline in independent contractor percentage is attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which have diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
compensation and employee benefits increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increases were primarily attributable to the increase in the percentage of the company s fleet represented by company owned equipment 
additionally  wages paid to drivers for unloaded miles increased during the year as weak freight demand caused deadhead miles to increase 
finally  workers compensation claims and premiums increased in compared with  and management expects this trend to continue in future periods 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased to of revenue in compared with in this was attributable primarily to i an increase in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by company owned equipment  ii a slightly older fleet of company owned equipment as the company has extended its trade cycle for tractors  and iii higher non billable miles for which the company incurs fuel expense  but does not recoup increased costs through fuel surcharges 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in fuel prices  which decreased to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in fuel surcharge revenue attributable to loads hauled by company trucks remained relatively constant at million in compared with million in the extension of the trade cycle for tractors is expected to continue to impact maintenance expense in future periods 
insurance and claims increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims increased to of revenue in compared with in the increase was attributable to a substantial increase in insurance premiums on july   when the company s insurance policies were renewed 
additionally  liability claims paid and reserved increased 
high premiums and claims are expected to continue to impact this category in future periods 
taxes and licenses decreased   to million in from million in  reflecting a decrease in the number of shipments requiring special permits 
the special permits are paid for by the shippers  which is included in freight revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained constant at of revenue in and general and administrative expenses remained essentially constant at million in and during the fourth quarter of  steel company bankruptcies caused the company to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts by  similarly  during the fourth quarter of  three major customers declared bankruptcy causing the company to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts by  general and administrative expenses  excluding bankruptcies  increased  in as the company incurred higher costs associated with recruiting and training new drivers 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in however  without the increases in allowance for doubtful accounts during and  general and administrative expenses would have increased to of revenue in compared with in communications and utilities remained essentially constant at million in and as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in depreciation and amortization decreased   to million in from million in in  the company committed to a plan to replace its proprietary computer operating system with third party software 
accordingly  the company wrote off the  carrying value of its existing software during the fourth quarter 
in and  the market value of used tractors declined in the united states 
in response  management assessed the valuation of its long lived assets and identified tractors with carrying values in excess of recoverable value 
the carrying value of these tractors was reduced by million in in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in and  the company recognized net gains on equipment  excluding one time write downs  of  and  respectively 
additionally  increasing costs of new equipment continued to increase depreciation per tractor 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization remained essentially constant at of revenue in and in interest expense  net  decreased million  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  decreased to of revenue in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pre tax margin decreased to in from in the company s income tax benefit was million  or of loss before income taxes 
the company s income tax benefit in was  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company 
the impact of the company s paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of the company s pre tax earnings 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss was million in of revenue  compared with net loss of million in of revenue 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million in from million in a substantial increase in fuel surcharge revenue to million in from  in was largely offset by lower revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations  and slightly lower weighted average tractors 
approximately million of the fuel surcharge revenue helped to offset company fuel costs and the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
revenue per tractor per week net of fuel surcharges decreased per week  to  in from  in  primarily caused by a 
decrease in average revenue per loaded mile 
weighted average tractors decreased  to  in from  during as the company s owner operator fleet decreased due to economic pressures that forced many to leave the trucking industry 
revenue from the company s brokerage operations increased   to million in from million in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation decreased million  to million in from million in  as the company contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in this reflects a decrease in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by independent contractors which was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of revenue paid to the independent contractors as they receive of fuel surcharges attributable to the loads they haul 
compensation and employee benefits increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the per mile wage paid to flatbed drivers in october and an increase in the percentage of the company s revenue attributable to company owned equipment 
this was partially offset by a decrease in workers compensation and health insurance claims in compared with fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased dramatically to in from in caused primarily by higher fuel price 
average fuel prices increased to per gallon during from per gallon in this increase was partially offset by million of fuel surcharges attributable to loads hauled by company trucks and  in gains from fuel hedging transactions 
the company attempted to recover increases in fuel prices through fuel surcharges and higher rates  however  the costs were not fully offset through these measures 
the company s fuel hedging positions expired in june insurance and claims decreased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims decreased to of revenue in compared with in  reflecting a decrease in liability and physical damage claims paid and reserved 
taxes and licenses decreased   to million in from million in  reflecting a decrease in the number of shipments requiring special permits 
the special permits are paid for by the shippers  which is included in freight revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in general and administrative expenses increased   to million in from million in  caused by an increase in bad debt expense 
during the fourth quarter of  three major customers declared bankruptcy causing the company to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts by  other general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenue in compared with of revenue in without the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts  general and administrative expenses would have remained constant at approximately of revenue in each year 
communications and utilities decreased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in depreciation and amortization increased million  to million in from million in in  the market value of used tractors declined in the united states 
in response  management assessed the valuation of its long lived assets and identified tractors with carrying values in excess of recoverable value 
the carrying value of these tractors was reduced by million 
in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in  the company recognized net losses on equipment of  adjusting for the million write down of equipment  compared to net gain of  in  causing a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
additionally  increasing costs of new equipment continued to increase depreciation per tractor 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in from in  reflecting losses on equipment  higher cost of new equipment  and lower revenue per tractor that less efficiently spread this fixed cost 
interest expense  net  increased   to million in from million in this increase was attributable to higher interest rates  offset partially by lower average debt outstanding 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  increased slightly to of revenue in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pre tax margin decreased to in from in the company s income tax benefit for was  or of loss before income taxes 
the company s income tax expense for was million  or of earnings before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company 
the impact of the company s paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of the company s pre tax earnings 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss was million in of revenue  compared with net earnings of million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources the size of the company s business has remained essentially constant for the past three years 
during this period the company has reduced debt and invested in new revenue equipment to replace older equipment 
new equipment has been financed in recent years with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  and equipment leases from third party lessors 
the company also has obtained a portion of its revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity currently are funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
the company reduced its borrowing by million during as cash generated from operations paid down long term debt 
the company has experienced a recent decrease in the ratio of its current assets to current liabilities  primarily as a result of a decrease in trade receivables and an increase in current maturities of long term debt 
the increase in current maturities resulted from a restructuring of the company s financing agreement with lasalle bank 
management expects this trend to continue in future periods until the company returns to profitability 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its currently anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other needs at least through net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and to internally finance acquisitions of revenue equipment 
total receivables increased decreased million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average age of the company s trade accounts receivable was approximately days for  days for  and days for net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such amounts related primarily to purchases  sales  and trades of revenue equipment and payments made for the acquisition of skipper transportation  inc in the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment and satellite communications units  net of revenue equipment trade ins  to be approximately million during such projected capital expenditures are expected to be funded with cash flow from operations  borrowings  or operating leases 
net cash used in financing activities of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted primarily of net payments of principal under the company s long term debt agreements 
on december   the company amended and restated its financing agreement with lasalle bank 
the new agreement expires on december   and provides for automatic one year renewals under certain conditions 
the agreement provides for a term loan  a revolving line of credit  and a capital expenditure loan 
the term loan has a balance of million  and is payable in equal monthly installments of  in principal 
the revolving line of credit allows for borrowings up to percent of eligible receivables 
the capital expenditure loan allows for borrowing up to percent of the purchase price of revenue equipment purchased with such advances provided borrowings under the capital expenditure loan are limited to million annually  and million over the term of the agreement 
the combination of all loans with lasalle bank can not exceed million 
at december   the company s borrowing limit was million  including the letters of credit discussed below  and total borrowings under the revolving line were  the financing agreement also includes financing for letters of credit 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million for self insured amounts under its insurance programs 
these letters of credit directly reduce the amount of potential borrowings available under the financing agreement discussed above 
all borrowings under this financing arrangement bear interest at the bank s prime rate  and the company is required to pay a facility fee on the financing agreement of 
of the maximum loan limit million 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by liens on revenue equipment  accounts receivable  and certain other assets 
the financing arrangement also requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including compliance with a minimum tangible net worth  capital expenditure limits  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  principal payments due by year in thousands less than after contractual obligations total one year years years years long term debt      operating leases purchase and installation of new software system total contractual cash obligations      the company had no other commercial commitments at december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the financial statements attached hereto 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions on which specific amounts were determined 
the company s critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition the company generally recognizes operating revenue when the freight to be transported has been loaded 
the company operates primarily in the short to medium length haul category of the trucking industry  therefore  the company s typical customer delivery is completed one day after pickup 
accordingly  this method of revenue recognition is not materially different from recognizing revenue based on completion of delivery 
the company recognizes operating revenue when the freight is delivered for longer haul loads where delivery is completed more than one day after pickup 
amounts payable to independent contractors for purchased transportation  to company drivers for wages  and other direct expenses are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided by use of the straight line and declining balance methods over lives of to years for buildings and improvements  to years for tractors and trailers  and to years for other equipment 
tires purchased as part of revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the equipment 
replacement tires are expensed when placed in service 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are charged to operations  and expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation on property and equipment retired  traded  or sold are eliminated from the property accounts at the time of retirement  trade  or sale 
in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement or sale is included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operation 
gains or losses on trade ins are included in the basis of the new asset 
estimated liability for insurance claims losses resulting from personal liability  physical damage  workers compensation  and cargo loss and damage are covered by insurance subject to certain deductibles 
losses resulting from uninsured claims are recognized when such losses are known and can be estimated 
the company estimates and accrues a liability for its share of ultimate settlements using all available information 
the company accrues for health insurance claims reported  as well as for claims incurred but not reported  based upon the company s past experience 
expenses depend on actual loss experience and changes in estimates of settlement amounts for open claims which haven not been fully resolved 
however  final settlement of these claims could differ materially from the amounts the company has accrued at year end 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  will be effective for the company for the year beginning january  under sfas  which establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets  all goodwill amortization will cease effective january  the company has tested for impairment of its goodwill by comparing the fair value of the company to its carrying value 
fair value was based upon an independent appraisal 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas and at least annually thereafter 
on an ongoing basis absent any impairment indicators  the company expects to perform the impairment tests during the fourth quarter 
initial impairment tests indicated no impairment of goodwill 
in  financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in  as required 
management has not yet determined what impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
related party transactions during the years ended december    and  there were no material transactions with related parties 
inflation and fuel costs most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  the compensation paid to drivers  and fuel prices 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company attempts to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could adversely affect profitability 
high fuel prices also decrease the company s profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company attempts to pass through increases in fuel prices to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  the fuel price increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality in the trucking industry results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and the company experiences some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of its trailers 
the company at times has experienced delays in meeting its shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
factors that may affect future results the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following general economic and business factors 
the company s business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges 
the company s results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries in which the company has a concentration of customers 
in addition  the company s results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments during the winter months 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
the company depends on cash from operations  operating leases  and debt financing for funds to maintain modern revenue equipment 
the company has slowed its growth and extended its trade cycle on tractors and trailers to limit capital expenditures 
if the company s operating results do not improve  and the company is unable in the future to enter into acceptable financing arrangements  it might be required to operate its revenue equipment for longer periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the failure of the company to maintain compliance with all covenants in its borrowing obligations  or obtain a waiver thereof  could have a significant impact on the company s liquidity and operating results 
resale of used revenue equipment 
in years prior to  the company frequently recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used equipment weakened dramatically since late if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to remain low or decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at a lower gain or a loss  or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
the company has suffered from an excessive number of company owned tractors without drivers for the past several quarters 
in addition  independent contractors have decreased industry wide for a variety of economic reasons 
the company s shortage of drivers and independent contractors has constrained revenue production 
failure to recruit additional drivers and independent contractors could force the company to increase compensation or limit fleet size  either of which could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and rail intermodal service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates 
acquisitions 
a significant portion of the company s growth prior to occurred through acquisitions 
in march  the company acquired the assets of skipper transportation  inc  a small flatbed carrier headquartered in birmingham  alabama 
this is the only acquisition the company has made during the past three years 
van division 
the company s van division has generated an operating loss for the past three years 
failure to turn around the operating losses may result in either continued operating losses or sale of the division at a time when the sale price of used equipment is depressed 
either result could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
operating losses 
the company has reported operating losses for the past two years 
failure to turn around the operating losses could result in violation of bank covenants  which could accelerate the company s debt and have a materially adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
continued operating losses also could impair the company s growth and ability to replace capital assets on the desired schedule  which could raise operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in i certain interest rates on its debt and ii certain commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company s financing agreement with lasalle bank  provided there has been no default  carries a variable interest rate based on lasalle s prime rate 
in addition  approximately million of the company s other debt carries variable interest rates 
this variable interest exposes the company to the risk that interest rates may rise 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one point increase in the prime rate would increase interest expense by approximately  the remainder of the company s other debt carries fixed interest rates and exposes the company to the risk that interest rates may fall 
at december   approximately of the company s debt carries a variable interest rate and the remainder is fixed 
commodity price risk the company in the past has used derivative instruments  including heating oil price swap agreements  to reduce a portion of its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
during the year ended december   the company had no such agreements in place 
the company does not trade in these derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  nor does it trade in these instruments when there are no underlying transaction related exposures
