consolidated cash and cash equivalents at june   includes approximately million of cash utilized in casino and route operations and held in vaults  cages or change banks 
pursuant to various state gaming regulations  we maintain restricted cash accounts to ensure availability of funds to pay wide area progressive jackpot awards  which totaled approximately million at june  in june  we completed a refinancing of our senior bank credit facility  which now consists of a million term loan  and a million revolving credit facility which can be increased by million at our discretion any time during the term of the agreement 
proceeds from the term loan were used to repay our existing bank term loans and credit facility  totaling million  repay certain gaming equipment operating leases totaling million  and to pay transaction fees and expenses

during the year ended june   cash flow from financing activities included million of cash provided from the exercise of stock options  offset by principal payments on other long term debt totaling million and million to pay capitalized bank fees 
customer financing management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become an increasingly important competitive factor for the bally gaming and systems and wall machine and amusement games business units 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while these financings are normally collateralized by such equipment  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the 
table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to the financial condition of our customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
bally wulff provides customer financing for approximately of our sales and also provides lease financing to our customers 
lease terms are generally for periods of six and twelve months  but are also available for terms up to months 
euro currency conversion our bally wulff subsidiary uses the euro as its functional currency

the conversion to the euro currency has now been completed  and the sale of euro denominated games and conversion kits had a positive impact on the current year

with the exception of the fixed million annual license fee owed for the use of the bally trademark  we have not scheduled out the royalty fees that may be owed in the future as they are dependent on the types of games to be sold in the future 
the payment obligations in the above table are based on the contractually scheduled due dates 
the only payment acceleration that could be demanded of us would generally be in the event of a default under the bank credit agreement or senior note indenture that was not cured within the provisions set forth in those agreements

set forth below is certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such looking forward statements 
high leverage  ability to service debt  liquidity as of june   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our long term indebtedness including current maturities was million 
we also have available up to million in unborrowed commitment under our revolving credit facility 
our credit facility and indenture contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests as defined or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries as defined  engage in mergers or consolidations  or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
in addition  the bank credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the bank credit facility 
in the event of any such default  the lenders under the new credit facility could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such borrowings or to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes  any of which would be an event of default under the senior subordinated notes

table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  our obligation to make principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness  and to comply with the covenants in the indenture and the agreements governing borrowings under the bank credit facility  will have several important effects on our future operations including the following i the portion of our cash flow from operations which will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness will not be available for other purposes  ii certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates  iii we may be more vulnerable to downturns in our business or in the general economy and may be restricted from making acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  and iv our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired

competition bally gaming and systems 
the market for gaming machines is extremely competitive  and there are a number of established  well financed and well known companies producing machines that compete with each of bally gaming and systems product lines in each of bally gaming and systems markets 
the domestic market for gaming machines is dominated by a single competitor  international game technology igt  with a number of smaller competitors in the field 
in addition  certain technology oriented companies have recently entered or may enter the gaming machine market 
management believes that some of these competitors have greater capital resources than we do 
competition among gaming machine manufacturers  particularly with respect to sales of gaming machines to new and emerging markets  is based on competitive customer pricing and financing terms  appeal to the player  product quality  and having an extensive distribution and sales network 
sales to established casinos in nevada normally require completion of a successful trial period for the machines in the casino 
the competition for the computerized monitoring systems currently consists of igt  aristocrat and  to a lesser extent  acres gaming  inc  gaming systems international  inc  and mikohn gaming corporation 
competition is keen in this market due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and the jurisdictions in which they operate 
pricing  product feature and function  accuracy  and reliability are all main factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
bally gaming and systems believes the future success of our operations will be determined by our ability to bring new and innovative products to the marketplace while at the same time maintaining the base of loyal existing customers 
wall machines and amusements games 
germany s wall machine manufacturing industry is dominated by bally wulff and two of our competitors 
management believes these three entities collectively account for more than of the entire market for wall machines  which exists almost exclusively in germany 
bally wulff s two major competitors own and operate a significant number of arcades  which gives them a competitive advantage arising from a built in market for their games and the ability to test market new games in their own arcades 
in addition  wall machines compete for floor space in arcades with non payout entertainment machines  which have gathered an increasing amount of the space in arcades 
these machines are not subject to the strict german licensing requirements governing wall machines 
bally wulff has not fully participated in the non payout entertainment machine market 
the wall machine industry is subject to a number of regulations  which are currently being reviewed by the german legislature 
the outcome of this review and whether it will be favorable or unfavorable to bally wulff cannot be predicted at this time 
the potential for changes in these regulations is currently having a negative demand on the market 

table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  route operations 
the competition for obtaining and renewing route contracts in nevada is high and continues to intensify 
such competition has  over time  reduced our gross profit margins for such operations 
in addition  such competition has required us to provide financial incentives to retain or obtain certain route locations 
such incentives include long term lease commitments  guarantees of leases in favor of owners of local establishments  substantial promotional allowances and advance deposits  payments of lease rentals in advance  payment of one time fees for the right to operate gaming locations and loans for buildings and tenant improvement costs 
notwithstanding our business strategy of emphasizing profitability rather than market share  the future success of our route operations will continue to be dependent to some extent on our ability and willingness to provide such financial inducements 
although we have historically generated sufficient new route contracts to offset the loss of old route contracts  due to increased competition  the increased sophistication and bargaining power of customers and possibly other factors not yet known  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new route contracts or renew or extend our route contracts upon their expiration or termination  or that  if renewed or extended  the terms will be as favorable to us 
in louisiana  our route operations at the racetrack and otbs compete with various truck stops and locations with liquor licenses throughout the new orleans area  as well as riverboat gaming and one land based casino 
casino operations 
the operation of casinos is also a highly competitive business 
the principal competitive factors in the industry include the quality and location of the facility  the nature and quality of the amenities and customer services offered and the implementation and success of marketing programs 
in sparks  nevada  the principal competition for our operations comes from larger casinos focusing on the local market 
our rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving the vicksburg market 
competition from casinos in nearby locations may also be reducing the market from which vicksburg casinos draw most of their patrons 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg and sparks  some of these sites may be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  might enjoy a competitive advantage over our casinos 
product development our future success depends to a large extent upon our ability to design  manufacture and market technologically sophisticated and entertaining products that achieve high levels of player acceptance 
the development of a successful new product or product design by a competitor could adversely affect sales of our products and force us to attempt to respond quickly with our own competing products 
response speed is lower in jurisdictions requiring product approvals prior to commercialization 
our plan with respect to the introduction of more sophisticated technology into the electronic gaming machine market is designed to lead to an increase in market share and profitability for us 
however  there is no assurance that any such products will be developed  or that if developed they will receive necessary regulatory approvals or be commercially successful 
although we are developing a number of new products  there can be no guarantee of commercial acceptance of any of our products 
the gaming industry is employing new technology in many new areas  and we and our competitors continue to file for patents protecting such technologies 
although we are not aware of any patent violations  there can be no assurances that patents currently pending may be determined to have infringed upon an existing patent held by a third party 
bally gaming and systems continues to deploy new products that are placed in casinos and earn recurring revenues and cash flows 
the amount of revenues earned is dependent on the earning power of the game 
the games will likely have a shorter life than more traditional games  and we will have to continue to design and deploy successful games to maintain this stream of revenue 
there can be no assurance that the games recently deployed will be successful or that we will be able to design and deploy new recurring revenue games 
sales to non traditional gaming markets the continued growth of the non traditional markets outside of nevada and atlantic city for electronic gaming machines is contingent on the public s acceptance of these markets and an ongoing regulatory approval process by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict which new jurisdictions or markets  if any  will approve the operation of electronic gaming machines  the timing of any such approval or the level of our 
table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  participation in any such markets  or whether jurisdictions currently permitting gaming will continue to do so in the future 
management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become increasingly important competitive factors for the bally gaming and systems and wall machine and amusement games business units 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while such equipment normally collateralizes these financings  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to the financial condition of our customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
bally wulff provides customer financing for approximately of our sales and also provides lease financing to our customers 
lease terms are generally for six months  but are also available for terms up to months 
foreign operations our business in foreign markets is subject to the risks customarily associated with such activities 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  expropriation  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
as of june   bally gaming and systems has million of receivables from countries outside of the united states most of which are denominated in us dollars 
we do not generally enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
dependence on key personnel our success will be dependent  to a significant extent  on the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of such executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations 
strict regulation by gaming authorities the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines and the conduct of gaming operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local  and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities each  a gaming authority 
although the laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate vary in their technical requirements and are subject to amendment from time to time  virtually all these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of the qualification  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval for companies engaged in gaming operations and the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines as well as for the officers  directors  major stockholders  and key personnel of such companies 
the company and our key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary for the manufacture and distribution  and operation where permitted  of its gaming machines in the jurisdictions in which it currently does business 
however  there can be no assurance those licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits  or approvals will be given or renewed in the future or that we will obtain the licenses necessary to operate in emerging markets 
our business is dependent on regulatory requirements 
for example  recurring demand exists for bally wulff s products because german regulations limit the permissible use of wall machines to a period of four years 
a change in applicable regulations could adversely affect the market for our products and services 
we currently have an agreement with fair grounds corporation  jefferson downs corporation  and finish line management corporation to be the exclusive operator of video poker machines at the only racetrack and ten associated otbs in the greater new orleans area 
on november   voters in louisiana approved a proposition to eliminate video poker in one of the seven parishes in which we operate gaming machines in otbs in the greater new orleans area 
these operations also depend on the financial viability of the racetrack and the otbs  which is beyond our control

gaming taxes and value added taxes gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to corporate and state income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
any material increase in these taxes or fees  which could occur prospectively or retroactively  would adversely affect us 
sales of bally wulff s products in germany are generally subject to value added taxes vat 
german tax authorities perform quadrennial audits of corporate tax returns 
during fiscal  bally wulff reached an agreement with the tax authorities on issues for the open tax years to bally wulff made a million payment for taxes  interest and penalties for those years 
we pay and expect to continue to pay substantial taxes and fees in nevada  louisiana and mississippi and expect to pay substantial taxes and fees in any other jurisdiction in which we conduct gaming operations

change of control upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined  each holder of the senior subordinated notes may require us to repurchase the senior subordinated notes held by such holder at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
the bank credit facility prohibits us from purchasing any senior subordinated notes  and provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect to the company would constitute a default thereunder 
in the event of a change of control  we must offer to repay all borrowings under the bank credit facility or obtain the consent of our lenders under the credit agreement to the purchase of senior subordinated notes 
if we do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings  we will remain prohibited from purchasing senior subordinated notes 
in such case  our failure to repurchase tendered senior subordinated notes would constitute a default under the indenture  which  in turn  would constitute a default under the credit facility 
there can be no assurance that we will have the financial ability to purchase the senior subordinated notes on the occurrence of a change of control 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of our obligations under the new credit facility  the indenture  and our other indebtedness on the occurrence of a change of control 
currency rate fluctuations we derive revenues from our non us subsidiaries  all of which revenues are denominated in their local currencies  and their results are affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies and the non us dollar 
most of the currencies in countries in which we have foreign operations strengthened versus the us dollar in and  which resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars 
we do not currently utilize hedging instruments 
market risks during the normal course of our business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest and currency rate movements  collectibility of accounts and notes receivable  and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
we constantly assess these risks and have established policies and practices designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis of our financial instruments  which consist of our cash and cash equivalents and debt 
we have no derivative financial instruments 
in performing the sensitivity analysis  we define risk of loss as the hypothetical impact on earnings  of changes in the market interest rates or currency exchange rates 

table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  the results of the sensitivity analysis at june   are as follows interest rate risk we had total debt as of june   of million  of which million are term loans with interest rates tied to libor 
these term loans are broken into individual loans with varying terms from one to six months 
the interest rate for each loan is set on the borrowing date and is effective for the term outstanding 
if the libor rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  with all other factors remaining constant  earnings would decrease or increase by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our german subsidiaries currently utilize the euro dollars as our functional currency 
prior to january  the german deutschemark was used 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate against the us dollar  would result in a corresponding change in earnings reported in the consolidated group  of approximately million 
such a change in the german euro dollar would result in a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of stockholder s equity  of approximately million  all other factors remaining constant 
estimates our financial statements are prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates either favorably or unfavorably  which may impact future results
