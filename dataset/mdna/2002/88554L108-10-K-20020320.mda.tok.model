we caution that these statements are qualified by various factors that may affect future results  including the special considerations in item 
table of contents overview we offer advanced design and manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers  commonly referred to as oems 
we specialize in custom display modules utilizing liquid crystal display  or lcd  components and technology 
our lcd modules have varying levels of integration 
at a minimum  each module includes an lcd  a custom lcd driver  and a flexible connector 
we also provide value added services  which increase our competitiveness  by assembling additional components onto the module based upon the specific needs of the customer 
these additional components may include such items as keypads  microphones  speakers  light guides  and optics 
we currently sell substantially all of our lcd modules to major oems 
we derived more than of our net sales in   and from the mobile handset market 
when we win a design program  our customers sometimes pay all or a portion of our nonrecurring engineering expenses to defray the costs of custom design  as well as all or a portion of the costs of nonrecurring tooling for custom components 
the typical design program life cycle of a custom designed lcd module is three to fifteen months and includes technical design  prototyping  pilot manufacturing  and high volume manufacturing 
in  our strategy was to seek large volume programs from major oems 
in that situation  the minimum production quantity for an lcd module typically approximates  units per year  although the production rate for some programs has been higher than  units per week 
recently  we have re focused our strategy on lower volume programs with potentially higher gross margins 
we have re focused our strategy because some oems with high volume programs have begun to expect to purchase lcd modules for less than industry costs 
the selling price of our lcd modules usually ranges between and per unit 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
generally  all of these conditions are met at the time we ship products to customers 
we experienced substantial growth from through  primarily as a result of sales to oems in the wireless communications industry  which grew substantially during that period 
during that period  our primary customer was motorola 
in  our net sales declined  primarily as a result of the phase out by motorola of a significant family of programs 
in  our net sales returned to pre levels primarily as a result of several new programs and customers 
we experienced substantial growth again in and  but due to the world wide economic slowdown in  our sales substantially declined 
motorola and its subcontractors accounted for of our net sales in  in  in  in  and in during the past several years  we have experienced seasonal quarterly fluctuations in our net sales as our oem customers developed retail products with shorter product life cycles and phased out older programs early in the year following holiday sales 
as a result  sales usually peak in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and are lower in the following quarter 
this pattern did not occur in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as a result of supply interruptions in the fourth quarter and reduced expectations in the mobile handset market  but this pattern is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of several factors impact our gross margins  including manufacturing efficiencies  product mix  product differentiation  product uniqueness  inventory management  and volume pricing 
in addition  significant pricing pressure exists in the lcd module market 
accordingly  those factors have impacted  and will continue to impact  our overall margins 
we vertically integrate our manufacturing facilities 
we generally have used our own high volume lcd production line for the manufacture of more technologically complex and custom high volume lcds 
we also purchased lcds from third party sources to provide us an alternate source and to ensure available capacity 
in order to take advantage of lower labor costs  we have traditionally shipped lcds to our facilities in manila  the philippines  or beijing  china  for assembly into modules 
during the second quarter of  we announced our strategic decision to move our front end  high volume lcd line from arizona to asia 
the lcd line was operated in arizona through the third quarter of  but the line is now shut down and in transit to asia 
we expect it will take two to three quarters to re install the line in asia 
we expect to incur no interruption in our lcd module production  as we will rely on built inventory stock and third party sources during the period that the line is being moved 

table of contents in manila  we assemble lcds into modules and perform certain back end lcd processing operations 
our back end lcd processing operations have been and will continue to be conducted in manila through a third party subcontract manufacturer through april after april  the manila back end lcd processing will be performed in our facility 
the subcontractor supplies direct labor and incidental services required to manufacture our products 
all indirect manufacturing employees  primarily technicians  supervisors  and engineers  are our employees 
our lcd module operations are conducted at our own factory  where we employ our own employees and do not employ the services of a third party subcontractor 
in beijing  we also assemble lcds into modules 
our lcd module operations in beijing are conducted at a facility we own through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
we employ our own employees in beijing 
selling  general  and administrative expense consists principally of administrative and selling costs  salaries  commissions  and benefits to personnel and related facility costs 
we make substantially all of our sales directly to oems  and our sales force consists of a small number of direct technical sales persons 
as a result  there is no material cost of distribution in our selling  general  and administrative expense 
in addition  we have recently incurred substantial marketing and administrative expenses in connection with our lcos microdisplay business 
research  development  and engineering expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists  design engineers  and other technical personnel  related facility costs  process development costs  and various expenses for projects  including new product development 
research  development  and engineering expense continues to increase as we develop new display products and technologies  especially lcos microdisplays 
since  we have been working on the development of lcos microdisplays 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance with national semiconductor corporation for the development of lcos microdisplay products 
under that alliance  national focused on the silicon technologies needed for microdisplays  and we focused on the liquid crystal technologies 
in  national decided to close its microdisplay business unit 
in connection with that closing  in july  we purchased certain assets and licensed silicon technologies from national relating to lcos microdisplays 
we paid approximately million in cash and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the transaction  which valued the transaction at approximately million 
no additional payments are required under the licenses 
we also hired several key technical employees of national to assist in the implementation of the acquired technologies 
in april  we entered into a strategic relationship with inviso  inc  a privately held company with numerous patents and proprietary technology related to microdisplay development 
we acquired a minority equity interest in inviso for approximately million 
in march  we acquired an additional interest in inviso for  raising our total minority equity interest to million 
as part of this strategic relationship  we provided proprietary manufacturing capabilities and liquid crystal expertise  and inviso provided patented and proprietary technologies and components for the joint development of microdisplay products 
in the second quarter of  we wrote off our investment of million in inviso because we determined that our investment was impaired  as that term is defined under generally accepted accounting principles 
subsequent to our write off  inviso was unable to raise funds to operate its business and has since ceased operations 
in august  our wholly owned subsidiary  three five systems beijing co  ltd  entered into a strategic agreement with heibei jiya electronics  co  ltd 
jiya  a chinese based manufacturer of lcd glass 
under the terms of the agreement  jiya agreed to provide lcd glass to us and reserve a significant amount of lcd glass manufacturing capacity for us 
in exchange  we agreed to assist jiya in further developing its lcd glass manufacturing processes 
at the conclusion in february  we had the option to extend the agreement or to acquire a majority interest in jiya 
we elected not to extend the agreement or acquire a majority interest 
in  we invested million in silicon bandwidth  inc  a privately held company providing unique semiconductor and optoelectronic interconnect solutions based upon multiple  patented  proprietary technologies 
we are working closely with silicon bandwidth to design unique  cost effective  reconfigurable packaging platforms for lcos microdisplays 
during the second quarter of  we formed a new company  three d oled llc  with dupont displays  a business unit of dupont corporation 
we own of this new venture  and dupont displays owns 
the companies have pledged million to the venture 
our share of that obligation is slightly over 
table of contents million 
this new venture was formed to design  assemble  and market oled organic light emitting diode display modules to oems worldwide 
the venture focuses on glass substrate  passive matrix oled displays 
oled technology utilizes advanced materials to produce bright  high contrast  emissive displays 
the venture is headquartered in tempe  arizona  within our existing corporate headquarters  and is controlled by us 
the venture will utilize the glass panel output of a planned high volume manufacturing plant located in taiwan  announced by dupont and ritdisplay technology corporation 
the venture may also use other oled glass panel sources 
oled display modules will be assembled at our display module assembly facilities in beijing and manila 
in january  we purchased the intellectual property of zight corporation  a private company focused on microdisplays for personal display system applications 
in addition  we purchased certain key assets of zight at a creditor s auction and we hired six key technical persons formerly employed by zight 
the total cost of the acquisition was approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap of the united states of america 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists  that is  a product is shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables  considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with the temporary differences that have resulted from the differing treatment of items dictated by generally accepted accounting principles versus us tax laws 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we were to believe that the recovery were not more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset and charge the amount as an income tax expense in the period in which such a determination were made 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development  and engineering operating income loss other income  net minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in although some of the decrease was attributable to the reduced volume of unit shipments  the revenue decrease was primarily the result of decreased selling prices of lcd modules due to excess worldwide lcd capacity 
we shipped million units in versus million units in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to of net sales in from in this percentage increase resulted primarily from reduced selling prices and reduced operating efficiencies 
also contributing to the increased cost of sales was the sale of lcos microdisplay products at a loss 
we incurred a loss at the gross margin line for our lcos microdisplay sales primarily because of very low manufacturing yields 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expense was of net sales in compared to of net sales in this increase in percent was due to lower net sales in research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased to million in from million in research  development  and engineering expense was of net sales in compared to of net sales in research  development  and engineering expense overall increased as the result of the continued development of lcos microdisplays 
the selling  general  and administrative expense and the research  development  and engineering expense in each year included significant operating expenditures in lcos microdisplays at a time when there was very little lcos microdisplay revenue 
in  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses specifically related to lcos microdisplays compared to approximately million in other income expense  net 
other income in was million compared to other income of million in the primary difference was the write off of our million investment in inviso  inc interest earned in was million compared with million in provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in compared to a provision for income taxes of million in in recording the benefit  we used an effective tax rate of in compared to an effective tax rate of in the difference is primarily a change in relative operational results between us and foreign jurisdictions  and a benefit for research and development credits recorded during in  we expect to record a tax benefit against any operating losses we incur using an estimated rate of approximately 
the benefit for income taxes that we recorded has generated a million deferred tax asset at december  related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of which no valuation allowance has been recorded as management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be fully realized 

table of contents net income 
in  we recorded a net loss of million using generally accepted accounting principles  or per diluted share compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in we recorded several unusual expense items in the second quarter of  including the write off of our investment in inviso  inc  the write off of certain inventory  and the write off of an enterprise resource planning system implementation 
on an after tax basis  those unusual expenses totaled million  or per diluted share 
the direct view display segment recorded a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share in compared to net income of million  or earnings per share in the decline in revenue was related to intense pricing pressures for our modules and the worldwide economic slowdown in the microdisplay segment recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share in compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share in the increased loss was created by intensified rd e efforts to bring microdisplays to market 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in this increase was the result of several new programs  primarily for motorola 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to of net sales in from in this percentage decrease resulted primarily from increased operating efficiencies in the first half of and cost reduction efforts 
pricing pressures and under absorption issues resulting from decreased production levels in the second half of actually resulted in a sharp increase in the cost of sales in the second half of  especially in the fourth quarter 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expense was of net sales in compared to in the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expense was a result of our efforts to hold down costs 
research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased to million in from million in research  development  and engineering expense was of net sales in compared to in in general  research  development  and engineering expense overall increased as the result of the development of new display products and technologies  including lcos microdisplays 
expenses also increased in lcd engineering as a result of the increased number of design wins 
the selling  general  and administrative expense and the research  development  and engineering expense in each year included significant operating expenditures in lcos microdisplays at a time when there was very little lcos microdisplay revenue 
in  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses specifically related to lcos microdisplays compared to approximately million in other income expense  net 
other income in was million compared to other expense of  in we had sharply higher interest income and reduced interest expense in as the result of decreased debt and increased cash and investment balances 
those increased cash and investment balances were primarily as a result of our equity offering in may provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in compared to million in the effective tax rate was in compared to in this change resulted primarily from tax benefits in the third and fourth quarters of relating to research and development tax credits 
generally  the tax rate was also lower in as a result of higher net income in china  which is a low tax rate jurisdiction 
in  we expect our overall tax rate to be approximately 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in from million  or per diluted share  in the direct view display segment recorded net income of million  or earnings per share in compared to net income of million  or earnings per share in the microdisplay segment recorded a net loss of million  or loss per share in compared to a net loss of million  or loss per share in

net sales cost and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development  and engineering operating income loss other income expense  net minority interest in consolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss historically  we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our net sales 
oem customers that purchase our products for incorporation into retail products  such as mobile handsets  typically increase their purchases during the year end holiday period and phase out old programs early in the year following holiday sales 
as a result  net sales typically peak in the fourth quarter and reach a seasonal low point in the first quarter 
this pattern did not occur in as a result of supply interruptions in the fourth quarter of and reduced expectations in the mobile handset market 
the pattern is expected to resume for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of there is significant pricing pressure in higher volume programs in the wireless communications and office automation industries 
this pricing pressure accelerated in late and early as a result of the economic slowdown in 
table of contents as revenue declined in the second half of  absorption issues from the reduced manufacturing levels resulted in lowered margins 
in addition  pricing pressures in the mobile handset business also contributed to the reduced gross margins 
in  severe pricing pressures in lcd modules as a result of excess capacity in lcds resulted in substantially reduced selling prices and  as a result  in substantially reduced gross margins 
in and  we continued to expand and intensify our research and development efforts on proprietary display products  such as lcos microdisplays 
we had other expense in the second quarter of as a result of writing off our inviso investment 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short and long term liquid investments of million compared to million at december  in  we had million in net cash outflow from operations compared to million in net cash flow from operations in cash flow from operations during decreased as a result of lower revenue 
as of december   our inventory turns were and dsos day sales outstanding were days as compared with inventory turns and dsos as of december  our depreciation and amortization expense was million in and our working capital was million at december   down from million at december  our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  the decreases in our working capital and current ratio occurred primarily because of our net loss and cash used in operations 
in february  we renewed our credit facility with comerica bank 
that credit facility is a million unsecured revolving line of credit that matures in january no borrowings were outstanding under that credit facility on december  advances under the new facility may be made as prime rate advances  which accrue interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate  or as libor rate advances  which bear interest at basis points in excess of the libor base rate 
as of december   our beijing subsidiary had an outstanding million term loan due may  to the bank of china  which was secured by a million stand by letter of credit issued by comerica bank 
capital expenditures during were approximately million 
those capital expenditures consisted of million for equipment  leasehold improvements  intangibles  and license costs in manila  beijing  and arizona  and million for lcos microdisplays

the following tables list our contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts in thousands committed less than year years years over years term loan operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts in thousands committed less than year years years over years guarantee 
table of contents the operating leases include a lease for our factory in manila and our ground lease in tempe  arizona 
these are described in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the guarantee relates to our guarantee in connection with a small business administration loan given to voiceviewer technology  inc  a private company developing microdisplay products 
the million standby letter of credit issued by comerica has not been included in the other commercial commitments table because it only exists to secure the term loan obligation of million  which is already included in the table for contractual obligations 
we have no other long term debt  capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations or other long term obligations and we do not have any other commercial commitments 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments will provide adequate sources to fund our operations and planned expenditures through  as well as meet our contractual obligations 
specifically  we have million in cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term loan investments 
our capital expenditures in are expected to be around million  and we expect operating cash outflow to be minimal relative to our cash reserves 
we continue to seek other alliances or acquisitions and additional relationships with regard to the strategic development of various new technologies  especially lcos microdisplays  that may also require us to make additional capital investments 
in such a case  we may need to expand our loan commitments or pursue alternate methods of financing or raise capital 
we cannot provide assurance that adequate additional loan commitments or alternative methods of financing will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms acceptable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we hold no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
we have certain receivables denominated in chinese renminbi 
to eliminate our exposure to changes in the us dollar chinese renminbi exchange rate  we have entered into forward contracts to protect future cash flows 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we account for changes in the fair value of our forward contracts  based on changes in the forward exchange rate  with all changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income 
amounts in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings upon settlement of the forward contract 
as of december   we had four forward contracts outstanding with a cumulative notional value of million expiring through april primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have a revolving line of credit with a variable interest rate of libor at december  plus basis points 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
we generally sell our products and services and negotiate purchase orders with our foreign suppliers in us dollars 
however  we have certain foreign currency exchange exposure as a result of our manufacturing operations in the philippines and china and our sales and distribution facility in the united kingdom 
we have not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date 
some of the expenses of these foreign operations are denominated in the philippine peso  chinese renminbi  and british pound sterling  respectively 
these expenses include local salaries and wages  utilities  and some operating supplies 
as a result of these sales and expenses  we do have accounts receivable and cash deposits in local currencies 
we believe  however  that the operating expenses currently incurred in foreign currencies other than the chinese renminbi are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
although the chinese currency currently is stable  its value in relation to the us dollar is determined by the chinese government 
there is general speculation that china may devalue its currency 
devaluation of the chinese currency could result in translation adjustments to our balance sheet as well as reportable losses depending on our monetary balances and outstanding indebtedness at the time of devaluation 
the government of china historically has made it difficult to convert its local currency into foreign currencies 
although we from time to time may enter 
table of contents into hedging transactions in order to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  the chinese currency is not freely traded and thus is difficult to hedge 
in addition  the government of china has imposed restrictions on chinese currency loans to foreign operated entities in china 
based on the foregoing  we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse effect on our operations
