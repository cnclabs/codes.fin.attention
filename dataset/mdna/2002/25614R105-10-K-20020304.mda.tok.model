item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market and support a family of document automation software used in high volume electronic publishing applications 
we were incorporated in delaware in october as a wholly owned subsidiary of xerox corporation 
following our initial public offering of stock in september  xerox ownership was reduced to approximately 
as a result of our tender offer and our exercise of an option to purchase additional shares from xerox in april  xerox s ownership interest has been reduced to 
critical accounting policies we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition and sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
revenues generated from consulting services are recognized as the related services are performed 
however  when such consulting services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized on a percentage of completion method or not until the contract is completed in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and arb no 
 long term construction type contracts 
our operating expenses are primarily based on anticipated revenue levels 
since a high percentage of those expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and we may sustain losses as a result 
since revenue may not be recognized in the same quarter as when shipment occurs and if such fixed expenses precede these revenues  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
computer software costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product has been established 
after technological feasibility has been established  direct production costs  including programming and testing  are capitalized until general release of the product 
capitalized costs of software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed are amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current period product revenues to estimated total product revenues or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic lives of the products 
it is possible that estimated total product revenues  the estimated economic life of the product  or both  will be reduced in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of capitalized software costs may be reduced in the future  which could cause our operating results in future periods to be adversely affected 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues total revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to our revenues are divided into three categories based upon the sources from which they are derived initial license fees  annual renewal license and support fees  and services and other revenues 
initial license fees consist primarily of license fees for the first year of use of our products 
annual renewal license and support fees consist of license fees for the continued use and support of our licensed products 
services and other revenues consist of fees for consulting  application development and training services performed by us as well as miscellaneous other operational revenues 

table of contents we sell our products principally through our direct sales force domestically  and internationally through distributors and value added resellers vars 
revenues from export sales and sales through our foreign subsidiary were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to revenue from export sales were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was the result of lower initial license fees in all regions 
the increase from to was primarily the result of increased revenues through our xerox affiliates in australia and europe 
we have entered into distributorship agreements with various xerox foreign affiliates to remarket our products internationally 
our revenues from these agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was the result of lower initial license fees in all regions 
the increase from to was primarily the result of increased revenues through our xerox affiliates in australia and europe 
initial license fees 
initial license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to the decreases in and were largely the result of fewer sales and fewer new customers from our foreign resellers 
initial license revenues were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
annual renewal license and support fees 
annual renewal license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in was largely offset by the impact of discontinuing support for certain products and platforms 
these increases in license renewal and support fees were principally due to an increase in the installed base of users of our software products 
annual license fees were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
services and other 
revenues from services and other were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the increase in is due to the delivery of consulting services needed to implement new product sales made since the fourth quarter of as well as significant services to existing customers 
the decrease in was principally due to the mix of software sold  which only required minimal consulting services at implementation 
revenues from services and other were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of initial license fees 
costs of initial license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of initial license fees in  and  respectively 
cost of initial license fees includes documentation  reproduction costs  product packaging and media  employment costs for installation and distribution personnel  the cost of third party software and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs 
the decrease in compared to was due to lower sales and a decrease in the amortization of software 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of expensing the remainder of the capitalized software costs of vcpro due to the th quarter release of vcpro cost of annual renewal license and support fees 
costs of annual license fees were  million and million  and  respectively  representing  and of annual license fees in  and  respectively 
costs of annual renewal license fees consist principally of the employment related costs for our technical support staff 
the increase in compared to was due to additional technical support personnel necessary to support our increasing customer base 
the increase in compared to was due to the implementation of a new technical support database and additional technical support personnel necessary to support our increasing customer base 
cost of services and other 
costs of services and other were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of services and other revenue in 
table of contents and  respectively 
costs of services and other consist principally of the employment related costs of our consulting and training staff 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to additional personnel costs and the greater use of outside consultants to complete our increased consulting work in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to attrition and transferring underutilized personnel to other departments 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to research and development expenses consist primarily of the employment related costs of personnel associated with developing new products  enhancing existing products  testing software products and developing product documentation 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to direct significant resources to the development and enhancement of our products 
in connection with a development services and referral agreement effective january   we have signed a two year agreement with objectiva software solutions  inc to provide us development services  which could range up to million 
we capitalized software development costs of  million and  in  and  respectively 
some of the new products started in have yet to reach technological feasibility 
the amount of software development costs to be capitalized in the future may change if the time between the establishment of technological feasibility of a product and its general release changes 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing programs and related costs for pre and post sales activity 
the decrease in was primarily due to fewer personnel and decreased commissions due to decreased initial license fees 
the increase in was primarily due to increased marketing expenditures on advertising  promotion activities and trade shows 
selling and marketing expenses were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to general and administrative expenses consist of employment related costs for finance  administration and human resources  allowance for doubtful accounts and general corporate management expenses  including legal and audit fees 
the decrease in was primarily due to decreased personnel and outside consultant costs 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and higher professional fees 
general and administrative expenses were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
other income expense 
other income expense is composed of interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments offset by interest expense related to notes to xerox and losses on disposal of fixed assets 
other income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was the result of less interest income following a large decrease in our cash balances as a result of our tender offer which was completed in april the increase in was from higher cash balances which generated higher interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in and was for taxes under the alternative minimum tax 
effective tax rates were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
these rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the change in the valuation allowances offsetting deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect future operating results our total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for our products  the level of product and 
table of contents price competition  the length of our sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of our customers  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to develop and market new products  controlling costs and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  our sales generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenue per order  and  therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on our revenues and quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
our software products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the timing of receipt of initial license fees is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  typically three to twelve months from the initial contact 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of initial license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  revenues and operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this is a decrease of million from december   which was used primarily to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share pursuant to our tender offer 
on april   we executed two promissory notes payable to xerox to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock owned by xerox at per share 
the principal amount of the first note was  and accrued interest at 
this note was due on march  the principal amount of the second note was  and accrued interest at 
this note was due on march  both of these notes were paid in full on february  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the next twelve months 
a portion of our remaining cash could be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
we are currently evaluating  in our ordinary course of business  potential investments such as businesses  products or technologies 
we have no material current understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition in whole of other businesses  products or technologies 
as of december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

euro conversion in january  a new currency called the euro was introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
our subsidiary  document sciences europe  is based in one of these countries  france 
during  most emu countries converted to the euro as their single currency 
although the conversion has gone smoothly  we cannot assure you that there will not be any future material adverse effects on our financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies on non us based competitors 
the primary foreign currency risk exposure is related to us dollar to euro conversions 
considering both the anticipated cash flows from firm sales commitments and anticipated sales for the next quarter  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual export sales during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the affect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects described above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
each month we review our position for expected currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
