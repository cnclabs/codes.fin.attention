item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview atmi is a leading supplier of materials  equipment and related services used worldwide in the manufacture of semiconductor devices 
atmi specifically targets the front end semiconductor materials market 
this market includes the processes used to convert a bare silicon wafer into a fully functional wafer that contains many copies of a semiconductor device or chip 
atmi s customers include most of the leading semiconductor manufacturers in the world 
atmi has organized its operations along two business segments materials and technologies 
the materials segment provides products that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process and related packaging and delivery systems 
the technologies segment provides products and services that sense and environmentally control these materials while also providing specialized thin film deposition and outsourced parts cleaning and tool maintenance services to semiconductor device manufacturers 
the technologies segment also includes atmi s venture and government funded research and development activities 
the semiconductor industry and the semiconductor equipment industry in particular have been highly cyclical and have experienced periods of overcapacity at various times  resulting in significantly reduced demand for semiconductor materials  capital equipment and wafer processing services 
the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a severe downturn of unprecedented magnitude that has been ongoing for several quarters 
according to industry research  wafer starts in december were lower than peak production levels in november  and equipment orders in december were lower than peak levels in september atmi s operating results have been significantly impacted by the current downturn  especially with regard to our product lines that track industry capacity 
the decline in wafer starts throughout the industry stopped in the fourth quarter of  and in fact  while not significant  there has been slight incremental monthly improvement in wafer starts data during the fourth quarter of however  lack of visibility remains and the level of recovery in the near term is uncertain 
with regard to capital equipment spending  there remains substantial over capacity on a global basis 
currently  there appears to be some advanced technology equipment spending  but the prospects for significant capacity expansion is unlikely in the near term 
atmi has completed seven acquisitions during the three years ended december   six of which have been accounted for as pooling of interests 
as a result  the company s consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the results of these six acquired companies 
the acquisition of the minority interest of atmi s adcs korea joint venture was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of atmi s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires atmi to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities and investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring charges  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and services rendered and collectibility of those fees 
the company s revenues from product sales are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon shipment 
service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the period of the related contract  or if not under contract  when service is provided 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is recognized 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
should actual product failure rates differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
marketable securities and investments the company holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or related to its strategic focus  some of which are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are highly volatile and some of which are in private companies whose value is difficult to determine 
investments in private companies are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption goodwill and other long term assets  net 
atmi records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and other identifiable intangible assets  such as patents and trademarks and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
these assets are currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
restructuring during the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded significant charges in connection with restructuring initiatives 
these charges include estimates related to employee separation costs  plant closing costs  early lease termination expenses and various other asset and working capital write offs or write downs 
although management does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly 
likewise  in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made

revenues decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the overall downturn in the semiconductor industry  which affected both segments of atmi s business materials and technologies 
the materials segment experienced a revenue decline of  while technologies revenues declined from levels 
in  materials revenues were down significantly in certain liquid chemistry  gases  and delivery equipment product lines 
during  the technologies segment experienced steep revenue declines in the environmental treatment equipment product lines and in thin film deposition services product lines  with modest declines experienced in gas monitoring systems product lines and parts cleaning 
the increase in sales between and was driven by the growth in the semiconductor industry  as well as increased market penetration and new product introductions 
materials revenues increased in from levels  mainly as a result of increased market penetration of gas delivery systems  and volume gains in materials  liquid delivery systems and high purity packaging product lines 
technologies revenues increased in from levels  led by significant growth in thin film deposition services  the environmental and sensing product lines  and atmi s emosyn business 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to in compared to in excluding special charges of million related to inventory write downs  gross profit decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  gross profit  excluding the special charges  declined to in from in the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to steep volume declines in the environmental treatment equipment  thin film deposition services  and liquid chemistry and delivery equipment product lines 
in  gross profit increased to million from in gross margin decreased slightly to in from in the decrease was due in large part to factors within the technologies segment end of year softness in the environmental sensing and abatement equipment product lines  manufacturing inefficiencies in thin film deposition services due to the addition and continued ramp up of manufacturing capacity to support growth  and a higher percentage of total revenues generated by the emosyn business  which operates at lower margins than other atmi businesses and product lines 
partially offsetting these declines were favorable product mix shifts in the high purity packaging product lines  and materials and delivery systems in the materials segment 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased to in from in  driven primarily by the significant revenue decline in compared to despite the semiconductor industry downturn and weakened business performance in both the materials and technologies segments  atmi continued r d spending on targeted programs to ensure that we have the products our customers need for future generation chip manufacturing processes  with a particular emphasis on advanced interconnect production processes 
in  research and development expenses increased to million from million in the increase represented the company s continued efforts to develop advanced materials  including development efforts on the sds r and chemicals product lines  and continued development work in the sensing and abatement product lines 
additionally  the company continued to support development efforts in the emosyn and gan materials ventures 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development spending remained relatively flat at in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in  representing an increase of 
excluding a special charge of million for the write down of certain accounts receivable balances  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in due to the restructuring efforts undertaken in  selling  general and administrative costs in the fourth quarter of were significantly lower than in the beginning of the year 
therefore  the quarterly run rate for selling  general and administrative expenses is lower going into than it was in the first quarter of in  selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues  compared to in the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of the significant decline in revenues in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  these expenses declined to in from in the decrease  as a percentage of revenues  was due to decreased administrative costs resulting from continued cost savings initiatives tied to the integration activities of business acquisitions  and the decrease in executive compensation paid to members of management of certain acquired businesses 
offsetting the cost savings were increases in legal costs associated with defending and protecting the company s intellectual property  costs associated with implementation of an enterprise wide information system  and a full year of costs of operating the company s new asian sales and distribution facilities 
restructuring charge 
operating results for include a million charge for severance and other costs associated with restructuring initiatives announced by management during the first and third quarters of these charges include costs related to plant closings  lease termination fees  and various other assets and working capital write offs or write downs 
an additional million charge related to a write down of inventory in a product line no longer strategic to atmi is included in cost of revenues 
merger costs and related expenses 
the operating results include million of merger and related costs incurred in connection with professional fees and transaction costs related to the july esca acquisition 
the operating results included merger and related costs of million  including million of professional fees and transactions costs related to the november acquisitions of mst and newform and million of investment banking fees  legal fees and accounting fees in connection with the investigation  analysis and may closing of the telosense  delatech and acsi transactions 
the merger related costs also included a million reversal of previously accrued merger costs for prior acquisitions 
the acquisition of delatech also resulted in a million asset impairment charge during the second quarter of for inventory million and goodwill million associated with an existing environmental equipment product line which was determined to be impaired 
operating income loss 
for  the company generated an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million in operations  excluding the restructuring charges of million and special charges related to inventory and accounts receivables write downs of million and million  respectively  generated a loss of million in  compared to operating income of million  excluding merger and related costs of million in the decrease reflects the effects of the significant semiconductor industry downturn in and its effect on coverage of atmi s increased fixed cost base 
materials operating income decreased to million in compared to million in the technologies segment generated an operating loss of million in  compared to operating income of million in  representing a decrease of million 
both segments were severely impacted by reduced volumes in most product lines  which drove lower gross margins 
in  operating income  including the recognition of merger and related costs  increased almost four fold to million from million in as a percentage of revenues  operating income increased to in compared to in the revenue growth experienced in drove considerable operating income increases 
materials operating income increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by increased market penetration of gas delivery systems  volume gains in materials  liquid delivery systems and high purity packaging product lines  and improved leveraging of materials fixed overhead structure 
the significant revenue increase in combined with stronger margins and cost containment initiatives resulted in higher operating income within materials 
materials operating income  as a percentage of materials revenues  was and for and  respectively 
technologies operating income increased to million in  from million in the increase was driven by significant growth in thin film deposition services  the environmental and sensing product lines  and atmi s emosyn business  and increased operating leverage through a focus on overhead cost reduction in this segment 
investments in research and product development within emosyn and the company s other ventures are reflected in technologies operating income 
technologies operating income  as a percentage of technologies revenues  was and in and  respectively 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  decreased to million in from million in the results include the positive impact of a settlement of certain patent litigation  net of related expenses  and a million gain from the sale of available for sale securities  offset by a write down of approximately million for a decline in fair value of other available for sale securities 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  as a result of the lower average cash balances on hand and lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in  despite the higher debt balance due to atmi s fourth quarter convertible debt offering of million  mainly as a result of interest capitalization on capital construction projects 
in  interest and other income  net  increased to million from million in in  other income included a gain of approximately million on the sale of certain marketable equity securities by the company  offset by a write off of a million cost basis investment 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to proceeds received of approximately million related to the company s public stock offering in april and increased cash balances derived from improved operating results of the company 
income taxes 
in  the income tax benefit was million  compared to income tax expense of million in the decline was due to the company s operating losses as a result of the semiconductor industry downturn and the restructuring efforts undertaken by management during the effective tax rate for was  and differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily because of state and foreign income taxes  foreign sales corporation benefits  research and development credits  and reduced profitability 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in the effective tax rate was 
the effective tax rate was 
the decline in the effective rate in was based on the fact that there was a declining impact of acquired companies historic tax rates on restated financial statements in that year 
atmi incurred non deductible merger costs in and recognized benefits based on changes in estimates regarding the realizability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of certain acquired companies 
minority interest 
minority interest represented the interest held by kc tech co  ltd 
in the operations of adcs korea  which was a joint venture established to manufacture  sell and distribute chemicals to the semiconductor and related industries in south korea 
in the fourth quarter of  atmi purchased the interest in the operations of adcs korea from the former joint venture partner  which eliminated the minority shareholder s interest in earnings 
net income loss per share 
net loss per share assuming dilution was for  compared to earnings per share assuming dilution of for on a pro forma basis in  excluding restructuring charges  special charges  and one time gains due to a legal settlement and the sale of investments  the net loss was million or per diluted share  compared with pro forma net income of million or per diluted share  and million or per diluted share in  which excludes merger and related costs pursuant to acquisitions  certain severance costs related to reorganizing the businesses pursuant to these acquisitions  and one time gains associated with the sale of investments 
weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution was million for compared to million in the difference in weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution between and is primarily the result of excluding the effect of shares held in escrow and common stock equivalents due to the antidilutive effect of including those shares 
weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution increased to million shares for the year ended december   from million shares for the year ended december  the increase in primarily resulted from the completion of the april  public offering of million shares 
liquidity and capital resources years ended december    and to date  atmi has financed its activities principally through cash from operations  the sale of equity  the issuance of convertible debt securities  external research and development funding and various other lease and debt instruments 
the company s working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   and million at december  net cash provided by operations was approximately million in  compared to million during and million during despite weakened operating results during  cash flow from operations increased primarily as a result of increased focus on accounts receivable collections activities 
excluding cash received from atmi s convertible debt offering in the fourth quarter of  management reduced working capital by approximately million during  or 
the cash flow from operations for resulted primarily from improvements in operating results compared to  substantially offset by increased working capital requirements mainly accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  the million of merger costs in reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  with approximately million remaining unpaid at december  in  operating cash flows improvement was driven primarily from an improvement in operating results  partially offset by increases in working capital accounts and deferred taxes 
in addition  the million of merger costs and related expenses in reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as million were non cash charges and approximately million remained unpaid at december  net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the significant increase in capital expenditures primarily related to installation of compound semiconductor manufacturing capacity at the company s new epitaxial services facility in phoenix  arizona  the construction of a new liquid materials manufacturing facility in burnet  texas  and the expansion of the danbury  connecticut research and development facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december  the company s cash and cash equivalents included money market securities  municipal bond obligations and commercial paper 
due to the short maturity of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s portfolio  therefore  the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the company s securities portfolio 
as of december   a majority of the company s debt carries fixed interest rates  therefore  the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows
