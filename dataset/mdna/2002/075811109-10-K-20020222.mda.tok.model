immunodiagnostics sales increases were primarily due to the combination of shipments of our new access immunoassay system  shipments of our newly cleared access accutni tm troponin i cardiac test  and other access immunoassay product sales 
cellular analysis sales increases were primarily due  in part  to shipments of the new coulter lh hematology instrument 
life science research sales increases were primarily due to sales of the biomek fx laboratory automation workstation 
improved sales in the americas were led by robotic automation genetic analysis  routine chemistry and immunodiagnostics products  while improved sales in europe and asia were due to strong sales of robotic automation genetic analysis and immunodiagnostics products 

table of contents as indicated above  we announced the formation of three divisions aligned with the biomedical testing continuum during clinical diagnostics  life science research and specialty testing 
the following provides the recategorized key product sales results for these three divisions during and reported sales sales growth routine chemistry immunodiagnostics total chemistry hematology total clinical diagnostics robotic automation genetic analysis centrifuge analytical systems total life science research total specialty testing total beckman coulter gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin in was  percentage points lower than the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin was due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates  which resulted in a gross profit decrease of approximately million  or percentage points 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year 
the improvement in sg a as a percentage of sales is primarily due to a million reversal of an accrual associated with a cross licensing agreement during the quarter ended march  excluding this accrual reversal  sg a as a percentage of sales would have been in  consistent with the prior year 
research and development r d expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to increased r d expenses associated with our immunomics operation 
r d as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to certain reorganization activities in europe 
in the fourth quarters of and  we reversed million and million  respectively  of excess restructure charges taken in prior years 
these charges and reversals resulted in net restructuring credits of million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense declined million to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on the variable portion of our borrowings 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of million  a write down of million for an equity investment in point of care testing  and gains on the sales of certain sales type lease receivables of million 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of million  a gain on the sale of a facility in japan of million and a gain on the sale of a facility in australia of million

table of contents sales growth during was affected by the following the clinical diagnostics segment  led by the americas  experienced strong sales growth in routine chemistry  driven by record placements of synchron lxs clinical systems and power processors 
immunodiagnostics sales growth was led by access immunoassay system unit placements and corresponding orders for consumables  including psa and free psa tests  offset by declines in protein testing in europe due to government reimbursement changes 
hematology sales declined due to significant backlog shipments of gen s tm slidemakers in cytometry growth was driven by new system sales and strong reagent demand 
the life science research segment was led by our robotic automation genetic analysis products  including placements of our biomek and new biomek fx liquid handling systems  and our new ceq tm xl dna analysis system  partially offset by decreased sales of analytical systems 
europe reported sales decreased in versus  as compared to a constant currency growth rate of for the same period as a result of the weakening euro compared to the us dollar 
asia sales were dampened due to softness in the japanese market 
gross margin in was  percentage points lower than the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin was due to three factors 
first  the effects of foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a gross profit decrease of approximately million or percentage points 
second  we had a slightly higher mix of instruments to after market sales of supplies  chemistry kits and services 
instruments typically have lower gross margins as compared to after market sales 
third  we had a one time million sale of clinical chemistry assets in spain in the first quarter of which contributed a lower gross margin than historical company levels 
on a constant currency basis  and excluding the aforementioned one time transaction  gross margin would have been in sg a expenses declined million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year 
the improvement in sg a as a percentage of sales is due to further synergies from the coulter integration 
r d expenses increased million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year 
the increase in r d is due to investments in new technologies  such as mhc tetramers 
during and  we reversed million and million  respectively  of excess restructuring charges that were taken in prior years 
these reversals resulted in net restructuring credits of million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense declined million to million in compared to million in primarily due to a million reduction in bank debt  partially offset by increased interest rates on the variable rate portion of our borrowings 
other non operating income increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in other non operating income is primarily due to increased income associated with foreign currency related activities 
net earnings for were million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in financial condition liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives into cash 
therefore  
table of contents liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements  and capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase between and of million is due to the following contributors increased earnings before depreciation  amortization and accounting change of million  increases in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and changes in other operating accounts that resulted in additional operating cash flows of million 
these contributors were partially offset by increases in the change in trade and other receivables of million 
the decrease between and of million is primarily due to decreases in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  partially offset by an increase in earnings before depreciation and amortization of million and a million improvement in converting accounts receivable into cash 
investing activities used million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase between and is primarily due to increases in property  plant and equipment additions associated with our implementation of an enterprise resource planning system see below for discussion and lower proceeds received from the sale of certain clinical chemistry assets in spain 
investing activities between and were consistent 
financing activities used million  million and million of cash flows in  and  respectively 
net cash paid to reduce our bank and other debt amounted to million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  we paid million  million and million in dividends to our stockholders in  and  respectively 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our strategies for growth require a flexible infrastructure 
as a result of an aggressive acquisition schedule in and  there are multiple systems and processes currently in use throughout the company 
we have chosen to implement an oracle enterprise resource planning system erp to achieve a single  globally integrated infrastructure 
this includes functionality for finance  human resources  supply chain  order management  sales and service to replace or complement existing legacy systems and business processes 
we expect that the majority of the work required to implement these new systems will take place through if we are unable to implement and effectively manage the transition to this new integrated system  our future consolidated operating results could be adversely affected 
based upon current levels of operations  anticipated cost savings and future growth  we believe our cash flow from operations including the continued ability to sell sales type lease receivables  see note sale of assets of the consolidated financial statements  together with available borrowings under the credit facility which amounts to million as of december  and expires in october  see note debt financing of the consolidated financial statements and other sources of liquidity including other credit facilities  leases and any other available financing sources will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for interest payments and other debt service obligations  working capital  capital expenditures  lease payments and other operating needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that estimated cost savings or growth can be achieved 
future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance existing indebtedness  will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 

table of contents in november  the company issued million of unsecured senior notes due november  the proceeds received were used to pay down the credit facility 
interest on these senior notes is payable semi annually in may and november see note debt financing of the consolidated financial statements 
we are in the process of negotiating a new credit facility  which we anticipate finalizing prior to the expiration of our current credit facility in october during the quarter ended june   our senior long term credit rating at moody s investors service was upgraded to baa 
during the quarter ended september   our senior long term credit rating at standard poor s was upgraded to bbb 
these upgrades  combined with fitch  inc s bbb senior long term credit rating  give us an investment grade rating at all three of our rating agencies  improves our financial profile and should enhance our ability to borrow in the future at relatively more favorable rates 
the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period total thereafter long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding in their calls on judgment 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to reserves for doubtful accounts  inventory adjustments for write down of inventories to fair value  environmental and legal obligations  and tax valuation allowances and obligations 
we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
financial risk management our risk management program  developed by senior management and approved by the board of directors  seeks to minimize the potentially negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on the results of operations 
our primary exposures to fluctuations in the financial markets are to changes in foreign exchange risk and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk arises because our reporting currency is the us dollar and we generate approximately of our revenues in various foreign currencies 
us dollar denominated costs and expenses as a percentage of total operating costs and expenses are much greater than us dollar denominated sales as a percentage of total net sales 
as a result  appreciation of the us dollar against our major trading currencies has a negative impact on our results of operations  and depreciation of the us dollar against such currencies has a positive impact 
we seek to minimize our exposure to changes in exchange rates by denominating costs and expenses in foreign currencies 
when these opportunities are exhausted  we use derivative financial instruments to function as hedges 
we use forward contracts  purchased option contracts  and complex option contracts consisting of purchased and sold options  to hedge certain foreign currency denominated transactions 
we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents our exposure to interest rate risk arises out of our long term debt obligations 
under the guidance of our risk management policies  we use derivative contracts on certain borrowing transactions 
with the aid of these contracts  we seek to reduce the negative effects of changes in interest rates by changing the character of the interest rate on our long term debt  converting a fixed rate to a variable rate and vice versa 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our investment portfolio  which consists of short term investments maturity of less than a year 
inflation we continually monitor inflation and the effects of changing prices 
inflation increases the cost of goods and services used 
competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets restrict our ability to fully recover the higher costs of acquired goods and services through price increases 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation by implementing continuous process improvement solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency and  as a result  lower costs and operating expenses 
the effects of inflation have  in our opinion  been managed appropriately and as a result have not had a material impact on our operations and the resulting financial position or liquidity 
environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
although we continue to make expenditures for environmental protection  we do not anticipate any significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations that would have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
we believe our operations comply in all material respects with applicable federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
to address contingent environmental costs  we establish reserves when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
based on current information and regulatory compliance taking third party indemnities into consideration  we believe we have established adequate reserves for environmental expenditures 
we may incur additional costs that exceed the reserves 
however  based on current knowledge  we do not expect such amounts to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity  although we do not give any assurance in this regard 
see further discussion in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 
litigation we are currently  and are from time to time  subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business 
some examples of the types of claims are intellectual property  contractual obligations  and employment matters 
in certain such actions  the plaintiffs may request punitive or other damages or nonmonetary relief  which may not be covered by insurance 
if granted  nonmonetary relief could materially affect the conduct of our business 
we accrue for probable liabilities involved in these matters as they become known and can be reasonably estimated 
in our opinion taking third party indemnities into consideration  the various asserted claims and litigation in which we are currently involved are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
however  we do not give any assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such claims and litigation 
the resolution of such claims and litigation could be material to our operating results for any particular period  depending on the level of income for such period 
see further discussion of these matters in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents euro the new european currency the countries of the european union have adopted a single currency  the euro 
the euro came into existence on january   and could have been used for transactions within and between the countries of the economic and monetary union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  holland  ireland  italy  luxembourg  portugal and spain  with national currencies expressed as a denomination national currency units of the euro 
during the three year transition period following its introduction  countries were allowed to transact business both in the euro and in their own currencies at fixed exchange rates 
on january   the euro became the only currency in economic and monetary union countries 
we conduct business in approximately countries  generating approximately of revenues outside the united states 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in europe 
the introduction of the euro required that we make modifications to our internal operations as well as to our external business arrangements 
we established a six member task force that identified the issues related to the introduction of the euro and developed and implemented a plan to address those issues 
we adopted the euro for internal systems and reporting as of december  the adoption of the euro did not have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
recent accounting developments goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
we are required to adopt sfas on january  however  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  are subject to the amortization provisions of sfas our revised estimate associated with the adoption of sfas is that amortization expense will decrease by million net of income taxes of million 
asset retirement obligations sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we are required to adopt sfas on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations 
business climate the clinical diagnostics and life science research markets are highly competitive with many manufacturers around the world 
these markets continue to be unfavorably impacted by the economic weakness in parts of europe  asia and latin america and government and healthcare cost containment initiatives in general 
the life science research market also continues to be affected by governmental constraints on research and development spending outside the united states 
in the clinical diagnostics market  attempts to lower costs and to increase productivity have led to further consolidation among healthcare providers in the united states  resulting in more powerful provider groups that continue to leverage their purchasing power to contain costs 
preferred supplier arrangements and combined purchases are becoming more commonplace 
consequently  it has become essential for manufacturers to provide cost effective diagnostic systems to remain competitive 
cost containment initiatives in the united states and in the european healthcare systems will continue to be factors which may affect our ability to maintain or increase sales 
future profitability may also be adversely affected if the relative value of the us dollar strengthens against certain currencies 
the continuing consolidation trend among united states healthcare providers  mentioned previously  has increased pressure on diagnostic equipment manufacturers to broaden their product offerings to encompass a 
table of contents wider range of testing capability  greater automation and higher volume capacity at a lower cost 
our acquisition of coulter was a clear indicator of our resolve to become a broad based world leader in in vitro diagnostic testing by expanding our product offerings 
beckman coulter is now the world s leading manufacturer of hematology systems for the clinical analysis of blood cells  where we have a market share twice the size of our next largest competitor 
in addition  beckman coulter is considered a technology leader in cell counting and characterization and has a number two position in flow cytometry  which is used for both research and clinical applications 
with our leadership position in cellular analysis and our extensive capabilities in routine chemistry and immunodiagnostics  we are able to offer a broad range of automated systems that together can perform more than of a hospital laboratory s testing needs and essentially of the blood tests that are considered routine 
we believe we are able to provide significant value added benefits  enhanced through our expertise in simplifying and automating laboratory processes  to our customers 
in the life science research market  us supported research has been positive in recent years but is subject to yearly approval by congress 
continued positive funding is not guaranteed and may be negatively impacted by a prolonged recession or attempts to contain government spending in order to balance the budget and reduce deficit spending 
spending on research by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is also dependent on global economic health 
an ongoing recession can affect the number of biotechnology start ups building laboratories and conducting research as well as the rate of research investment by biopharmaceuticals 
pharmaceutical company research investment may be further negatively impacted by government intervention and regulation  including prescription drug costs 
our new products originate from four sources internal research and development programs  external collaborative efforts with individuals in academic institutions and technology companies  devices and techniques that are generated in customers laboratories  and business and technology acquisitions 
during  we made a commitment to the commercialization of a new tetramer technology  which operates on flow cytometry platforms 
this new cellular immune response technology has the potential to establish an entirely new testing category for measuring and monitoring the immune response system 
we have established an immunomics operation to focus on this technology with shipments of our first ready to use itag tm mhc tetramer reagents for hiv and melanoma occurring in the fourth quarter of during  we introduced three additional ready to use mhc tetramer research reagents for cytomegalovirus cmv  epstein barr virus ebv  and influenza 
we also provided custom tetramer reagents to several bio pharma companies for use in clinical trials 
the size and growth of our markets are influenced by a number of factors  including technological innovation in bioanalytical practice  government funding for basic and disease related research for example  heart disease  aids and cancer  research and development spending by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  healthcare spending  and physician practice patterns 

table of contents we expect worldwide healthcare expenditures and diagnostic testing to increase over the long term  primarily as a result of the following growing demand for services generated by the increasing size and aging of the world population  increasing expenditures on diseases requiring costly or extended treatment for example  aids and cancer  and expanding demand for improved healthcare services in developing countries 
in addition to the business climate factors discussed previously  certain economic factors may influence our business currency fluctuations as approximately of our revenues are generated outside the united states and given the recent fluctuations in foreign currencies  we may experience volatility in sales  operating income and other non operating income and expense  and interest rates as approximately of our debt is under variable interest rate terms 
this percentage includes the effect of our reverse interest rate swap derivatives which change the character of the interest rate on certain of our long term debt by effectively converting a fixed rate to a variable rate 
income taxes we are subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and income tax liabilities will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in particular jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which income is repatriated  and future changes in the law 
generally  our income tax liability in a particular jurisdiction is determined either on an entity by entity non consolidated basis or on a consolidated basis including only those entities incorporated in the same jurisdiction 
in those jurisdictions where consolidated tax reporting is not permitted  we may pay income taxes even though  on an overall basis  we may have incurred a net loss for the tax year 
forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements  including statements regarding  among other items the schedule for completion of our erp program  anticipated debt reduction  cash flow available to be applied to debt reduction and the availability of additional financing  our business strategy  the impacts of recent accounting changes  particularly the adoption of sfas  anticipated trends in our business and plans to reduce indebtedness  our liquidity requirements and capital resources  anticipated proceeds from sales of assets  the effects of euro conversion and inflation on our operations  and earnings and sales growth 

table of contents these forward looking statements are based on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to unanticipated delays in completing our erp program  complexity and uncertainty regarding development of new high technology products  loss of market share through aggressive competition in the clinical diagnostic  life science research and specialty testing markets  our dependence on capital spending policies and government funding  the effects of potential healthcare reforms  changes in estimates associated with the adoption of sfas  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates  reliance on patents and other intellectual property  global economic and political conditions  unanticipated reductions in cash flows and difficulty in sales of assets  the finalization of a new credit facility  future effective tax rates  and other factors that cannot be identified at this time 
although we believe we have the product offerings and resources required to achieve our objectives  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that events anticipated by these forward looking statements will in fact transpire as expected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange and interest rates in their form k filings 
several alternatives  all with some limitations  have been offered 
the following discussion is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this analysis is constrained by several factors  including the following it is based on a single point in time  and it does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the changes modeled 
although the results of the analysis may be useful as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  australian dollar and the canadian dollar 
as of december   the net fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts was an unrecognized gain of million 
we estimated the sensitivity of the fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts to a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the spot exchange rates for the us dollar against the foreign currencies at december  the analysis showed that a strengthening of the us dollar would result in a gain in fair value of million and a weakening of the us dollar would result in a loss in fair value of million in these instruments 
losses and gains on the underlying transactions being hedged would largely offset any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
our december  significant foreign currency exposures were not significantly different than those at december  
table of contents similarly  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our variable rate debt instruments and derivatives 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to decrease or increase next year s pre tax earnings by million based on the amount of debt outstanding at year end 
a comparable analysis at december  indicated that a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to decrease or increase pre tax earnings by million based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  the decrease in the sensitivity analysis of million is due to the decrease in our debt under variable interest rate terms including the effect of our reverse interest rate swap derivatives which change the character of the interest rate on our long term debt by effectively converting a fixed rate to a variable rate 
additional information with respect to our foreign currency and interest rate exposures are discussed in note derivatives of the consolidated financial statements
