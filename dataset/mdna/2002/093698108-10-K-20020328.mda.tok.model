part i item business introduction blonder tongue laboratories  inc blonder tongue or the company is a designer  manufacturer and supplier of a comprehensive line of electronics and systems equipment for the cable television catv industry both franchise and non franchise  or private  cable 
the company s products are used to acquire  distribute and protect the broad range of communications signals carried on fiber optic  coaxial cable and wireless distribution systems 
these products are sold to customers providing an array of communications services  including television  high speed data internet and telephony  to single family dwellings  multiple dwelling units mdus  the lodging industry and institutions such as hospitals  prisons  schools and marinas 
the company s products are also used in surveillance systems ranging in complexity from simple in home monitoring systems to advanced business security systems with hundreds of cameras 
staying at the forefront of the telecommunications broadband technology revolution is a continuing challenge 
the company continues to add products to respond to the changes taking place 
blonder tongue s product line includes digital satellite receivers  cable modems  fiber communications network components  qpsk to qam transcoders for directv  echostar and digicipher ii mpeg satellite services digicipher ii compatible qam set top converters  and a broad range of interdiction products to preserve signal security 
the company s principal customers are system integrators both franchise and private cable operators  as well as contractors that design  package  install and in most instances operate  upgrade and maintain the systems they build 
the company has historically enjoyed  and continues to enjoy  a dominant market position in the private cable industry  while progressively making inroads into the franchise cable market 
as the company has expanded its market coverage  however  the distinctions between private cable and franchise cable have become blurred 
for example  the most efficient  highest revenue producing private cable systems and small franchise cable systems are built with the same electronic building blocks 
most of the electronics required are available from blonder tongue 
in fact  some of the most financially successful cable systems in the united states employ blonder tongue interdiction equipment 
the company continues to expand its headend  fiber and data product lines to maintain the capability of providing all the electronic equipment needed to build small cable systems and much of the equipment needed in larger systems for most efficient operation and highest profitability in high density areas 
industry overview the broadband signal distribution industry involving the high speed transmission of television  telephony and internet signals is currently dominated by catv 
the markets for wireless  direct broadcast satellite dbs and digital subscriber line dsl used for this purpose are growing rapidly 
within the catv market there are an increasing number of metropolitan areas that have awarded second catv franchises to create competition with the existing franchisee 
the government has been in favor of competition in this market and has passed regulations to encourage it 
franchise cable companies are ever watchful of dbs penetration in their franchise areas and react rapidly to competition  all to the eventual benefit of the consumer 
to fight competition  the operators offer more services and more tv channels as well as discounted prices 
the lineup of services typically includes an analog block of channels from to mhz  high speed data service using high speed cable modems  cable telephony either interfacing with switched networks or internet protocol networks  and digital television in the to mhz range 
these upgraded services are possible in every system that has been rebuilt to mhz of bandwidth 
the standard architecture for these enhanced systems contemplates a hybrid distribution network with a combination of fiber optic cable to nodes of to subscribers  with coaxial cable from the node to the customer and full reverse path capability for the pay per view  data and phone services 
the traditional customer targeted for these expanded services is a homeowner likely to remain in the same home as a long term subscriber 
for a variety of reasons  including the transient nature of the residents of many areas  high levels of theft of service and excessive cost of replacing lost or stolen converters and modems  approximately of catv subscribers not only are not offered the new services  but are never offered the full analog lineup of channels 
since converters  dbs receivers  digital converters and modems are offered at very low prices to stimulate sales  the operational costs in these demographic areas are too high to justify the advanced services 
to retain customers in these areas  a technology must be used that minimizes the operational losses due to theft and churn while providing a level of video  data and phone service that compares favorably with dbs  dsl and wireless providers 
the company believes that its lineup of products  which includes interdiction as well as cable and telephone modems  is the ideal solution for deployment in these areas 
in october  the company entered into an agreement to be a value added distributor for motorola s qam decoder to the united states private cable and canadian franchise cable markets 
coupling this product with the company s digicipher r ii compatible qqqt transcoder provides a low cost hardware solution for small system operators that want to offer digital programming from sources such as hits r  wsnet tm  and cancom 
catv most catv operators are building fiber optic networks with alternative combinations of fiber optic and coaxial cable to deliver television signal programming data and phone services on one drop cable 
catv s deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in more than of existing systems 
the system architecture being employed to accomplish the combined provision of television and telephone service is a hybrid fiber coaxial hfc network 
in an hfc network  fiber optic trunk lines connect to nodes which feed to subscribers  using coaxial cable 
extensive rebuilding of a catv system is required to provide the full array of expanded services 
consequently  not only are the alternative suppliers faced with enormous capital expenditures to enter the broadband signal delivery business  but existing catv system operators are faced with similar expenditures to compete with them or to discourage them from entering the race to provide the information superhighway 
the company believes that most major metropolitan areas will eventually have complex networks of two or more independent operators interconnecting the homes while private cable operators will have large networks interconnecting many multi dwelling complexes 
all of these networks are potential users of blonder tongue headend  digital and interdiction products 
multiple dwelling units mdus mdus  because they represent a large percentage of the private cable market  have historically been responsible for a large percentage of the company s sales 
in the early days of cable television mdus were served by franchise cable operators 
in  when the fcc allocated a designated frequency band for private cable  the private cable industry became a major supplier of tv services to mdus since they could interconnect buildings with ghz over the air links and reduce the cost per subscriber in building mdu networks 
this type of networking continues today but presently many mdu private cable systems are connected using fiber optics since it is more reliable  has much greater bandwidth  and can handle two way communication needed for voice  data and video on demand 
mdus served by franchise cable are also a large revenue source for blonder tongue since they generally fall into the category of customers where churn  theft of service and converter loss are extremely high 
this makes these areas prime candidates for blonder tongue s interdiction products 
lodging until the early s  one system integrator dominated the lodging market and manufactured much of its own equipment 
during the last ten years  other private cable integrators have successfully entered and expanded the lodging market by offering systems with more channels  video on demand and interactivity 
these systems have been well received in the market  as property owners have sought additional revenues and guests have demanded increased in room conveniences 
the integrators leading this market evolution rely upon outside suppliers for their system electronics and are blonder tongue customers 
these companies and others offer lodging establishments vcr based systems which provide true video on demand movies with a large selection of titles 
to meet these demands  the typical lodging system headend will include as many as to receivers and as many as to modulators  and will be capable of providing the guest with more free channels  video on demand for a broad selection of movie titles  and interactive services such as remote check out and concierge services 
this is in contrast to the systems which preceded them which typically had to receivers and modulators and provided six to ten free channels and two to five channels of vcr based movies running at published scheduled times 
there is an accelerating trend to substitute video file servers for vcrs  which the company believes will eventually replace vcrs in video on demand systems 
the timing and speed of this transition is dependent on availability of lower cost servers 
most of the systems with video on demand service were initially in large hotels  where the economics of high channel capacity systems are more easily justified 
the conversion of hotel pay per view systems into video on demand is increasing 
smaller hotels and motels are being provided with video on demand as technology results in reduced headend costs  keeping the market growth reasonably steady 
international for much of the world  catv service lags the united states  but is rapidly expanding as technological advancement reduces the cost to consumers 
in addition  economic development in latin america and asia has allowed first time construction of integrated delivery systems that utilize a variety of electronics and broadband hardware 
the pace of growth is difficult to predict  but as more alternatives become available and television service becomes increasingly affordable  it is likely that more equipment will be placed in the field 
the company utilizes several distributors in florida and within latin america with an experienced international sales manager supervising this effort 
earlier efforts to expand the market through exclusive distribution arrangements were unsatisfactory but some growth was achieved in and accelerated growth is anticipated in the year and beyond as the company s contacts and opportunities in the caribbean and latin america continue to mature 
additional considerations the technological revolution taking place in the communications industry  which includes dbs  is providing digital television to an increasing number of homes 
wireless cable systems and dsl over twisted pair phone lines also utilize digital compression to provide channel capacity which is competitive with catv and other television delivery systems 
in addition  franchise cable companies and alternative suppliers are building fiber optic networks to offer video  data  and telephony 
there is also the possibility of convergence of data and video communications  wherein computer and television systems merge and the computer monitor replaces the television screen 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty which technology will be dominant in the future  it is clear that digitized video and advances in the ability to compress the digitized video signal make both digital television and the convergence of computer  telephone and television systems technically possible 
since united states television sets are analog not digital  direct satellite television and other digitally compressed programming requires headend products or expensive set top decoding receivers or converters to convert the digitally transmitted satellite signals back to analog 
the replacement of all television sets with digital sets will be costly and take many years to complete 
the company believes that for many years to come  program providers will be required to deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers television sets using headend products at some distribution point in their networks or employ decoding receivers at each television set 
headend products are a large segment of blonder tongue s business and the company believes interdiction is an ideal product for a system operator to use to control access to the multitude of programming that will be available 
products blonder tongue s products can be separated  according to function  into the several categories described below o headend products used by a system operator for signal acquisition  processing and manipulation for further transmission 
among the products offered by the company in this category are satellite receivers digital and analog  integrated receiver decoders  transcoders  demodulators  modulators  antennas and antenna mounts  amplifiers  equalizers  and processors 
the headend of a television signal distribution system is the brain of the system  the central location where the multi channel signal is initially received  converted and allocated to specific channels for distribution 
in some cases  where the signal is transmitted in encrypted form or digitized and compressed  the receiver will also be required to decode the signal or  in the case where digital signals are to be carried on the distribution system  transcode its modulation from qpsk quadrature phase shift key to qam quadrature amplitude modulation since one is optimum for satellite transmission and the other optimum for fiber coaxial distribution 
blonder tongue is a licensee of motorola  inc s motorola videocipher r and digicipher r encryption technologies and hughes network systems  a hughes electronics corporation hughes digital technologies  and integrates their decoders into integrated receiver decoder products  where required 
the company estimates that headend products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in o distribution products used to permit signals to travel from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home  apartment unit  hotel room  office or other terminal location along a distribution network of fiber optic or coaxial cable 
among the products offered by the company in this category are optical transmitters  optical receivers  line extenders  broadband amplifiers  directional taps  splitters and wall taps 
in catv systems  the distribution products are either mounted on exterior telephone poles or encased in pedestals  vaults or other security devices 
in private cable systems the distribution system is typically enclosed within the walls of the building if a single structure or added to an existing structure using various techniques to hide the coaxial cable and devices 
the non passive devices within this category are designed to ensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination to provide high quality audio video images 
o subscriber products used to control access to programming at the subscriber s location and to split and amplify incoming signals for transmission to multiple sites and multiple television sets within a site 
among the products offered by the company in this category are addressable interdiction devices  cable modems  splitters  couplers and multiplexers 
the company believes that the most significant products within this category are i its videomask tm addressable signal jammer  licensed from philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate philips broadband networks  inc in august under certain non exclusive technology and patent license agreements the philips license agreements  ii the smi interdiction product line acquired from scientific atlanta  inc as part of its interdiction business  and iii its recently introduced cable modems for high speed internet access 
interdiction products limit  through jamming of particular channels  the availability of programs to subscribers 
such products enable an integrator to control subscriber access to premium channels and other enhanced services through a computer located off premises 
they also eliminate the necessity of an operator having to make a service call to install or remove passive traps and eliminate the costs associated with damage or loss of analog set top converters in the subscribers locations 
interdiction products are also being successfully used by catv operators as an anti piracy system in conjunction with set top converters 
the company believes that the reduction in operating costs  programming piracy  and converter loss which can be obtained through the use of interdiction will be a significant factor in further product penetration into the franchise cable market 
while it is not possible to predict the breadth of market acceptance for these products  the company believes the potential is substantial in both the private cable market and franchise cable market as alternatives to  or in conjunction with  set top converters and as a viable option for companies and municipalities who are overbuilding existing cable infrastructures and are seeking a more consumer friendly and cost effective way to compete with the incumbent franchise cable operator 
o microwave products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using point to point communication links in the ghz range of frequencies 
among the products offered by the company in this category are power amplifiers  repeaters  receivers  transmitters and compatible accessories 
these products convert the headend output up to the microwave band and transmit this signal using parabolic antennas 
at each receiver site  a parabolic antenna receiver combination converts the signal back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers at the receiver site 
due to a final rule and order adopted by the federal communications commission fcc in june   coupled with the availability and inherent superiority of fiber optics in linking adjacent properties in mdu applications  sales of microwave products have diminished 
while microwave products will continue to be sold to maintain existing systems  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
o fiber products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using fiber optic cable 
among the products offered are optical transmitters  receivers  couplers  splitters and compatible accessories 
these products convert rf frequencies to light or infrared frequencies and launch them on optical fiber 
at each receiver site  an optical receiver is used to convert the signals back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers 
sales of products in this category continue to increase as they have become the product of choice in applications formerly suitable to the use of microwave products 
the company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements 
typically  these modifications are minor and do not materially alter the functionality of the products 
thus the inability of the customer to accept such products does not generally result in the company being otherwise unable to sell such products to other customers 
research and product development the markets served by blonder tongue are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete effectively in this environment  the company must engage in continuous research and development in order to i create new products  ii expand the frequency range of existing products in order to accommodate customer demand for greater channel capacity  iii license new technology such as digital satellite receiver decoders and high speed cable modems  and iv acquire products incorporating technology that could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources  to suit the dynamics of the evolving marketplace 
research and development projects are often initially undertaken at the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the company s customers and customer prospects with the expectation or promise of substantial future orders from such customers or customer prospects 
additional research and development efforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and engineering to lower production costs 
for the acquisition of new technologies  the company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties when the company believes that it can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than the company could otherwise develop on its own  or when the desired technology is proprietary to a third party 
there were employees in the research and development department of the company at december  marketing and sales blonder tongue markets and sells its products worldwide to private cable integrators which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal year and approximately for fiscal year  to alternative suppliers  and to franchise cable integrators 
sales are made directly to customers by the company s internal sales force  as well as through numerous domestic and international stocking distributors 
the company s sales and marketing function is predominantly performed by its internal sales force 
should it be deemed necessary  the company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to specific customer prospects 
the company s internal sales force consists of employees  which currently includes salespersons eight salespersons in old bridge  new jersey  one salesperson in each of cincinnati  ohio  cudahy  wisconsin  folsom  california  and miami  florida and sales support personnel at the company headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s standard customer payment terms are  net days 
from time to time where the company determines that circumstances warrant  such as when a customer agrees to commit to a large blanket purchase order  the company extends payment terms beyond its standard payment terms 
the company has several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of its products 
blonder tongue participates in industry trade shows and conferences 
the company also publishes technical articles in trade and technical journals  distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations plan to ensure complete coverage of blonder tongue s products and technology by editors of trade journals 
the company provides system design engineering for its customers  maintains extensive ongoing communications with many original equipment manufacturer customers and provides one on one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential new customers 
blonder tongue supplies sales and applications support  product literature and training to its sales representatives and distributors 
the management of the company travels extensively  identifying customer needs and meeting potential customers 
the company had approximately million and million in purchase orders as of december  and december   respectively 
all of the purchase orders outstanding as of december  are expected to be shipped prior to december  the purchase orders are for the future delivery of products and are subject to cancellation by the customer 
customers blonder tongue has a broad customer base  which in consisted of more than active accounts 
approximately   and of the company s revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to the company s five largest customers 
in  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately of the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to these entities  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
however  the company anticipates that these customers will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods  although none of them is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products beyond outstanding purchase orders or to provide the company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
the complement of leading customers may shift as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
the company believes that many integrators will grow rapidly  and as such the company s success will depend in part on the viability of those customers and on the company s ability to maintain its position in the overall marketplace by shifting its emphasis to those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the company s leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or the company s inability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators which may replace the present leading customers  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental united states  however  the company also derives revenues from customers outside the continental united states  primarily in underdeveloped countries 
television service is less developed in many international markets  particularly latin america and asia  creating opportunity for those participants who offer quality products at a competitive price 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal years  and all of the company s transactions with customers located outside of the continental united states are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the company has no material foreign currency transactions 
manufacturing and suppliers blonder tongue s manufacturing operations are located at the company s headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the assembly and testing of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts  printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication from raw sheet metal of chassis and cabinets for such assemblies 
management continues to implement a significant number of changes to the manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost  including logistics modifications on the factory floor  an increased use of surface mount  axial lead and radial lead robotics to place electronic components on printed circuit boards  a continuing program of circuit board redesign to make more products compatible with robotic insertion equipment and an increased integration in machining and fabrication 
all of these efforts are consistent with and part of the company s strategy to provide its customers with high performance to cost ratio products 
outside contractors supply standard components  etch printed circuit boards  and electronic subassemblies to the company s specifications 
while the company generally purchases electronic parts which do not have a unique source  certain electronic component parts used within the company s products are available from a limited number of suppliers and can be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such component parts 
if the company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part  the company believes that alternative parts could be obtained or system design changes implemented 
however  in such situations the company may experience temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by the component shortage 
the company purchases several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as the videocipher r and digicipher r encryption systems manufactured by motorola  which are standard encryption methodologies employed on us c band and ku band transponders and hughes digital satellite receivers for delivery of directv tm programming 
an inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of these components could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company does not have a supply agreement with motorola or any other supplier 
the company submits purchase orders to its suppliers on an as needed basis 
blonder tongue maintains a quality assurance program which tests samples of component parts purchased  as well as its finished products  on an ongoing basis and also conducts tests throughout the manufacturing process using commercially available and in house built testing systems that incorporate proprietary procedures 
blonder tongue performs final product tests on of its products prior to shipment to customers 
competition all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than blonder tongue which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to the company sell directly as well as through distributors into the franchise and private cable marketplaces 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the company 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than blonder tongue 
the company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could result in price reductions  loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders 
the principal methods of competition are product differentiation  performance and quality  price and terms  service  and technical and administrative support 
intellectual property the company currently holds united states patents and foreign patents covering a wide range of electronic systems and circuits  of which united states patents and foreign patents were obtained in the company s acquisition of scientific atlanta  inc s interdiction business during other than certain of the patents acquired from scientific atlanta  inc  none of the company s patents are considered material to the company s present operations because they do not relate to high volume applications 
because of the rapidly evolving nature of the catv industry  the company believes that its market position as a supplier to cable integrators derives primarily from its ability to develop a continuous stream of new products which are designed to meet its customers needs and which have a high performance to cost ratio 
the company is a licensee of philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate philips broadband networks  inc  motorola  hughes and several smaller software development companies 
under the philips license agreements  the company is granted a non exclusive license for a term which expires in  concurrently with the last to expire of the relevant patents 
the philips license agreements provide for the payment by the company of a one time license fee and for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
the company is a licensee of motorola relating to motorola s videocipher r encryption technology and is also a party to a private label agreement with motorola relating to its digicipher r technology 
under the videocipher r license agreement  the company is granted a non exclusive license under certain proprietary know how  to design and manufacture certain licensed products to be compatible with the videocipher r commercial descrambler module 
the videocipher r license agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
the videocipher r license agreement also provides for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
under the digicipher r private label agreement  the company is granted the non exclusive right to sell digicipher r ii integrated receiver decoders bearing the blonder tongue name for use in the commercial market 
the digicipher r private label agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
during  the company entered into several software development and license agreements for specifically designed controller and interface software necessary for the operation of the company s video central tm remote interdiction control system  which is used for remote operation of videomask tm signal jammers installed at subscriber locations 
these licenses are perpetual and require the payment of a one time license fee and in one case additional payments  the aggregate of which are not material 
in february   the company entered into an exclusive license agreement with hughes  pursuant to which the company is licensed to design  manufacture  and market commercial digital satellite receivers which are compatible with directv tm programming  for use in headend applications in both the franchised and private cable markets 
the agreement is for a term of five years  expiring in february the company relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and know how 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technologies and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know how independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the company s products and such competition could adversely affect the prices for the company s products or the company s market share 
the company also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining its leadership position 
regulation private cable  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
franchise cable operators had been subject to extensive government regulation pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future rate increases 
the telecommunications act of has deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and has opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
the company believes that this legislation will increase the base of potential customers for the company s products 
in june   the fcc adopted and issued a final rule and order relating to the re designation of portions of the ghz frequency band among the various currently allocated services 
this matter was first discussed in  at which time the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking  proposing to grant primary status for use of the ghz frequency band to fixed satellite service operators fsso  to the detriment of existing and future terrestrial fixed service operators tfso 
the final rules regarding this issue provide for the grandfathering  for a period of ten years  of certain pre existing installed tfsos and tfsos that had made application for a license prior to a certain date 
the fcc segmented the ghz frequency band into several sub bands and has provided for varying obligations and rights as between the tfsos and the fssos 
overall  the final rules are complex and place a measure of uncertainty upon tfsos considering the use of microwave gear in new systems 
these issues  coupled with the recent advances in the use of fiber optic cable and the inherent superiority in fiber due to its greater bandwidth capability  have resulted in a shift in customer purchases away from microwave gear and toward fiber optics 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
the company did not incur in and does not anticipate incurring in material capital expenditures for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on the company 
further  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
any failure by the company to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
the company presently holds a permit from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep  division of environmental quality  air pollution control program relating to its operation of certain process equipment  which permit expires in june  the company has held such a permit for this equipment on a substantially continuous basis since approximately april  the company also has authorization under the new jersey pollution discharge elimination system discharge to surface waters general industrial stormwater permit  permit no
