item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result s of operations overview we manage the production of a majority of our products utilizing our facility in tampa  florida and through independent assembly contractors located primarily in mexico  the caribbean basin and central america 
we also source finished goods from independent suppliers 
for goods assembled by independent manufacturers  we purchase and inventory all of our raw materials and cut our fabric in our tampa cutting facility based on expected customer orders 
we ship cut fabric parts and other product components via common carrier to the independent manufacturers  who assemble compone nts into finished garments except for labeling and packaging in the case of private brand products and perform certain f inishing processes 
we have no material contractual arrangements with our independent manufacturers and pay them based on a s pecified unit price for actual first quality units produced 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our production labor and ove rhead is variable 
we ship assembled goods from mexico  the caribbean basin and central america to our tampa  florida and santa teresa  new mexico distribution centers via common carrier 
upon receipt of a customer order confirmation  we ship the product directly to customers or  in the case of private brand products  attach designated labels and point of sale packaging and then ship the product to our customers 
our results of operations for fiscal and were adversely imp acted by negative economic trends including increasing unemployment  declines in the us equity markets and decreased consumer conf idence 
during these periods  apparel retailers sought to increase consumer demand and reduce inventories with aggressive price dis counting  particularly in the department store channel 
in addition  certain producers made brands available to mass merchants and discounters that normally were distributed through department and specialty stores 
although our margins did decline during th is period  we maintained our strategy not to sacrifice product quality  customer service and profitable results 
additionally  sales of our savane r brand have declined significantl y since the beginning of fiscal due to declines in the department store channel where the savane r product is generally sold 
w e have expanded our distribution of the savane r brand through major new core replenishment programs with jc penney  kohl s and me rvyn s 
these programs  which began shipping in fiscal  are expected to reverse the pattern of savane s recent declines 
savane consolidation on april   we announced a plan to consolidate the admini strative  cutting and related functions of our savane division in el paso  texas into our tampa  florida facility 
we intend to co mplete all aspects of this consolidation by march as part of the consolidation  we have vacated our el paso  texas administra tion building and cutting facility 
we are currently constructing additional administrative offices in tampa  florida  and the current tampa  florida cutting facility has sufficient capacity to accommodate the consolidated cutting operation 
we will conti nue to operate our distribution center in the el paso  texas area 
we have recently encountered difficulties in the consolidation of our el paso operations  particularly related to our cutting operations 
this has caused delays in delivering products to our c ustomers  and negatively impacted our results for our first quarter of fiscal we anticipate  however  that these difficultie s will be resolved during our second quarter of fiscal we also announced the reorganization of our south pacific division  i ncluding discontinuing production in factories in fiji that are partially owned by us 
production for our south pacific division wil l be sourced globally through lower cost  full packaged imports 
as a result of these initiatives internally referred to as proje ct synergy  we recorded a pre tax charge totaling approximately million in fiscal for severance million  relocation million  lease terminations million  asset write downs million and other related costs m illion 
we expect an additional million of costs associated with project synergy to be incurred in fiscal as of septem ber   we have approximately million of expenses accrued  related to exit costs  which primarily consist of lease te rminations  severance and related expenses 
except for the lease termination costs  these costs are expected to be paid during fisca l once completed  the impact of these initiatives is expected to generate annual pre tax cost savings of approximately mi llion beginning in fiscal we believe that project synergy will improve our ability to service our customers through one centraliz ed location 
the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted acc ounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenu es and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based on histor ical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of asset and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ mater ially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appr opriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a con sistent manner 
critical accounting policies contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including esti mated legal costs  when the obligations are probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies beco me known  we reassess our estimates and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly s ensitive to future changes include tax  legal and other regulatory matters such as import and export tariffs  which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or marke t 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we evaluate our inventory by style  color and size to determine exce ss or slow moving product based on projected sales 
we record provisions for markdowns and losses on excess and slow moving inventor y to the extent the cost of inventory exceeds estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions or competitive pressures cha nge  the level of inventory reserves would change 
reserve for allowances and doubtful accounts accounts receivabl e consists of amounts due from our customers from our normal business activities 
we maintain a reserve for allowances and doubtful accounts  which is based on historical collection and deduction write off experience  and an estimate of potential sales returns 
estimates for sales returns include provision for order shortages  purchase order variances and other customer discrepancies 
fo r fiscal  we have not provided a reserve for credit losses as substantially all of our receivables were assigned under factoring a greements  without recourse  except for credit losses on the first of amounts factored 
during fiscal  we intend to di scontinue factoring of our receivables  but expect to maintain credit insurance for those accounts which we deem necessary 
we wi ll continue to assess the adequacy of our reserves based on qualitative and quantitative measures 
long lived assets we estimate the depreciable lives of our proper ty  plant and equipment and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be im paired 
most of our property  plant and equipment are used in our cutting and distribution processes 
we periodically evaluate t he carrying value of assets which are held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
although we believe we have appropriately recorded our assets held for sale at their estimated fair value  net of esti mated disposal costs  the actual sale of these assets could result in gains or losses which could differ from our estimated amount s 
to assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash fl ows and other factors to determine whether the carrying values are recoverable from operations 
if these assumptions or estimates cha nge  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  we adopted fi nancial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement no 
on september  statement no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment 
the provisions of statement no 
require the co mpletion of a transitional impairment test within six months of adoption  with any impairment identified treated as a cumulati ve effect of a change in accounting principle 
also  statement no 
requires an annual impairment test 
in accordance with the provision of statement no 
 we performed the transitional and annual impairment tests during fiscal the results of these tests indicate that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not impaired  as the fair value of these assets exc eed their carrying value 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the evidence considered in making that determination includes  offsetting deferred tax lia bilities  future taxable income  as well as prudent tax planning strategies 
we have recorded deferred income tax assets related t o state net operating loss carryforwards  foreign net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain ot her accruals 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets relating to these operating loss carryforwar ds and accruals based on an evaluation of the benefits expected to be realized 
if we determine that we would be able to realize more of our net deferred tax assets than we currently expect  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which would have the effe ct of increasing income in the period that we make the determination 
conversely  if we determine that we will not be able to real ize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will increase the valuation allowance  which would have the ef fect of reducing income in the period that we make the determination 
the following discussion of our results of operations and financ ial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item of thi s report 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  select ed items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other charges operating income interest expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased to million fr om million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in units sold  a small portion of which rela ted to sales of duck head r branded product  which was acquired in august this increase was offset by a decrease in average se lling prices 
the decrease in average selling prices was due to our experiencing pricing pressure due to the weak retail conditions 
additionally  the average selling price was impacted by a change in mix of product sales as the higher average selling priced savane r products experienced declines in unit volume as the department store channel that savane was positioned in suffered declines in sal es 
we have expanded our distribution of the savane r brand through major new core replenishment programs with retailers 
the n ew expanded distribution is expected to offset some of savane s recent adverse trends in the declining moderate department stor e retail sector where savane has traditionally been positioned 
these programs  which began shipping in fiscal  are expected to r everse the pattern of savane s recent declines 
we also anticipate that fiscal first quarter net sales will be negatively impacte d by difficulties encountered in the consolidation of our el paso operations  particularly related to our cutting operations 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primaril y due to continued competitive pricing pressure and a higher mix of lower margin styles 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  from million  or of net sal es  for fiscal the increase in operating expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the higher relative op erating expenses associated with the duck head r and victorinox r branded components of the business 
we are currently evaluating our long term strategy with the victorinox r brand and with our retail outlet stores 
other charges 
other charges of million in fiscal relate to project synergy and include reserves for severance  lease terminations  asset write downs and other related costs 
other cha rges of million in fiscal relate to severance  in process research and development acquired in connection with the victorino x r license  costs related to closure of a sewing plant in chihuahua  mexico  and costs related to the unsuccessful pursuit of an acqui sition 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates and to a reduction of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit line during our fourth quarter 
other  net 
during fiscal  we recorded other income of million as compared with other expense of  for fiscal the change consisted primarily of lower amortization expense a nd higher royalty income offset in part by higher factor fees 
in accordance with statement no 
 we discontinued the amortization o f our intangible assets effective september  income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was 
compared with for fiscal the overall increase was due to changes in permanent items related to deferred tax asset v aluation allowances and to other transactions related to certain of our foreign entities 
this increase was offset in part by the el imination of non deductible goodwill amortization 
extraordinary item 
we recorded an extraordinary gain in fiscal of  related to the final purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisition of duck head in august net income 
as a result of the above factors  including the charges related to project synergy  we had net income of million for fiscal  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal decreased to million as compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices caused by the weak r etail environment 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  from million  or of net sales for fiscal the reduction in the gross margin was p rimarily due to a reduction in average selling prices without a comparable reduction in the average cost per unit 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  from million  or of net sale s  for fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower sales volume  coupled with incremental expenses associated with the start up of the victorinox r apparel line 
other charges 
during fiscal  we recorded pre tax charges of approximately  for severance related to a associate workforce reduction   related to design and development cost s that was acquired in connection with the victorinox r license  and  related to the closure of our sewing plant in c hihuahua  mexico 
we also incurred pre tax costs of approximately  related to the pursuit of certain assets of bugle boy industries  inc during fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of million related to severance for the former chief execut ive officer of savane 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings under o ur credit facility  and to a lesser extent  to lower interest rates 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was as c ompared with for fiscal the decrease in the effective rate is primarily the result of tax planning strategies that we implemented  which serve to reduce taxable income in various states within which we operate 
extraordinary item 
we recorded an extraordinary gain of  related to the excess of the preliminary fair value of duck head s net assets acquired over the price we paid 
the preliminary fair value estimates were subject to change  and subsequent changes were reflected as additional extraordinary gain in fiscal net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income for fis cal was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are funding our growth in operat ions and capital expenditures 
we have historically financed our growth in sales and the resulting increase in inventory and recei vables through a combination of operating cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit line 
consistent with industry practic e  we are often required to post letters of credit when placing an order with certain international manufacturers 
in june  we completed a public offering of million sh ares of common stock 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  of which approximately million was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit line the facility  to pay down a portion of our real estate loan  and to repay certain capital lease obligations 
the remaining million is being used for the payment of the cash portion of th e project synergy charges  the construction of a new administration facility in tampa  florida and for working capital and general c orporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the facility provides for borrowings of up to million  subject t o certain borrowing base limitations 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates and are secured by substantially all of our domestic assets 
as of september   there were no outstanding balances on the facility 
the facility matures in june we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain replacement financing at that time or that any available replacement fin ancing will be on terms acceptable to us 
on may   we entered into a real estate loan real estate loan agreement secured by our distribution center  cutting facility  and administrative offices in tampa  florida 
the real es tate loan was used to refinance million outstanding on our previous real estate loan and to finance up to million of the costs related to an expansion of our tampa  florida distribution facility 
in march  the real estate loan was converted to a secured term loan 
principal and interest payments were paid monthly on the refinanced amount through june on june   the terms of the real estate loan were amended and the loan now requires the payment of monthly interest only  with the remaining outstanding principal of million due on or before may  borrowings under the real estate loan bear interest at a rate of day libor plus an applicable margin at september  
under the terms of an interest rate swap agreement associated with the real estate loan  effectively million of borrowings under the real estate loan bear interest at a fixed base rate plus an applicable margin at september  
as of september   the combined effective interest rate on the real estate loan was approximately 
we have million of senior subordinated notes the notes out standing that were issued through a private placement 
under the terms of the indenture governing the notes  we are paying semi a nnual interest at the rate of through june  at which time the entire principal amount is due 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under a bridge loan that was used to finance the purchase of savane in june our credit agreements contain significant financial and operating cov enants  including prohibitions on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or to pay dividends  and restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures 
our facility and real estate loan also require that we maintain certain financial ratios  i ncluding a consolidated fixed charge ratio of at least x  a ratio of consolidated senior indebtedness to consolidated ebitda o f not more than x and a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda of not more than x 
we are currently in complia nce with all covenants under our credit agreements 
our credit agreements also contain customary events of default  inclu ding nonpayment of principal or interest  violation of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  cross defaults t o other indebtedness  bankruptcy and other insolvency events  material judgments  certain erisa events and certain changes of con trol at our company 
the occurrence of a default  an event of default or a material adverse effect on our company could result in our inability to obtain further borrowings under our facility and could also result in the acceleration of our obligations under an y or all of our credit agreements  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
during fiscal  pursuant to two separate factoring agreements  we factored substantially all our accounts receivable 
the factoring agreements provided that the factor pay us an amount equal to the gross amount of our accounts receivable from customers  reduced by certain offsets  including  among other things  dis counts  returns and a commission payable by us to the factor 
in fiscal  the commission averaged of the gross amount factored 
the factor subjected all sales to its credit review process and assumed of the credit risk for amounts factore d pursuant to the factoring agreements 
funds were transferred to reduce outstanding borrowings under the facility once paymen t was received from the factor 
the factor paid us the receivable amount upon the earlier of receipt by the factor of payment f rom our customer or ii days past the due date for such payments 
during fiscal  we intend to discontinue factoring of our r eceivables  but expect to maintain credit insurance for those accounts which we deem necessary 
we will continue to assess the adequac y of our reserves based on qualitative and quantitative measures 
as a result of the acquisition of duck head in august  cer tain consolidation and cost savings activities have transpired that will continue to impact our capital resources 
specifically  we have chosen to exit certain leased facilities 
the payment of lease termination costs will use cash 
as of september   we had exit related accruals of  we plan to complete our exit plans by december we have historically financed our capital expenditures through a combination of operating cash flow and long term borrowings 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal and prim arily related to the construction of an administration building in tampa  florida  which is expected to be completed during the second quarter ended march  and the upgrade or replacement of various other equipment and computer systems including hardware and software 
during fiscal  we anticipate capital expenditures will be app roximately million 
significant capital projects include the completion of the administration building in tampa  florida  an d the upgrade or replacement of various other equipment and computer systems including hardware and software 
during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operatio ns 
this was primarily the result of net income of million which included non cash expenses of million  a decrease in inve ntories of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million which included net cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the former duck head headquarters and distribution center  and an increase in accounts payable of million  offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in accrued expenses and other of million 
in connection with project synergy  we expect to utilize a total of a pproximately million in cash  related to payments for employee separations  employee relocation  moving costs and costs to te rminate certain operating leases 
except for the lease termination costs  these costs are expected to be paid during fiscal during fiscal  we generated million of cash from financi ng activities  principally related to net proceeds of million from the public offering of million shares of common stoc k in june net proceeds from the offering were utilized to repay certain borrowings noted above 
on september  and september   we had working capita l of million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to a million increase in cash and marketable securities  a million net increase in inventory  a million net increase in accounts receivable  and a million net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by a million net decrease in prepaid expens es and other current assets 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily related to sale of the former duck head headquarters and distribution center 
we expect that our working capital needs will continue to fluctuate based on sea sonal changes in sales  accounts receivable and trade accounts payable 
on november   we announced that william w 
compton had agreed to resign as chief executive officer  chairman and a member of the board of directors 
in connection with mr 
compton s resigna tion  we entered into a separation agreement  general release of all claims and covenant not to sue with mr 
compton 
pursuant to th is separation agreement  we paid mr 
compton severance of approximately million in cash and property in november we also accrued other related expenses of approximately million in connection with mr 
compton s resignation 
we believe that our existing working capital  borrowings available u nder our facility and internally generated funds provide sufficient resources to support current business activities 
to the extent that we seek to accelerate our growth plans  we may need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity or debt sec urities or additional credit facilities 
in addition  the factors discussed under risk factors affecting our business and prospects could significantly impact our liquidity

inflation the impact of inflation on our operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in our cost of sales 
while inflation has not had  and we do not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that ou r business will not be materially adversely affected by inflation in the future 
risk factors affecting our business and prospects our financial success is linked to the success of our customers 
our financial success is directly related to the success of our customers and the willingness of our customers  in particular our major customers  to continue buying our products 
sales to our five largest customers represented approximately  and of net sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to wal mart accounted for approximately  and of net sales during fiscal   and  respectiv ely 
sales to sam s club accounted for approximately  and of net sales during fiscal  and  respecti vely 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
sal es to our customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the c ustomer or by us 
accordingly  the number of unfilled orders at any given time is not indicative of the number that will eventuall y be shipped 
if we cannot timely fill our customers orders  our relationships with our customers may suffer  and this could ha ve a material adverse effect on us  especially if the relationship is with a major customer 
furthermore  if any of our major custo mers experiences a significant downturn in business  or fails to remain committed to our programs or brands  then these customers ma y reduce or discontinue purchases from us  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and fin ancial condition 
many of our customers are affiliates of other customers and therefore any impact to our relationship with one custom er may impact our relationship with other customers 
the apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
apparel is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the ov erall level of consumer spending 
purchases of apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with cycles in the disposabl e income of consumers 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions  increase in interest rates or any other events or uncertainties that discourage consumers from spending could have a significant effect on our sales and pr ofitability 
overall market sales declined in and and this trend continued in this decline has been due in part to declining prices 
the calendar year witnessed a significant reduction in consumer spending in the retail sector due in part to the recession in the united states and the terrorist attacks on september  such conditions may continue or may reo ccur 
in addition  moderate department stores have experienced declining sales recently  as consumers buying habits have chang ed 
this has negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  our sales  particularly our savane r branded programs 
our business could suffer as a result of consolidations  restructuring and othe r ownership changes in the retail industry 
various apparel retailers  including department stores  some of whi ch are or have been our customers  have in recent years experienced financial problems 
many have been subject to bankruptcy  restruc turing  or liquidation  while others have consolidated ownership and centralized buying decisions 
this increases our risk of ex tending credit to these retailers  and may lead us to reduce or discontinue business with such customers  or to assume more credit risk relating to their accounts receivable 
any one of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with manufacturers and retailers in the highly competitive apparel i ndustry 
we compete with many domestic and international apparel manufacturer s  including brand name and private brand producers and retailers including our own customers and vertically integrated specialty s tores who have  or may have  the internal capability to develop their products and source their products from independent manufact urers 
our products are also in competition with many designer and non designer product lines 
our products compete primarily on t he basis of price  quality  brand recognition and our ability to satisfy customer orders in a timely manner 
our failure to satis fy any one of these factors could cause our customers to purchase products from our competitors 
intense competition in the apparel industry has over the past several years resulted in and may in the future result in significant discounting and lower gross margin s 
the price deflation is attributable to increased competition  increased product sourcing to lower cost countries  growth of the mass merchant channel of distribution and increased value consciousness on the part of consumers 
this downward pressure on pr ices may limit our ability to maintain or improve gross margins 
because of our high debt level  we may also be less able to respond effectively to these developments than our competitors who have less financial leverage 
many of our competitors and potential c ompetitors have greater financial  manufacturing and distribution resources than we do 
if manufacturers or retailers increase th eir competition with us  or if our current competitors become more successful in competing with us  we could experience material adv erse effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the integration  on january   of all textile and apparel quota under the world trade organization agreement on textiles and clothing could reduce the competitiveness of apparel assembled in mexico and th e caribbean basin under our current business model 
in accordance with the agreement on textiles and clothing of the wo rld trade organization  or wto  the united states has entered into bilateral trade agreements with a number of other countries  in cluding china 
these agreements limit the amount and type of goods that may be imported annually from these countries 
as a res ult of trade preference programs with mexico and the caribbean basin  where we produce and source a majority of our goods  we curre ntly enjoy a competitive advantage over those companies who import goods from countries that are subject to these quotas 
effective j anuary   the united states  with few exceptions  is obligated to remove quotas applicable to goods from all wto member countri es  including china 
the removal of these quotas will result in an increase in the amount of goods imported annually from these countries  including china  thereby increasing our competition and potentially having a material adverse effect on our business  r esults of operations and financial condition 
we have experienced and may continue to experience delays or other difficul ties in consolidating our el paso  texas cutting and administration functions into our tampa  florida facilities 
we have experienced delays and difficulties in consolidating our el paso  texas cutting and administrative functions into our tampa  florida facilities that have resulted in delays in delivering products to our customers and lost sales in our first quarter of fiscal we may continue to experience unanticipated conditi ons  contingencies  delays and expenses in connection with the consolidation that would negatively affect our business and resul ts of operations 
as a result  we may not achieve our projected cost savings as soon as anticipated or in the amount anticipated or our costs may be more than anticipated 
additionally  any problems that we may have delivering products to our customers could dama ge our relationship with these customers and result in further lost sales or require us to discount our products to these customers to protect our business relationships 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of the fabrics or other r aw materials we use could increase our cost of sales and reduce our ability to meet our customers demands 
the principal fabrics used in our apparel consist of cotton  wool  synthetic and blended fabrics 
the price we pay for these fabrics is mostly dependent on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them  namely cotton  wool  rayon and polyester 
depending on a number of factors  including crop yields and weathe r patterns  the market price of these raw materials may fluctuate significantly 
some of our suppliers are experiencing financial difficulties 
this increases the risk that we will be unable to obtain raw materials at the price or quality or with the ease that w e have historically obtained them 
moreover  only a limited number of suppliers are available to supply the fabrics at the leve l of quality we require 
if we have to procure fabrics from sources other than our current suppliers  the quality of the fabric may be significantly different from that obtained from our current suppliers which could result in lost sales 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of the fabrics or raw materials could increase our cost of sales and reduce our ability to me et our customers demands 
we have not entered into transactions to mitigate or hedge risk relating to fluctuation in price 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass along to our customers all  or any portion of  any increases in the prices paid for the fabrics used in the manufacture of our products 
we depend upon independent manufacturers in the production of our apparel 
we use independent manufacturers to assemble or produce our product s  including the sourcing of full package imports 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the assembly or produc tion of goods ordered and to maintain manufacturing capacity 
we do not exert direct control over these independent manufact urers  however  so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
in addition  we do not have long term contra cts with any of these independent manufacturers and any of these manufacturers may unilaterally terminate their relationship with u s at any time or seek to increase the prices they charge us 
as a result  we cannot be assured of an uninterrupted supply of acceptabl e quality products from our independent manufacturers 
if there is an interruption  we may not be able to substitute suitable alterna tive manufacturers because such substitutes may not be available  or they may not be able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality  at an acceptable price or on a timely basis 
we require our independent manufacturers to meet our standards for w orking conditions  environmental protection and other matters before we are willing to place business with them 
as such  we ma y not be able to obtain the lowest cost production 
in addition  any failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws  or any divergence of any independent manufacturer s labor practices from those generally considered ethical in the united states and the potential negative publicity relating to any of these events could materially harm our business and reputati on 
our ability to successfully conduct assembly and production operations in f acilities in foreign countries depends on many factors beyond our control 
currently  more than of our products are assembled or produced by independent manufacturers in the dominican republic  mexico and central america 
the remainder of our products are produced or ass embled in other foreign countries 
it is possible that we will experience difficulties with these independent manufacturers  in cluding reduced production capacity  failure to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
also  using foreign manufacturers requires us to order products further in advance to account for transportation time 
if we overestimate customer dema nd  we may have to hold goods in inventory  and we may be unable to sell these goods at the same margins as we have in the past 
on th e other hand  if we underestimate customer demand  we may not be able to fill orders in time 
other problems we may encounter by using foreign manufacturers include  but are not limited to work stoppages  transportation delays and interruptions  delays and interruptions from natural disasters  political instability  involvement in wars or other similar conflicts such as terrorist attacks  economic disruptions  expropriation  nationalization  imposition of tariffs  imposition of import and export controls  and changes in government policies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk 
in the past  most of our contracts to have goods assembled or produced in foreign countries were negotiated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar decreases  then the price that we pay for our products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass t his increase on to our customers 
our success depends upon our ability to recruit qualified personnel and to reta in senior management 
our continued success is dependent on retaining our senior manag ement as well as attracting and retaining qualified management  administrative and operating personnel 
if we lose any members of our senior management  or if we do not recruit and retain other qualified personnel  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in november  william w 
compton  one of our founders and our chief executive officer and chairman of the board resigned 
there can be no assurance that current management can continue to m anage our business successfully without mr 
compton or that mr 
compton s departure will not cause disruptions in or otherwise negatively affect our business  customer or supplier relationships or results of operations 
we have a substantial amount of debt and interest payment requirements that wi ll require successful future operating performance and financial results and that impose important limitations on us 
we have substantial outstanding indebtedness and are highly leve raged 
the degree to which we are leveraged will have important consequences  including the following o a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  o our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capit al  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired  o our leverage may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures  o our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities may be limi ted  and o our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in relation to less leveraged competitors 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future operating performance and financial results  which will be subject in part to factors beyond our control 
although we be lieve that our cash flow will be adequate to meet our interest payments  there can be no assurance that we will generate cash flow in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges and principal payments 
if we are unable to generate cash flow in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges and principal payments and are unable to borrow funds from existing credit facilities or fro m other sources  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to sell all or a portion of our assets  e ither of which may be at terms that are unfavorable to us 
there can be no assurance that a refinancing would be possible  nor c an there be any assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that we could realize therefrom 
in addition  the te rms of the debt restrict our ability to sell assets and the use of the proceeds therefrom 
if for any reason  including a shortfall in anticipated operating ca sh flow or proceeds from asset sales  we were unable to meet our debt service obligations  we would be in default under the terms of our existing debt 
in the event of such a default  some of our lenders could elect to declare certain debt to be immediately due an d payable  including accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  such lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the debt  which consists of substantially all of our current and future personal property 
default on our senior debt obligation could result in a default under our other debt or result in bankruptcy 
the terms of our existing debt place significant restrictions on our ability to pursue financial and strategic opportunities 
our existing debt facilities contain a number of significant covena nts that  among other things  restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional debt  repay other debt  pay dividends  m ake certain investments or acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers or consolidations  engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates  and engage in certain corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that these restrictions will not adverse ly affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest  including acquisitions 
in addition  the terms of our existing debt require us to maintain compliance with certain fi nancial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these terms or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the terms of our debt and the accele ration of all or a portion of such debt  or result in bankruptcy 
our revolving credit facility matures in june and we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain replacement financing at that time or that any available replacement financing will be on t erms acceptable to us 
we are subject to changes in the apparel industry  including changing fashion t rends and consumer preferences 
the apparel industry has historically been subject to changing fashio n trends and consumer preferences 
we believe that our success is largely dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design  styling and production of our products 
if we cannot gauge consumer ne eds and fashion trends and respond appropriately  then consumers may not purchase our products and this could have a material advers e effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to successfully identify  acquire and profitably operate com panies and businesses that are compatible with our operations 
we continually evaluate the potential acquisition of other complemen tary companies and brands 
this includes our efforts to enter into new agreements to license additional brands 
our search may not y ield any complementary companies or brands  and even if we do find a suitable acquisition we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund the purchase 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of any company that we acquire into our own operations and we cannot assure you that any acquired operation will achieve the results we expected 
for example  the a cquired business may not achieve revenues  profits or operational efficiencies at the same levels as our existing operations or at the levels that it achieved prior to our acquiring it or at levels that justify the cost of the acquisition 
the success of any acq uisition will also depend upon our ability to retain or hire and then train key personnel 
acquiring another company or business may also have negative effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition because our officers and directors may f ocus their attention on completing or integrating the acquisition  or because other resources may be diverted to fulfilling the needs of the acquisition 
in addition  we may incur significant start up costs in connection with new licenses 
furthermore  we may not meet our minimum sales targets which would require us to still pay the minimum license fee as well as risk termination of the license agreement 
we compete with other companies who have greater resources than we d o for the opportunities to license brands or buy other brands  companies and businesses and to expand our operations 
as a result  even if we do identify a suitable acquisition  we may lose the acquisition to a competitor who offers a more attractive purchase pr ice 
in such event  we may incur significant costs in pursuing an acquisition or license without success 
future acquisitions c ould involve the incurrence of significant debt or the issuance of equity securities which potentially could be dilutive to our earnin gs 
our use of our trademarks and trade dress may subject us to claims of infr ingement by other parties  our trademarks and other intellectual property may not be adequately protected 
we use many trademarks in our business  some of which have been r egistered with the united states patent and trademark office 
we believe these registered and common law trademarks and other propri etary rights are important to our competitive position and to our success 
the use and registration of our trademarks and the use of our trade dress are challenged periodically 
despite our efforts to the contrary  we may violate the proprie tary rights of others 
if we were found to violate the proprietary rights of others  or any of our trademarks or trade dress were s ubjected to some other challenge  we cannot assure you that we would be permitted to continue using these trademarks or trade dress 
furthermore  if we were sued for alleged infringement of another s proprietary rights  the party claiming infringement might have g reater resources than we do to pursue its claims  and we could be forced to settle the claim on unfavorable terms or to incur substant ial costs to defend the litigation 
moreover  if the party claiming infringement prevails  we could be forced to pay significant damages  or to enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party 
pursuant to licensing agreements  we also have exclusive rights to use trademarks owned by other companies in promoting  distributing and selling their products 
we cannot assure you that these licen sing agreements will remain in effect or that they will be renewed 
in addition  any future disputes concerning these licenses may c ause us to incur significant litigation costs or force us to suspend use of the trademarks 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are impo rtant to our success and our competitive position 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our tra demarks on a worldwide basis 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our tradem arks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent limitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seek ing to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others 
in addition  the laws of certai n foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our products that are imported into the united states are subject to certain re strictions and tariffs 
most of our import operations are subject to bilateral textile agr eements between the united states and a number of other countries 
these agreements establish quotas for the amount and type of good s that can be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements allow the united states  in certain circumstance s  to impose restraints at any time on the importation of additional or new categories of merchandise 
future bilateral textile agr eements may also contain similar restraints 
excluding the countries covered under the caribbean basin trade partnership act  or cptpa  and the north america free trade agreement  or nafta  our imported products are also subject to united states customs du ties 
the united states and the countries in which we manufacture our products may adjust quotas  duties  tariffs or other res trictions that are currently in effect 
there are no assurances that any adjustments would benefit us 
these same countries may also impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions 
furthermore  the united states may bar imports of products th at are found to be made by convicts  forced indentured servants or child labor 
the united states may also withdraw the most favo red nation status of certain countries  which could result in the imposition of higher tariffs on products imported from those countries 
all of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may affect our operating results and fin ancial position 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar an d the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate  may affect the results of out international operations reported in u 
s 
dollars and the value of such operations net assets reported in us dollars 
the results of operations and financial conditi on of our businesses may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are currently sold 
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by tran slations of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into us dollars 
our management information systems are an integral part of our operations and must be updated regularly to respond to changing business needs 
we rely upon our management information systems to provide distribu tion services and to track operating results 
further modification and refinement will be required as we grow and our business needs change 
if we experience a significant system failure or if we are unable to modify our management information systems to respond to changes in our business needs  then our ability to properly and timely produce and distribute our products could be adversely affe cted 
our sales and income levels are seasonal 
our business has generally been seasonal  with higher sales and incom e in the second and third fiscal quarters 
also  some of our products  such as shorts and corduroy pants  tend to be seasonal in na ture 
if these types of seasonal products represent a greater percentage of our sales in the future  the seasonality of our sales may be increased 
this could alter the differences in sales and income levels in the second and third fiscal quarters from the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to our borrowings under the facility and the real estate loan 
as of september   interest rates on borrowings under our real estate loan were 
if the interest rates on our borrowings under our facility average basis points more in fiscal than they did in fiscal  our interest expense would increase and income before income taxes would decrease 
curr ently  there are no outstanding borrowings under our facility 
if there were outstanding borrowings under our facility  the am ount of increased interest expense would be determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on our borrowing cost without consideration for other factors such as actions management might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is intend ed to maintain the fixed variable mix of the interest rate on the real estate loan within defined parameters 
variable rates are p redominantly linked to the libor 
any differences paid or received on an interest rate swap agreement are recognized as adjustments t o interest expense over the life of each swap  thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the underlying obligation
