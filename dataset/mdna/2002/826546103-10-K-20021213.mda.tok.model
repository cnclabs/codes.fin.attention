item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sifco industries  inc and its subsidiaries engage in the production and sale of a variety of metalworking processes  services and products produced primarily to the specific design requirements of its customers 
the processes and services include forging  heat treating  coating  welding  machining and selective electrochemical finishing 
the products include forgings  machined forged parts and other machined metal parts  remanufactured component parts for turbine engines  and selective electrochemical finishing solutions and equipment 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal  net sales decreased to million from million in net loss for the year ended september  was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group the repair group  which accounted for of the company s business in fiscal  had net sales of million  down from the million level in component repair sales were down approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal demand for component repairs for virtually all models of large jet engines  especially the older model jtd engines  was down in fiscal compared to fiscal the continued retirement and reduced utilization of older generation aircraft that negatively impacted the company in fiscal was accelerated exacerbated during fiscal as a direct consequence of the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  as many airlines chose to reduce capacity by retiring many of the older aircraft in their fleets 
in addition  the impact of the terrorist attacks on the commercial airline industry in general has also resulted in the reduced demand for component repairs for the cfm general electric snecma  rb and tay both rolls royce engines due to reduced commercial flight demand  which determines the need for such repairs 
however  higher demand for component repairs for smaller jet engines and heavy industrial turbine engines partially offset the decline in demand for component repairs for the large jet engines 
revenues associated with the demand for replacement parts  which complement component repair services provided to customers  were down approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal due principally to the reduced component repair volumes in general 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million of charges related to goodwill and equipment impairments  million of restructuring charges  and a million increase in a reserve related to a vendor dispute 
the remaining million of selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal represented of net sales and reflected an million reduction in the repair group s provision for doubtful accounts  when compared to fiscal operating income loss in fiscal decreased million to an million loss from million of income in fiscal included in the decreased operating results for fiscal were charges aggregating million  million of which were incurred in the fourth quarter  related to the impairment of inventory million  the impairment of goodwill million  the impairment of equipment million  and the million of restructuring charges 
during fiscal  the repair group performed evaluations of its existing operations primarily in light of the current and anticipated impacts of the september  terrorist attacks on its business 
the principal result of these evaluation processes was the decision to optimize rationalize the repair group s multiple operations by reducing its capacity for the repair of certain components  principally related to older generation jtd turbine engines  and the repair group s decision to optimize the size of its workforce 
as a result of these decisions  the repair group recognized  during fiscal  the aforementioned charges 
in addition  the repair group increased by million  the reserve related to a vendor dispute 
the remaining million decrease in operating results during fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the negative impact on margins of the significantly reduced sales volumes for component repair services and related replacement parts 
the restructuring actions taken by the repair group in fiscal are expected to have a positive impact on fiscal operating costs when compared to fiscal the repair group will continue to evaluate the need for additional optimization rationalization of operations if and to the extent that the demand for component repair services may not recover in the future 
aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales for fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal approximately million of this decrease in net sales is attributable to a decrease in the number of ae series new generation jet engines built by rolls royce corporation for business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  as a direct consequence of reduced flight schedules  cancellation of aircraft orders  workforce reductions  and declining financial performance of the airline industry as a consequence of the september  terrorist attacks on the united states 
as a further consequence of the overall decline in the airline industry  net sales of commercial aircraft airframe components declined approximately million in fiscal  compared with fiscal net sales in fiscal were also negatively impacted by a million reduction in selling prices to the acm group s largest customer  rolls royce corporation  that was implemented during the first quarter of fiscal net sales of non aerospace related components in fiscal declined approximately million  compared with fiscal these decreases in net sales were partially offset by an approximately million net increase in shipments of military airframe and engine components in fiscal  compared with fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million 
the primary factor impacting the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal is a million charge incurred in connection with the settlement  during the second quarter of fiscal  of an employment action and a related claim that the company had filed against its insurance carrier for its failure to provide coverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses before this legal accrual was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted in fiscal by a million increase in the acm group s provision for doubtful accounts and a million increase in employee benefit expenses  offset by lower travel and other discretionary expenses 
the acm group s operating loss in fiscal was million  compared with operating income of million in fiscal the acm group s operating results in fiscal were impacted by the million legal accrual discussed above 
in fiscal  the acm group s operating income before legal accrual was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the acm group s operating results in fiscal were also negatively impacted by a million reduction in selling prices to rolls royce corporation  its largest customer  that was implemented during the first quarter of fiscal and is expected to affect future periods 
operating results were negatively impacted in by a million lifo provision  compared with a benefit in the remaining million decrease in operating income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to the negative impact on operating income of the reduced operating levels in operating results as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted in fiscal by the interplay between overall lower net sales in relation to fixed manufacturing costs 
this was offset in part by lower material cost in due to product mix consisting of a greater percentage of products made from lower cost materials than in fiscal operating results also benefited from lower utilization of outside services  such as heat treating  as in house capabilities were sufficient to support such requirements 
during fiscal  the acm group took a number of actions  including a salary freeze  cutbacks in discretionary spending and other cost containment and cost reduction actions  to mitigate  in part  the impact of significantly reduced revenues 
metal finishing group net sales were million in both fiscal and in fiscal product net sales  consisting of selective electrochemical finishing equipment and solutions  declined to million  compared with million in fiscal product net sales continued the decline that began in the first quarter of fiscal due to the overall weakness in most markets served by the metal finishing group  including aerospace  power generation  petroleum  steel  and railroad industries 
in fiscal  contract service net sales increased to million  compared with million in fiscal overall  declines in net sales to commercial customers were offset by increased sales to military customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in both fiscal and in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses benefited from lower advertising  travel and commissions expenditures  offset by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses 
the metal finishing group does not necessarily anticipate experiencing similar levels of expenditures for advertising and travel in future periods as economic conditions within the industries served by the metal finishing group improve 
the metal finishing group s operating income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal operating income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was negatively impacted by a shift in sales mix to higher contract service sales  which generate a lower margin than product sales 
additionally  a shift in the mix of contract service sales toward smaller contracts also negatively impacted operating results 
operating income in fiscal was also negatively impacted by additional fixed costs associated with a new service facility that opened in fiscal that has not reached full operating levels 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in both fiscal and corporate unallocated expenses were favorably impacted in by million of lower expenses related to management incentive and public company expenses 
during  additional staffing  employee benefit and general insurance expenses totaling million  partially offset the favorable decreases 
the decrease in management incentive expense is attributable to the financial performance of the company  while the decline in public company expenses is in part the result of the reduction in the size of the company s board of directors 
other general interest income was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the reduction in interest income is attributable to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances outstanding and lower interest rates during  compared with interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is attributable to overall lower borrowings outstanding under the company s revolving credit agreement  as well as lower interest rates 
foreign currency exchange gain was minimal in fiscal  compared with a foreign currency exchange loss of million in fiscal effective october   the company changed the functional currency of its irish subsidiary from the local currency to the us dollar 
the functional currency was changed because a substantial majority of the subsidiary s transactions are now denominated in us dollars 
other expense increased million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  as a result of a million provision recorded in to adjust the amount of the unamortized portion of deferred grant revenue for a possible future repayment obligation due to the company s recently reduced employment levels 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this provision was partially offset by an increase in the amount of nonrefundable research and other grants received during fiscal  compared with fiscal  as well as a one time gain from the sale of the acm group s interest in certain natural gas wells 
the company s fiscal income tax benefit of million consists primarily of anticipated tax refunds from the carryback of a non us operating loss 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a million valuation allowance against its net us deferred income tax assets  which were primarily recorded during the first three quarters of fiscal in assessing the company s ability to realize its net deferred tax assets  management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its net deferred tax assets may not be realized 
management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year in  net sales decreased to million from million in net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in from million  or per diluted share  in turbine component services and repair group repair group the repair group  which accounted for of the company s business in fiscal  had net sales of million  down from million in fiscal repair volumes for older model engine types continued the decline that the company experienced during fiscal as the company expected  demand for repairs to the older model jtd pratt whitney engines continue to decline due to the continued retirement and reduced utilization of older model aircraft 
in addition  there was a reduced volume of repairs to the cfm general electric snecma and rb rolls royce engines principally as a result of the increased direct involvement of the jet engine manufacturers into the repair marketplace 
however  the repair group was able to show stronger repair volumes with respect to the tay rolls royce and pw pratt whitney engines  which represent some of the group s newer programs 
revenue associated with the demand for replacement parts that complement the repair services provided to customers were also down in fiscal because of the reduced repair volumes in general 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales in fiscal during fiscal  the repair group recorded an increase in bad debt expense of million  when compared to fiscal  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in bad debt expense was partially offset by the positive impact of a weaker euro as discussed below 
operating income in fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal reduced sales volumes for repair services again adversely impacted the repair group s operating income 
during fiscal  the repair group s operating income was also negatively impacted by an increase in its reserve for obsolete replacement parts inventory of million  when compared to  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal these negative impacts were partially offset by the positive impact of improved margins on the sales of replacement parts 
lower costs in for used replacement parts that could be refurbished  resulted in improved margins on the sale of replacement parts 
however  the overwhelming contributor to the repair group s sustained operating profit  in spite of its reduced sales volumes and additional reserve provisions  has been the positive impact on the group s margins of the further weakening of the euro in relation to the us dollar during fiscal  when compared to fiscal such positive impact accounted for approximately million in operating income 
the vast majority of the repair group s us and us sales are denominated in the us dollars 
at the same time  over of the group s operations are located in ireland and the majority of its related costs are denominated in local currency that is tied directly to the euro 
consequently  as the euro declines  such costs are favorably impacted when measured and reported in equivalent us currency 
aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales for fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal the sales increase is net of a reduction in selling price of approximately million caused by a decline in the market price of a key raw material that was passed on to customers in the second half of fiscal the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of ae series new generation jet engines built by rolls royce corporation for business and regional jets  as well as transport and surveillance aircraft 
net sales in also benefited from an increase in shipments of components for military aircraft  as well as airframe components sold to commercial aircraft manufacturers 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to lower selling  general and administrative expense recognized in fiscal due to a nonrecurring reevaluation of the company s obligation to provide certain medical benefits to a small number of individuals who retired prior to the acm group s operating income in was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales in the overall higher net sales level generated million of operating income 
in addition  the group s operating income in benefited by million as a result of improved efficiencies resulting from higher production volumes 
the operating income in also benefited by million due to process improvements and million in lower tooling costs 
lifo benefit was million and million in and  respectively 
operating income as a percentage of net sales also benefited in fiscal from the decline in the market price of a key raw material in the second half of fiscal metal finishing group net sales for fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal contract service sales volumes increased million  or  representing of total sales  in fiscal when compared to fiscal solution sales increased million  or  representing of total sales  in when compared to operating income in fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal margins improved in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  due principally to product mix  both in terms of increased sales and a higher margin in the contract services area as well as a shift within solutions sales to more of a higher margin precious metal solutions 
in addition  the metal finishing group realized some production efficiencies on increased sales and fiscal had a nonrecurring charge of million related to employee benefits 
during fiscal  the metal finishing group s selling  general and administrative expenses of million were generally comparable to fiscal in amount  but represented a lower percentage of net sales 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses were million in and corporate unallocated expenses were favorably impacted by million of lower expenses related to consulting  defined contribution plan administration costs  public company expenses and actuarially determined defined benefit pension plan costs 
this was offset by million in higher management incentive expense and legal and professional expenses 
other general interest income increased to million in  compared with in  primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  offset in part by lower interest rates 
interest expense was million in  compared with million in fiscal interest expense was negatively impacted by higher average borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement  offset in part by lower interest rates 
other expense was million in fiscal  compared with other income of million in million of this change is due to foreign currency transaction losses  of which million occurred in the fourth quarter of these exchange losses result from the impact of the strengthening euro  principally in the fourth quarter of  on the carrying values of certain net monetary assets of the company s non us subsidiaries 
in addition  the amount of grant income from irish government agencies recognized by the company s irish subsidiary declined million to million in  compared with million during fiscal  us income taxes were provided on the undistributed fiscal earnings of non us subsidiaries in anticipation that distributions from such earnings  to the extent they may occur  would result in an additional income tax liability 
the company s consolidated income tax provision of million results in an effective tax rate of in  compared to in expenses not deductible for tax purposes resulted in an effective tax rate higher than the statutory rate 
the company s fiscal income tax provision of million consists of a us income tax benefit of million on a us loss of million  offset by a non us income tax provision of million on non us income of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at september  from million at september  at present  essentially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents are in the possession of its non us subsidiaries and relate to undistributed earnings 
during fiscal  the company received a distribution of million from one of its non us subsidiaries 
this distribution was utilized to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the company s revolving credit agreement 
cash flow activity for fiscal is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash was provided by a million decrease in the acm group s accounts receivable due to lower sales  net of a million increase in its allowance for doubtful accounts in response to higher levels of credit risk resulting from the current economic environment 
cash was further provided by a million decrease in the repair group s accounts receivable due to lower sales  as well as by a million decrease in the metal finishing group s accounts receivable 
acm group inventories decreased by million in fiscal  while the repair group s inventories decreased million and the metal finishing group s inventory increased million in fiscal the overall decline in inventory levels is attributable to lower sales levels experienced during fiscal the million decrease in consolidated accounts payable is attributable to lower overall operating expenses and inventory purchases due to lower net sales during fiscal the million increase in consolidated accrued liabilities is caused by a million reclassification of the unamortized portion of deferred grant revenue from other long term liabilities  the establishment of a million legal accrual and an million severance accrual in connection with staff reductions 
these increases were offset in part by payment in fiscal of million of fiscal employee incentives  million payment of fiscal income taxes  net of refunds  and lower overall operating expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal working capital was million at september   compared with million at september  the current ratio was and at september  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures consisted of equipment that will expand and diversify the repair group s repair capabilities  including hit component repair  provide other new equipment and upgrade existing equipment 
at september   the company has no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that fiscal capital expenditures will not exceed million and will be concentrated in the repair group 
at september   the company has a term note with a bank payable in quarterly installments of million through february   with the remaining balance of million due may  the term note has a variable interest rate  which after giving effect to an interest rate swap agreement with the same bank  becomes an effective fixed rate of  which is subject to adjustment based upon the level of certain financial ratios 
the outstanding balance of the term note at september  was million 
the company has at september   a million revolving credit agreement with a bank that expires on march  and bears interest at the bank s base rate 
the interest rate was at september  a commitment fee of is incurred on the remaining unused balance 
at september  the company had million available against its million revolving credit agreement 
the company also has outstanding at september   a year industrial development bond  which was issued with an original face amount of million and was used to expand the repair group s tampa  florida facility 
the interest rate is reset weekly  based on prevailing tax exempt money market rates 
interest rate at september  was 
the outstanding balance of the industrial development bond at september  was million 
under its credit agreements  the company is subject to certain customary covenants 
these include  without limitation  covenants as defined that limit the amount of annual capital expenditures and require the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  including a minimum tangible net worth level  a maximum liability to tangible net worth ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
on november  the company entered into an agreement with its bank to amend certain provisions of its credit agreements 
the amendment waives i the interest coverage ratio covenant for the periods ended september   december  and march   ii the minimum tangible net worth covenant for the period ending september   and iii the capital expenditure limitation for the period ended september  the amendment modifies certain financial covenants and the interest rate pricing grid 
as a consequence  the term note s three month libor based borrowing rate increases to effective november  also  as a result of this amendment the commitment fee on the unused balance of the revolving credit agreement was increased to 
taking into consideration the effect of this waiver  the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  the company s long term debt as a percentage of equity at september  and was and  respectively 
at september  the company had million available against its million revolving credit agreement 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  of its common shares 
the total number of shares repurchased under the company s  common share repurchase program  approved by the board of directors  is  no dividends were declared during fiscal outlook as the company noted in  its business is heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as the aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
the air transport industry s long term outlook has  for many years  been one of continued growth 
such outlook suggested the need for additional aircraft and growth in the requirement for aircraft and engine repairs 
the events of september  resulted in an immediate reduction in the demand for passenger travel both in the us and internationally 
aircraft manufacturers have announced reductions in forecasted aircraft deliveries in the next few years as a result of reduced demand  and many airlines cancelled or rescheduled deliveries of new aircraft to which they had previously committed 
in addition  the financial condition of many airlines in the us and throughout the world is weak 
the us airline industry has made requests for us government assistance  while some airlines have entered bankruptcy proceedings  and others have announced major restructuring initiatives  including significant reductions in service and grounding of aircraft 
this reduction in the demand for passenger travel and aircraft deliveries  and the increase in the number of idle aircraft  the number of which is skewed heavily toward older models  resulted in a decrease in orders and  therefore  negatively impacted the acm and repair groups net sales  operating results  and cash flows in fiscal this was due to the concentration of the acm group providing new parts for aircrafts and engines  and the repair group providing replacement parts and component repair services for the engines that power these aircraft 
declines in the commercial airline  aircraft and related engine industries have been partially offset by increases in us military spending for aircraft and related components 
the acm business supplies new and spare components for military aircraft 
increases in military component demand have partially offset the decreases in commercial aerospace component net sales 
the recent establishment of the department of homeland security may result in additional demand for military aircraft and related components 
it is difficult to determine at this time what the long term impact of these events will be on air travel and the demand for the services and products provided by the company 
these factors could result in a further decrease in orders for new and after market commercial aerospace products and services  an increase in credit risk associated with doing business with the financially troubled airlines and their suppliers  and an increase in slow moving and or obsolete replacement parts inventory related to older model engines that are experiencing reduced usage 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that that cash on hand  funds available under its revolving credit agreement and anticipated funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future

these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company provides this cautionary statement identifying important economic  political and technological factors  among others  the absence or effect of which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward looking statements and related assumptions 
such factors include the following future business environment  including capital and consumer spending  competitive factors  including the ability to replace business which may be lost due to increased direct involvement by the jet engine manufacturers in turbine component services and repair markets  successful procurement of new repair process licenses  fluctuating foreign currency primarily euro exchange rates  successful development and market introductions of new products  including an advanced coating technology and the continued development of hit repair processes  regressive pricing pressures on the company s products and services  with productivity improvements as the primary way to maintain margins  success with the further development of strategic alliances with certain turbine engine manufacturers for turbine component repair services  the long term impact on the aerospace industry of the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  including collection risks due to failure of airlines engine over haul companies and other aerospace related industries  the reduced number of aircraft in service  and the accelerated declining use of older model jet engines such as the jtd  successful replacement of declining demand for repair services for turboprop engine components with component repair services for small turbofan engines utilized in the business and regional aircraft markets  continued reliance on several major customers for revenues  as the company s five largest customers account for approximately of its total net sales  stability of government laws and regulations  including taxes  and stable governments and business conditions in economies where the company s business is conducted 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products in transactions denominated in non us dollar currencies primarily the euro  the payment in local currency  of wages and other costs related to the company s non us operations  and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company believes that inflation has not materially affected its results of operations in  and does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal foreign currency risk the us dollar is the functional currency for all of the company s us operations 
effective october   the company changed the functional currency of its irish subsidiary from the local currency to the us dollar 
the functional currency was changed because a substantial majority of the subsidiary s transactions are now denominated in us dollars 
for these operations  all gains and losses from completed currency transactions are included in income currently 
for the company s other non us subsidiaries  the functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated using average rates of exchange 
foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk by means of hedging such risk through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts 
however  such risk is mitigated only for the periods for which the company has foreign currency exchange contracts in effect  and only to the extent of the us dollar amounts of such contracts 
at september   the company had several forward exchange contracts outstanding for durations of up to nine months to purchase euros aggregating us million 
a ten percent appreciation or depreciation of the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which the forward exchange contracts outstanding at september  are denominated  would result in a million decline or increase  respectively  in the value of the forward exchange contracts 
the company will continue to evaluate its foreign currency risk  if any  and the effectiveness of using similar hedges in the future to mitigate such risk 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the variable interest rate mechanisms associated with the company s long term debt consisting of a term note payable to the company s bank  a revolving credit agreement and industrial development variable rate demand revenue bonds 
these interest rate exposures are managed in part by an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate of the term note payable to the company s bank 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from september  rates  and assuming no changes in the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement and industrial development variable rate demand revenue bonds  the additional annual interest expense to the company would be approximately million 
the company s sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates do not consider the impact of a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevail
