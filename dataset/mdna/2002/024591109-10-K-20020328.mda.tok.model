item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or from sales in sales at the tape and canadian divisions declined as a result of economic conditions 
flooring product segment sales increased due to the inclusion of a full year of sales at janus  which was acquired in october sales at congoleum declined slightly 
jewelry sales increased due to the acquisition of a line of licensed products combined with growth in sales to existing and new customers 
cost of products sold was of net sales in  up from in this increase was primarily due to decreased sales volume and competitive pricing pressures affecting results at the tape and canadian divisions 
gross profit margins also declined slightly at k m due to a lower margin mix of sales 
gross profit margins improved at congoleum due to cost reductions  efficiency improvements  and a more profitable sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  up slightly from million  or or net sales  in the increase in these expenses was primarily due to the growth at k m arising from the licensed product lines acquired from swank  inc and the inclusion of a full year of expenses at janus 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined at the tape division and canadian division but increased as a percentage of sales due to the significant sales declines at both operations 
at congoleum  selling  general and administrative expenses declined in both amount and as a percent of sales due to cost reductions initiated in the first quarter of interest income declined from million in to million in due to lower average balances of cash equivalents and short term investments earning interest at lower rates 
other income increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of a million gain on the sale of a warehouse 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher borrowings in the provision for income taxes in was of pre tax income  up from in the increase in the tax rate was primarily due to the fact that janus and congoleum  which had losses in  had lower effective tax rates than the other abi operations  which had income in as a result  the tax benefit provided for on these losses was less than the tax expense provided for on the income of the other operations 
the effect of expenses not deductible for tax purposes  which has a greater impact on the effective tax rate at lower levels of income  also contributed to the relatively high effective tax rate for net income for the year ended december  was million  down from million in income declined at the tape and canadian divisions 
janus incurred a loss in its first full year as part of abi 
the loss at congoleum was less than the loss in  which included non recurring charges for a change of distributor 
net income at k m increased 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
all of this sales decrease occurred at congoleum due to declines in sales of promotional goods and products for the manufactured housing industry 
sales increased at abi s tape and canadian divisions as well as k m 
abi acquired janus in october and its sales are included from the date of the acquisition 
cost of products sold in increased to of net sales from last year 
this increase in cost is due mainly to the results at congoleum  where margins declined due to lower sales and higher raw material and energy costs 
at abi  only nominal increases were incurred with minimal decreases incurred at k m 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately the same for both and a non recurring charge of million was recorded in for the costs of a major distributor change at congoleum  the replacement of ld brinkman co 
with mohawk industries 
there were two components to the charge 
first was congoleum s share of the costs of establishing mohawk as a distributor  which include training  meetings  displays and similar costs 
second were the costs to be paid pursuant to the settlement agreement with ld brinkman 
the provision for income taxes declined to of pre tax income in from in key among the factors reducing the effective tax rate include a reduction in abi s provision for taxes caused by congoleum s pre tax loss and lower canadian taxes due to incentives related to expansion programs 
net income for the year ended december  was million  down by million from last year s net income of million 
abi and k m were both profitable 
congoleum was not profitable 
janus was nominally unprofitable since the october acquisition date 
basic net earnings per share were in  down from in liquidity and capital resources at december   consolidated working capital was million  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  and the debt to equity ratio was to debt issued by congoleum accounts for million or of consolidated debt and is not guaranteed or otherwise secured by abi or its other subsidiaries 
net cash provided by operations during was million 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
for abi and its associated subsidiaries  capital expenditures cover normal replacement of machinery and equipment and process improvements 
in  congoleum s board of directors approved a plan to purchase up to million of congoleum s common stock 
as of december   congoleum had repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of million pursuant to this plan 
at abi  based on prior board authorizations  million is available for the purchase of abi s common stock 
in  abi s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of congoleum s common stock 
as of december   abi had purchased  shares of congoleum common stock for million pursuant to that authorization 
in july  the company  through a canadian subsidiary  entered into a credit agreement providing a million canadian dollar us million capital loan and increasing an existing operating loan facility to million canadian dollars us million 
proceeds of the capital loan were used to fund acquisitions of property and equipment in canada 
the capital loan is payable in equal quarterly installments beginning february  and bears interest at 
the operating loan is payable on demand and bears interest at a floating rate which averaged at december  in the third quarter of  abi entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement with prudential insurance company pru agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  abi borrowed million and used the proceeds to retire existing long term and revolving debt 
the new notes bear interest at reducing to if a lower ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the pru agreement  is attained 
principal is repayable in five annual million installments beginning august  in september  abi entered into a new revolving credit agreement 
this agreement provides for borrowings of up to million through september   with interest varying from libor plus to libor plus depending upon the company s leverage ratio  as defined 
in december  congoleum entered into a revolving credit facility  which expires in  that provides for borrowings up to million depending on levels of  and secured by  inventory and receivables 
certain borrowing agreements of the company or its subsidiaries restrict the ability of the company or the borrowing subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  or make capital expenditures  and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum net worth levels 
in addition  borrowings under congoleum s facility are based upon the amount of inventory and accounts receivable available as collateral 
these considerations could limit the company s ability to fully utilize the million available under its existing lines of credit 
at december   million was outstanding under these lines and million secured outstanding letters of credit 
cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  dividends and any share repurchases are expected to be financed from operating activities and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
the following table summarizes the company s obligations at december  for future principal payments on its long term debt and future minimum rental payments on its noncancellable operating leases 
payments due by period amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years years years long term debt        operating leases        contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to seven years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi  which are considered incidental to its business 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  sales returns and allowances  reserves for environmental matters and other contingencies  and the provision for income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
management has recorded both liabilities and insurance receivables in its consolidated financial statements for its estimate of future remediation activities 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company will provide for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets when it becomes more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the tax benefit underlying the asset 
in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  management makes certain assumptions as to future events such as the ability to generate future taxable income 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company primarily through its subsidiary  congoleum  is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
the company has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation and pay for related legal and loss handling costs 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from the assumptions used in developing the company s estimates 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below 
sfas no 
requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plans assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on the company s computation of pension income expense be amortized over future periods 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
in  the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments but does not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short term maturities 
substantially all of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december  consisted of indebtedness with a fixed rate of interest  which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
the company operates internationally  principally in canada  europe and the far east  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect the company s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
for foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect abi s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
under its current policies  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices
