item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its 
table of contents estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  excess component orders  cancellation costs  long term contracts  litigation  and other contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated excess and obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions 
if actual results are less favorable than those assumptions  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company holds equity investments in publicly traded japanese companies with volatile stock prices 
these companies are established market leaders in the semiconductor and electronics industries  which are highly cyclical industries and have historically experienced extended periodic downturns 
the company also maintains other investments for which the risks related to changes in market or economic conditions vary 
the company evaluates its investments for potential impairment when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value 
if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge would be recorded in current operations 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company has long term assets including property  plant  and equipment  as well as acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
these assets are susceptible to shortened estimated useful lives and changes in their fair values due to changes in their use  market or economic changes  or other events or circumstances 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long term assets based upon new events and circumstances or significant declines in the fair value of the assets 
if market conditions or other events occur which would require a significant reduction of the estimated useful lives of these assets or result in a significant decrease in fair value below their carrying amounts  an adjustment to the lives or carrying amounts would result in a charge to income in the period of determination 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
while the company has considered historical taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
additionally  the company has taken certain tax positions and is subject to audits by related tax authorities  which may result in future charges or credits 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers and third party contract manufacturers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligation would be required 
summary the company s results in were impacted by a slowdown in capital spending by manufacturers worldwide  resulting in a decrease in revenue from sales to original equipment manufacturer oem customers  who incorporate cognex machine vision systems into the capital equipment they manufacture and sell to their customers  primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries  decreased 
table of contents from likewise  sales to end user customers  who purchase cognex machine vision systems and install them directly on their production lines  decreased from the prior year 
throughout the year  the company implemented a number of cost containment measures to more closely align expenses to the lower level of customer demand  while also maintaining its commitment to new product development and end user market penetration 
the company s financial position remained strong at december   with million in total assets and million in stockholders equity 
working capital totaled million  with the majority of this balance comprised of cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross margin research  development  and engineering expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill charge for intangible asset impairment operating income loss investment and other income income loss before taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  the company operated in two reportable segments the modular vision systems division mvsd and the surface inspection systems division sisd 
mvsd designs  develops  manufactures  and markets modular vision systems that are used to control the manufacturing of discrete items by locating  identifying  inspecting  and measuring them during the manufacturing process 
sisd designs  develops  manufactures  and markets surface inspection vision systems that are used to inspect surfaces of materials that are processed in a continuous fashion to ensure there are no flaws or defects in the surfaces 
inventory and intangible asset impairment charges throughout  the company s results were negatively impacted by the worldwide slowdown in capital equipment spending by manufacturers in the semiconductor and electronics industries  as well as the weakened global economy 
during the fourth quarter of  a number of factors indicated that the business slowdown would be both longer and more severe than the company had previously anticipated  and the company s revenue plan for was lowered accordingly 
most notable among these factors were the continued decline in order rates across a variety of industries and product lines  as well as information obtained during the fourth quarter from the company s oem customers regarding their high inventory positions and low consumption rates of cognex products 
these factors indicated that the company s oem revenue would be significantly lower than expected for the next several quarters 
additionally  when a business recovery does occur  these customers will most likely transition from their current inventory of cognex legacy products to newer cognex platforms  as they leverage their engineering resources during the business slowdown to develop next generation capital equipment 
these oem product transitions  as well as the lower level of demand principally from oem customers  resulted in a  charge for excess inventories and purchase 
table of contents commitments in the fourth quarter of that is included in cost of product revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
also as a result of the significant adverse change in the business outlook determined in the fourth quarter of described above  the company evaluated the possible impairment of its intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
these analyses resulted in impairment charges based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of certain acquisition related intangible assets 
the fair value was based on discounting estimated future cash flows for assets grouped at the lowest level for which there were identifiable cash flows at a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
the resulting analyses yielded a  impairment charge related to goodwill arising primarily from the acquisitions in of the machine vision businesses of komatsu ltd 
and honeywell international inc the analyses also resulted in a  charge  included in cost of product revenue  related to the impairment of complete technology acquired primarily from komatsu ltd 
these charges impacted both the mvsd and sisd segments 
revenue total revenue for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  during  the company s results were negatively impacted by a worldwide slowdown in capital spending by manufacturers in the semiconductor and electronics industries 
sales to oem customers  most of whom make capital equipment used by manufacturers in these industries  decreased  or  from the prior year 
sales to end user customers also decreased from the prior year by  or  primarily due to lower demand from customers who make electronic products 
although end user sales decreased in total from  revenue from customers outside the semiconductor and electronics industries  such as the automotive and paper industries  increased  or  from the prior year due principally to higher sales of the company s in sight and smartview products 
both product lines were introduced in early and are targeted to the end user market

outlook the company anticipates that its results for the first quarter of will continue to be negatively impacted by the worldwide slowdown in capital spending by manufacturers in the semiconductor and electronics industries  as well as the uncertain economic conditions that exist today 
accordingly  the company anticipates that revenue for the first quarter of will be in the range of  to  compared to  reported in the fourth quarter of the company has limited visibility to revenue levels beyond the first quarter of due to the increasing level of end user business and shortened order lead times 
during  the company implemented a number of cost containment measures to more closely align expenses to the lower level of customer demand 
the company does not anticipate the savings from these measures to fully compensate for the substantial decline in revenue  and therefore  expects to report a loss in the range of to per diluted share in the first quarter of if business continues at the current order rate  it is likely that the company will report a loss in each quarter of  and therefore  for the full year as well

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment portfolio includes debt securities of various issuers  types  and maturities 
debt securities purchased with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents 

table of contents debt securities with original maturities greater than three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are categorized as available for sale 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio of debt securities at december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
as a result  the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table dollars in thousands presents hypothetical changes in fair value in the company s financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
movements in interest rates of plus or minus basis points bp and bp reflect immediate hypothetical shifts in the fair value of these investments 
fair value represents the market value of the principal plus accrued interest and dividends of certain interest rate sensitive securities at december  valuation of securities valuation of securities given an interest rate given an interest rate decrease no change increase in interest type of security bp bp rates bp bp municipal obligations with contractual maturities no greater than three years a bp move in the federal funds rate has occurred in of the last quarters 
there has not been a bp movement in the federal funds rate in any of the last quarters 
the company s investment portfolio includes equity securities in publicly traded japanese companies with volatile stock prices 
these companies are established market leaders in the semiconductor and electronics industries  which are highly cyclical industries and have historically experienced extended periodic downturns 
it is the company s intention to hold these securities on a long term basis consistent with its long term commitment to the japanese market 
equity securities are stated at fair value based upon prices quoted on public stock exchanges and are categorized as available for sale 
temporary changes in unrealized gains or losses on equity securities  net of tax  are recorded as other comprehensive income loss 
the company evaluates its investments for potential impairment when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value 
if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge would be recorded in current operations 
at december   the company s equity securities had a fair value of  and an unrealized loss of  as of march   the unrealized loss on these securities had been reduced to  the company has determined that this unrealized loss is temporary because these stock price movements represent short term trading fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and electronics industries  which the company believes are currently recovering from a downturn  and not a fundamental change in the underlying companies 
the unrealized gain loss recorded as other comprehensive income loss is made up of two components the yen strengthening weakening against the dollar and the appreciation depreciation of the stock price 
the potential change in the unrealized gain loss on the equity securities due to a hypothetical increase or decrease in either the stock price or the yen usd exchange rate would be approximately the company s investment portfolio includes an investment in a limited partnership  which is accounted for using the cost method because the company s investment is less than and the company has no influence over the partnership s operations and financial policies 
the partnership s performance is monitored by the company to determine if the cost basis of the investment has been impaired 
the company faces exposure to other financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s primary exposure has been 
table of contents related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in japan  europe  and southeast asia 
historically  the company has hedged currency exposures associated with certain intercompany payables denominated in local currencies and certain foreign currency revenue transactions 
the goal of the company s hedging activity is to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain local currency intercompany payables and foreign currency revenue transactions 
the success of this activity depends upon forecasts of transaction activity denominated in various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses
