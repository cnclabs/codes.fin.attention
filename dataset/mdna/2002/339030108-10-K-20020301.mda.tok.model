average securities decreased billion to billion due to the sale of billion of low margin securities following the summit acquisition  as well as sales of mortgage backed and other securities during average domestic loans and leases decreased billion to billion in  as a result of lower domestic commercial and residential loan volumes  commercial loan sales  securitization activity in the fourth quarter of  as well as securitization activity during the current year 
this decline was offset in part by growth in lease financing receivables 
average yields on domestic loans and leases decreased from as a result of interest rate reductions throughout average international loans and leases increased billion  with approximately half of the increase the result of continued growth in the brazilian portfolio  primarily trade related financing  and the remainder from asia  europe and other latin american countries

average interest bearing deposits decreased billion to billion in  reflecting the impact of divestitures during and the transfer of escrow deposits in connection with the sale of the mortgage banking business 
partly offsetting these decreases was an increase in money market and international deposits 
average short term borrowings decreased billion to billion during  reflecting the elimination of low yielding liabilities at the end of the first quarter of that were previously necessary to support a higher level of investment banking operations 
also contributing to the decline was a decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short term federal home loan bank borrowings 
average long term debt decreased billion to billion in  reflecting maturities of debt throughout the year  partially offset by the issuance of billion of senior medium term floating rate notes throughout the year  million of trust preferred securities in september and billion of senior fixed rate notes in november provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses for amounted to billion compared to billion for the provision included incremental provisions of million and million related to domestic problem loans and argentine loans  respectively  as well as million associated with the transfer of problem loans to accelerated disposition status 
the provision for credit losses reflects management s assessment of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses  considering the current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and economic conditions 
in  the level of provision reflected the impact of the us economic slowdown and economic and political conditions in argentina on the corporation s domestic commercial loans and argentine loans  respectively 
the amount of future provisions will continue to be a function of management s assessment of credit risk based upon its quarterly review of the reserve for credit losses  including assessments of the potential impact of a continued domestic recession and continued economic and political instability in argentina 
since the domestic economic downturn and economic volatility in argentina have continued into  management currently expects continued pressure on credit costs  although substantially less than in as such  there can be no assurance as to the level of future provisions 
additional information on the reserve for credit losses can be found in the reserve for credit losses section of this discussion and analysis and in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
noninterest income year ended december in millions banking fees and commissions    investment services revenue    credit card revenue processing related revenue capital markets revenue   gains on branch divestitures other noninterest income total noninterest income    the decline in total noninterest income from prior years primarily reflects the effect of the continued sluggishness in the us economy on fleetboston s capital markets and investment services businesses

these conditions resulted in lower stock trading volumes and caused declines in revenue 
credit card revenue credit card revenue increased million  primarily the result of higher interchange fees  reflective of greater card usage  and enhanced card issuance incentives 
this increase was partially offset by lower securitization income  the result of a reduction in the average securitization program size  lower fee income and increased charge offs  driven by a higher level of bankruptcy filings in fleetboston services approximately billion of managed securitized and owned credit card receivables 
the primary components of credit card revenue include the excess spread and servicing revenue related to the corporation s securitization activities  interchange fees and complementary product revenues  offset by amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
additional information with respect to this business unit is included in the line of business information section of this discussion and analysis 
the securitization of credit card receivables changes the corporation s status from that of a lender to that of a loan servicer 
accordingly  there is a change in the classification of the revenue associated with the securitization when reported in the income statement 
revenue over the term of the securitization may vary depending upon the credit performance of the receivables supporting the securitization  because credit losses become a component of the cash flows arising from those securitized receivables

financial condition risk management fleetboston s management of the risks inherent in its businesses is essential for financial performance and creating long term value 
risk management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the corporation s board of directors the board 
the goal of risk management is the control of fleetboston s four primary risk factors credit risk  market risk  operating risk and liquidity risk to support the prudent use of capital 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to the corporation as well as erosion of its capital and damage to its reputation 
fleetboston has a series of risk processes to identify the extent of risk involved in a business activity  to establish appropriate controls and to monitor compliance with its risk mitigation strategies 
risk management techniques are structured around certain fundamental risk principals  including commitment from senior level management  business unit ownership  clearly defined policies and procedures  training  independent oversight  established approval processes  management information systems  measurement and analytical tools  and capital allocation and performance evaluation processes 
these processes assist fleetboston in managing its risk exposures  but they cannot fully insulate the corporation from losses 
the corporation s business requires it to take risks while ensuring that it receives adequate compensation for the risks undertaken 
despite best efforts  losses will periodically occur  particularly with respect to credit risk  during the later part of the credit cycle  and with respect to other risk factors  when unanticipated events challenge the limits of risk management processes 
consequently  fleetboston continues to seek improvements to its risk management culture to better balance risks and returns while operating in a dynamic environment 
in response to the risks inherent in the financial services industry  fleetboston has organized its key areas of risk management into two control infrastructures 
management of credit risk  market risk from trading activities and operating risk is organized under the vice chairman and chief risk officer cro  who reports directly to the chairman 
management of liquidity risk  market risk from non trading activities  and capital is organized under the corporation s treasurer  who reports directly to the vice chairman and chief financial officer cfo 
the risk management group under the cro also has administrative oversight for fleetboston s global assurance functions  audit  corporate compliance and risk review  which monitor credit risk rating integrity and compliance with regulatory requirements and various operating risk policies 
fleetboston uses a series of cross functional committees to provide oversight of its risk management processes  including the credit policy committee cpc  the market risk committee  the loan loss reserve committee  the country exposure committee  the consumer risk committee and the operating risk committee  which are chaired by the cro or various senior executives within the risk management group as appointed by the cro 
there is also a portfolio management committee  which is co chaired by the cro and the vice chairman for wholesale banking 
the asset  liability and capital committee alcco  which provides specific oversight for the management of market risk  liquidity risk and capital  is chaired by the treasurer and includes as members various vice chairmen  including the cfo and representatives of major business lines 
alcco sets strategic directives that guide the day to day market risk management activities of the corporation  and also reviews and approves all major market risk  liquidity risk and capital management programs 
additional information on certain of fleetboston s risk management processes and certain of the above mentioned committees is included in the credit risk management  country risk  liquidity risk management  market risk management and operating risk management sections of this discussion and analysis 
credit risk management credit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from a counterparty s failure or inability to meet payment or performance terms of a contract with the corporation 
the corporation s credit risk management processes are intended to address the management of all forms of credit risk  including balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
the cpc governs the credit risk process of the corporation by establishing all credit policies  approving underwriting standards and concentration limits  and granting credit approval authorities 
the processes are intended to ensure that risks are accurately assessed  properly approved  and continuously monitored 
an independent credit function monitors compliance by individual units with fleetboston s credit policies  works to ensure that credit due diligence and credit administration meet acceptable standards  and is responsible for the effectiveness of the loan review process 
the credit function includes a staff of credit officers reporting directly to the chief credit officer cco 
these credit officers are assigned to work with the various business units to ensure that each individual credit exposure is appropriately risk rated  and monitor and manage credit risks within policy and portfolio guidelines 
in addition  a credit information unit provides reports on credit exposures on a corporatewide basis 
a risk review unit  which reports independently of both the business and credit units  audits the integrity of risk ratings and the adequacy of the credit process for all units of fleetboston 
senior management in boston oversees the world wide credit activities  both corporate and consumer  of the corporation 
the level of management required to approve credit exposures varies according to the size and level of perceived risk 
portfolio limits and underwriting standards are established by the cpc for both commercial and consumer credit exposures with common risk characteristics  such as industry or product type 
an important aspect of fleetboston s portfolio management process is the management of large  individual credits  which are governed by relationship limits that are set according to risk rating 
the cpc also establishes target risk rating profiles for the corporation 
all limits are reviewed regularly and adjusted based on the cpc s assessment of relevant conditions 
in addition  the country exposure committee  chaired by the cco  sets country limits on cross border exposures to borrowers and counterparties domiciled in other countries 
these limits are more fully discussed in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis 
the corporation s loan syndications unit  which is part of wholesale banking  plays an integral role in portfolio management by enhancing the liquidity of the wholesale loan portfolio 
this unit  which is responsible for arranging participations in loans where the corporation is the lead bank  maintains contact with other institutional lenders and investors in bank structured loans  maintains information on credit structure and pricing by risk category  evaluates the market liquidity of facilities  and syndicates fleetboston agented facilities to attain desired hold levels 
fleetboston employs a corporate wide process to review individual credits and identify emerging problems 
credits that deteriorate into certain defined risk categories are managed by a separate managed asset unit composed of professional asset recovery specialists who establish detailed asset management plans designed to mitigate risk of credit loss to the corporation 
consumer credit risk management uses sophisticated portfolio modeling  credit scoring and decision support tools to project credit risk and therefore to establish underwriting standards 
consumer portfolios are monitored closely to identify deviations from expected performance and shifts in consumers patterns of behavior

international commercial loans increased billion  partly due to continued growth in the brazilian portfolio  mainly trade related financing  as well as growth in asia  europe and other latin american countries 
domestic c i borrowers consist primarily of middle market and large corporate customers  and are well diversified as to industry and companies within each industry 
international commercial borrowers are primarily concentrated in the energy production  telecommunications  agriculture production and services and transportation industries

approximately of the domestic portfolio at december  consisted of loans secured by residential real estate  including first and second mortgages  home equity loans and home equity lines of credit 
the billion increase in home equity loans from the prior year resulted primarily from a home equity loan promotion during the fourth quarter of  offset  in part  by a million securitization transaction completed in the second quarter of the year 
domestic residential real estate loans  secured by one to four family properties  decreased billion to billion at december  this decline was primarily the result of loan runoff and lower business volume in a refinancing environment 
domestic credit card loans increased million to billion at december  the increase was mainly the result of growth in owned receivables and activity related to prior year securitizations  offset  in part  by billion of new securitizations during consumer margin loans decreased billion from december   with the decrease due to lower margin lending at quick reilly  as adverse market conditions impacted the demand for such loans 
the aggregate decreases in the remaining domestic consumer loan categories were attributable to loan runoff 
lease financing fleetboston is engaged in lease financing on both a domestic and international basis 
domestic lease financing totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  this million  or  increase was primarily attributable to new business growth 
country risk non us operations fleetboston s overseas activities are subject to economic and political conditions related to  and economic and regulatory policies of  the governments and the countries in which the activities are conducted  including the policies of such governments toward indebtedness to foreign lenders 
in addition  local and regional economic conditions affect local economies and governments in varying degrees of severity and  accordingly  may also affect fleetboston s latin american and other overseas activities 
in broad terms  the total assets of the corporation s overseas operations are subject to a number of risks collectively referred to as country risk 
country risk includes the following the possibility of deteriorating economic conditions political and social upheaval nationalization and expropriation of assets exchange controls restrictions on the remittance of funds transfer or cross border risk currency depreciation or devaluation fleetboston manages its overall country risk using limits established by the country exposure committee 
within these limits  sublimits are established for the following cross border risk nontrade related lending transactions with long term tenors sovereign government exposure assets for which a third party accepts transfer risk in establishing these limits  the corporation considers the economic and political situation of individual countries using both internal and external analyses 
the country exposure committee reviews these limits at least annually 
cross border outstandings  which are included in the total assets of the corporation s overseas operations  are subject to transfer  or cross border  risk in addition to credit risk 
cross border outstandings include claims on third parties  as well as investments in  and funding of  the corporation s overseas operations 
cross border risk is the risk that customers will be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations as a result of actions taken by foreign governments  such as exchange controls  debt moratoria and restrictions on the remittance of funds 
cross border outstandings to argentina and brazil each amounted to or more of fleetboston s consolidated total assets at december   and there were no cross border outstandings to other countries which exceeded 
of consolidated total assets at december   and the sections that follow discuss the corporation s argentine and brazilian operations in detail 
included is a discussion of the total assets of each operation  as well as the cross border outstandings included in those assets 
argentina argentine government measures since  argentina has been impacted by a severe recession that has caused continued economic and political instability  as well as significant volatility in its financial markets 
this situation culminated in december with the resignation of the president and an ongoing series of new economic measures and governments 
the argentine government continues to announce new measures to manage the country s financial situation 
some of the more significant measures include the elimination of the argentine peso s one to one link to the us dollar and the allowance of the peso to float against the us dollar the conversion of certain us dollar loans into pesos at a one to one exchange rate and the conversion of all us dollar deposits into pesos at an exchange rate of pesos to one us dollar the announcement by the argentine government that it will provide compensation to the banking system for the mismatch between converting loans and deposits into pesos at different exchange rates the requirement that deposits be repaid based on an extended repayment schedule  as well as restrictions on the amount that depositors can withdraw from their account the implementation of restrictions on the transfer of us dollars outside of argentina the discussion that follows considers the impact of these measures on fleetboston s argentine operations and actions taken by fleetboston 
the corporation operates branches in argentina with total assets of approximately billion at december  these assets are subject to the country risk described above 
the overall composition of these assets is summarized as follows in billions loans placements with central bank and other banks securities

total loans approximately two thirds of the consumer loans are secured  primarily by residential mortgages with an average loan to value ratio of approximately 
corporate loans include loans to subsidiaries of us and european multinationals  and to large argentine corporations 
sovereign loans and related exposures include provincial loans and federal government obligations acquired in the fourth quarter argentine government bond swap  which were reclassified from securities 
the corporation has billion on deposit with the argentine central bank to meet statutory reserve requirements related to the corporation s argentine operation s billion of local deposits 
the corporation is required by local regulations to place the required reserves with the central bank based on a fixed percentage of each deposit received 
local deposits and intercompany borrowings are the primary funding sources for the corporation s argentine operation s balance sheet 
the securities portfolio of million is after the government bond swap discussed in the actions portion of this section 
all of these securities are obligations due from the argentine government  and include million  that mature in april  to meet reserve requirements 
the argentine government s recent actions led to the conversion of the majority of the assets presented in the preceding table and of all deposits from us dollars into pesos 
since the assets and deposits are converted into pesos  the amount reported in us dollars will decrease as the peso devalues against the us dollar 
of the billion of loans  billion represent us dollar assets that will not be converted 
the argentine government s measures may significantly impact fleetboston s interest rate and liquidity risk related to the balance sheet recorded in its argentine operations 
to date  there is not sufficient information to fully analyze the potential liquidity and interest rate risk 
fleetboston will continue to monitor the impact such measures will have on these risks

the billion of cross border outstandings at december  have the following cross border risk mitigation 
billion are covered by insurance contracts 
the insurance coverage is purchased from us and foreign government  multilateral and private insurers 
this coverage protects the corporation from non payment due to the inability of the customer to transfer funds or convert the necessary funds into the obligation currency due to government actions 
the corporation is required to follow specific procedures if a cross border event occurs  including timely notification of such an event to the insurer 

billion are loans with guarantees that cover credit and cross border risk 
in addition  there is another billion of trade related outstandings  which historically have received preferential treatment in cross border risk events

aggregate outstandings at december  the argentine government enacted exchange controls in december that limited the transfer of funds outside of that country 
these regulations continue to be modified 
as of december   fleetboston s cross border outstandings were not significantly impacted by these regulations 
however  it is expected that over time such regulations may result in the delay of the transfer of dollars outside of argentina 
the corporation is unable to determine at the present time the ultimate impact such measures will have on its cross border outstandings 
argentine mutual funds the corporation s argentine operation managed approximately million of mutual funds  composed of million invested in bank deposits and million invested in government securities  at december  the argentine government s measures  announced subsequent to december   which restricted withdrawals of bank deposits  also applied to mutual fund redemptions 
therefore  mutual fund investors currently cannot receive redemptions of their funds 
argentine currency position periodically  fleetboston establishes currency positions in certain countries with the intention of taking advantage of expected movements in currency exchange rates and or interest rates 
currency positions expose fleetboston to gains or losses that depend on the relationship between currency price movements and interest rate differentials 
the following table presents the argentine currency position  which was a long dollar position of million at december  however  this position was significantly impacted by the argentine government s conversion of us dollar assets and deposits into pesos 
based on the information available  the impact of these measures resulted in a net peso position of approximately million 
at year end daily average in millions argentina a b a positive value reflects us dollar assets exceeding funding from local currency liabilities ie  long position in ie dollars 
b negative values reflect local currency assets exceeding funding from us dollars us  short positions in us dollars 
the change in the country s financial system from us dollars to pesos is expected to result in a change in the functional currency of the argentine unit from the us dollar to the peso  as required by sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
therefore  it is expected that the majority of any future exchange rate impact would be recorded in comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
it is not expected that the transition adjustment related to the conversion to the peso as the functional currency will significantly impact the corporation s total stockholders equity 
the remaining currency position after the conversion to the peso as the functional currency is not expected to significantly impact the corporation s results of operations 
actions as mentioned  the argentine government enacted and announced certain measures subsequent to december  these measures have increased the corporation s credit  cross border  market  liquidity and operating risks related to its billion of argentine assets 
in response to these measures  which continue to be subject to change  the corporation utilized the information available at the time to record certain charges incurred to address the increase in risks as of december  a charge of million related to the estimated impact of the argentine government s actions on the corporation s argentine balance sheet was recorded 
this charge considered a number of issues the conversion of loans  other earning assets and deposit liabilities into pesos  the change in the corporation s market risk position due to a change in the net peso position after the conversion of loans and deposits  and operational and legal issues resulting from the implementation of the measures 
the corporation increased its reserve for credit losses related to argentine loans by million due to concerns that the argentine government s actions and ongoing recession may impact customers ability to service their existing obligations 
the argentine government s actions may lead to delays in customer debt service for loans made by fleetboston in that country  as well as those loans that are part of the corporation s aggregate argentine cross border outstandings 
the impact of the government actions on the corporation s argentine loans may lead to a substantial increase in argentine npas from the december  level of million  as well as higher credit losses 
a charge of million was recorded against the corporation s argentine government bond portfolio 
this included million for the securities swapped by the corporation in the fourth quarter of as part of the argentine government s local bond swap 
the corporation swapped approximately million of argentine government securities for loans 
the resulting loans pay an interest rate of approximately and extend the principal maturity of the portion of the swapped debt due before by three years 
the corporation continues to monitor and evaluate the argentine economic measures discussed above  and will adjust its strategy as deemed appropriate 
however  in light of the changing economic measures and continuing economic  political and social uncertainty in the country  it is not possible to predict the impact that future developments may have on that country s economic growth  or on the corporation s operations in argentina

billion are covered by insurance contracts see discussion in argentine section for more information 
billion is related to transfer risk mitigation  all of which is trade related and included in the billion of trade related claims in the table above 
the cross border risk mitigation is designed so that payment of these claims and intercompany funding is made outside of brazil by third parties in the event of a cross border risk event 
the repayment is tied to trade transactions authorized and approved by the brazilian central bank 
in order to maintain the cross border risk protection  it is necessary that the brazilian export markets remain open 
billion of assets are funded by third party liabilities where the provider assumes the transfer risk  these funds are typically raised from correspondent banks 
in these cases  the provider of funds assumes the risk of nonpayment  if at the time a payment is due on the funding a cross border risk event occurs due to government action 
the provider of funds is contractually bound to either accept local currency in repayment or wait until the event ceases to exist to receive payment 
billion are loans with guarantees that cover credit and cross border risk 
the guarantees include a combination of guarantees from non brazilian domiciled companies  funded participations and other third party guarantees 
the third party funding and guarantees may require the corporation to perform certain processes to ensure its coverage under the various cross border risk mitigation products 
in addition to the trade related amount above  there is another billion of trade related outstandings  which historically have received preferential treatment in cross border risk events

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npas are assets on which income recognition has ceased or is limited

additional information on argentine npas is included in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis 
reserve for credit losses the reserve for credit losses represents the amount available for credit losses which management determines is inherent in the corporation s loan and lease portfolios of the balance sheet date 
loans are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible  after giving consideration to factors such as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  as well as general and industry economic conditions 
fleetboston performs periodic  systematic reviews of its portfolios to identify inherent losses and assess the overall probability of collection 
these reviews result in the identification and quantification of loss factors  which are used in determining the amount of the reserve for credit losses 
in addition  fleetboston periodically evaluates prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  including emerging markets risks and cross border outstandings  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio and other pertinent factors 
portions of the reserve for credit losses are allocated to cover the probable losses inherent in each loan and lease category based on the results of this detailed review process 
commercial loans and leases and their related unfunded commitments to lend are individually reviewed and assigned a credit risk rating from low risk of loss to high risk of loss 
loans with a credit risk rating of and above and a principal balance greater than  are individually reviewed to determine the need for a specific loan loss allocation 
additionally  derived or calculated loan loss allocations are provided for loans not specifically reviewed 
probable loss factors are provided using actual fleetboston default and loss history for loans with a credit risk rating of to based on their specific credit risk rating classification 
the combination of these analyses is the basis for the determination of the commercial loan and lease portions of the reserve for credit losses 
consumer loans  which include credit cards  residential mortgages  home equity loans lines  direct indirect loans  consumer finance and international consumer loans  are generally evaluated for credit risk as a group based on product type 
the determination of the consumer loan portion of the reserve for credit losses is based on one year of forecasted net credit losses 
this forecast is determined using several modeling tools  including a delinquency roll rate model  a vintage model and a regression model 
credit risk for small business loans is analyzed in a similar manner but a risk rating migration analysis  rather than delinquency and one year of forecasted net losses  acts as the base for the reserve 
the results of the analyses are reviewed and discussed by fleetboston s loan loss reserve committee  the respective lines of business and the collections group 
a sovereign risk analysis  which assesses the cross border risk of credit loss  is performed as part of the corporation s review of its international commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
testing of forecasted net credit losses and specific allocations of the reserve are performed on a quarterly basis 
as a result  adjustments to reserve allocations for specific segments of the loan and lease portfolio may be made  based on the accuracy of forecasted net credit losses and other credit or policy related issues 
the process used by fleetboston to determine the appropriate overall reserve for credit losses is based on this analysis  taking into consideration management s judgment 
this reserving methodology is reviewed on a periodic basis and modified as appropriate 
based on this analysis  including the aforementioned assumptions  management believes that the reserve for credit losses is adequate as of december  an integral component of fleetboston s risk management process is allocating the reserve for credit losses based upon risk characteristics  demonstrated losses  loan segmentations  and other factors 
the unallocated component of the reserve for credit losses represents management s view that  given the complexities of the loan portfolio  there are probable losses that have been incurred but not yet specifically identified 
this unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions utilized in the allocated reserve calculation 
at december   the corporation s allocated reserve for credit losses amounted to of the total reserve for credit losses

at december  liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from fleetboston s inability to meet known near term and projected long term funding commitments 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the ability of fleetboston and its subsidiaries to meet their financial obligations 
these obligations are the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the payment of lease obligations as they become due  the ability to fund new and existing loan and other funding commitments  and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
alcco is responsible for implementing the policies and guidelines of the board governing liquidity 
us dollar liquidity management is centralized in the corporation s treasury unit in boston  with overseas operations managing their own local currency liquidity requirements 
liquidity is achieved by the maintenance of a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell marketable securities  and access to capital markets 
liquidity may also be enhanced through the securitization of commercial and consumer receivables  discussed in more detail below 
liquidity is measured and monitored daily  allowing management to better understand and react to balance sheet trends 
on a monthly basis  a comprehensive liquidity analysis is reviewed by alcco 
the analysis provides a summary of the current liquidity measurements  projections and future liquidity positions given various levels of liquidity stress 
management also maintains a detailed liquidity contingency plan designed to respond to an overall decline in the condition of the banking industry or a problem specific to fleetboston 
the primary sources of liquidity for the parent company are interest and dividends from subsidiaries  access to the money and debt capital markets and short term liquid assets 
dividends from banking subsidiaries are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and retained earnings 
at december   the parent company had commercial paper outstanding of million  compared with billion at december  the parent company had short term liquid assets of billion at december  and billion at december  short term liquid assets include deposits placed by the parent company with its banking subsidiaries 
during the previous two years  the parent company had backup lines of credit totaling billion to ensure that funding was not interrupted if commercial paper was not available 
at december  and  there were no outstanding balances under these lines of credit 
in  the parent company took specific steps to enhance its liquidity profile by adopting a policy to maintain short term assets at an amount sufficient to meet payment of its short and long term debt maturities and net cash operating shortfall over a month period 
in conjunction with this new liquidity policy  these backup lines of credit were cancelled effective january  the parent company had billion available for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or trust preferred securities  senior or subordinated securities and other debt securities at december  under an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
availability under this shelf was billion at february  fleetboston has established a number of statutory business trusts  the sole purpose of which is to issue trust preferred securities and invest the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures issued by the parent company 
the parent company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each trust s obligations under the trust securities 
the trusts are included in fleetboston s consolidated financial statements  and the trust securities are included in long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
additional information concerning these trust preferred securities is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
the primary sources of liquidity for fleetboston s banking subsidiaries are cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings and short term high quality liquid assets 
non banking subsidiaries rely primarily on cash flows from operations  short term liquid assets and funds from the parent company 
liquidity at the bank level is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  core deposits and wholesale funds 
diversification of liquidity sources by maturity  market  product and funds provider are mandated through alcco guidelines 
the strength of the banking subsidiaries liquidity position is their base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources in the capital markets  as well as from direct customer contacts 
wholesale funding sources include large certificates of deposit  foreign branch deposits  federal funds  collateralized borrowings and a billion bank note program 
another important source of bank funding is the securitization market 
during  approximately million of home equity loans and billion of credit card receivables were securitized 
generally  in a securitization  fleetboston transfers financial assets  such as commercial loans  credit card receivables or home equity receivables  to qualifying special purpose entities qspes which are legally isolated from the corporation 
the qspes  in turn  sell securities to investors which entitle them to receive specified cash flows during the term of the security 
the proceeds from the issuance of securities are then distributed by the qspes to the corporation as consideration for the loans transferred 
at december   the qspes held aggregate assets of approximately billion  composed of approximately billion of credit card receivables  billion of commercial loans and million of home equity loans 
the assets and liabilities of the qspes  other than the retained interests described below  are not included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
fleetboston has retained interests in the securitizations  which provide credit enhancements to the investors 
these retained interests include residual positions such as interest only strips  which totaled approximately million at december   and other retained interests  including subordinated debt securities  overcollateralization positions and cash collateral accounts  which totaled approximately million at december  the retained interests  which are included in fleetboston s consolidated balance sheet  represent the corporation s maximum risk exposure associated with these transactions 
investors in the securities have no further recourse against the corporation if cash flows generated by the securitized assets are inadequate to service the obligations of the qspes 
additional information concerning securitization transactions is included in the noninterest income section of this discussion and analysis and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
in  fleetboston sold troubled commercial loans with a recorded investment of approximately million  as well as related funding commitments of approximately million  to a special purpose entity spe established by a third party  and received approximately million in cash and million in a subordinated note 
the sale did not result in any significant gain or loss to fleetboston 
as a result of the sale  the reserve for credit losses was reduced by approximately million 
fleetboston does not hold an equity interest in the spe  nor does it manage the assets in the spe 
in addition  fleetboston does not guarantee any of the debt securities or equity interests issued by the spe to third parties 
fleetboston s exposure is limited to its investment in the subordinated note  which is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the following table presents information related to fleetboston s funding sources for the last two years 
components of funding sources december in millions deposits domestic demand   regular savings and now   money market   time   international   total deposits   short term borrowings federal funds purchased   securities sold under agreements to repurchase   commercial paper   other   total short term borrowings   due to brokers dealers   long term debt   total   certificates of deposit and other time deposits issued by domestic offices in amounts of  or more as of december  will mature as presented in the following table

contractual cash obligations payments due by period in millions total under year years years after years long term debt a      operating leases b  total contractual cash obligations      a includes capital lease obligations 
b represents minimum annual rental commitments exclusive of taxes and other charges 
certain operating leases contain escalation clauses  which correspond with increased real estate taxes and other operating expenses  and renewal options calling for increased rents as the leases are renewed 
no restrictions are imposed by any lease agreement regarding the payment of dividends  additional debt financing  or entering into further lease agreements 
additional information concerning these obligations is included in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
the following table presents the corporation s other commercial commitments at december  these commitments are not included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period in millions total committed under year years years after years commitments to extend credit  including backup liquidity lines  letters of credit  financial guarantees and foreign office guarantees net of participations    other commercial commitments  n a n a n a n a total commercial commitments      n a not applicable commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers in accordance with contractual provisions 
these commitments usually are for specific periods or contain termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee 
the total amounts of unused commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are agreements whereby the corporation guarantees the performance of a customer to a third party 
collateral may be required to support letters of credit in accordance with management s evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer 
the credit exposure assumed in issuing letters of credit is essentially equal to that in other lending activities 
management does not anticipate any significant losses as a result of these transactions 
financial guarantees include the guarantee of million of medium term debt  due in and  of a former subsidiary of fleetboston  which it sold in other commercial commitments represent unfunded commitments of the corporation s principal investing business 
such commitments relate to fund investments and are drawn down periodically throughout the life of the fund 
fleetboston is also exposed to liquidity risk as a provider of financial services to its corporate customers by its corporate banking business unit 
the corporation provides access to liquidity to such customers through asset backed commercial paper programs 
these programs utilize spes which  at the request  or on behalf  of customers  may purchase financial assets directly from those customers or from third parties  or make loans secured by the financial assets of customers 
the spes finance this activity through the issuance of rated commercial paper to third party investors 
fleetboston does not sell its own assets to these spes  and the assets and obligations of the spes are not included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
the corporation receives fees for structuring financial transactions for its customers and for the provision of administrative services to the programs 
in  total aggregate structuring and administrative fees received by fleetboston related to the commercial paper programs totaled approximately million 
at december   these spes had aggregate assets of approximately billion  primarily loans and debt securities  and aggregate liabilities outstanding  composed of commercial paper  of billion 
the assets of the spes are generally of investment grade quality and are typically secured by other financial assets  such as leases  trade receivables or cash held as collateral 
based on commitments of the spes to their customers at december   the spes could be required to provide additional funding totaling billion 
the commercial paper outstandings and commitments of the spes to provide additional funding are supported by backup liquidity lines of credit and credit derivative contracts provided by fleetboston and third parties 
backup liquidity lines provided by fleetboston totaled billion at december   and are included in the preceding commercial commitments table 
no amounts were drawn under these liquidity lines 
the notional amount of credit derivative contracts provided by fleetboston totaled billion at december  to mitigate risk  fleetboston has entered into offsetting credit derivative contracts with third parties 
in addition  fleetboston provides direct credit support to one of the spes by issuing financial standby letters of credit  which totaled approximately million at december  these letters of credit are included in the preceding commercial commitments table 
the overall potential impact of the risk to liquidity of these commercial paper programs is included in the monthly liquidity analysis more fully discussed earlier in this section 
fleetboston also provides administrative services  including asset management services  to spes unrelated to those utilized by the commercial paper programs  on behalf of third parties 
the corporation generally does not sell its own assets to the asset management spes  nor does it guarantee the obligations or otherwise provide credit enhancements to them 
fleetboston provides backup liquidity lines  which totaled million at december   to two of these spes 
at december   no amounts were drawn under these liquidity lines 
the assets and liabilities of the asset management spes are not included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
material risks to the sources of short term liquidity would include  among other things  rating agency downgrades of the corporation s deposits and debt securities below investment grade  and unanticipated funding requirements  such as guarantees of third party debt 
as of december   there were no circumstances that management considered reasonably likely to occur that would affect the corporation s sources of short term liquidity 
based upon fleetboston s level of excess funds and its ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including its ability to issue debt and equity securities under its current shelf registration  management considers overall liquidity at december  sufficient to meet the corporation s current obligations to customers and debt holders  support expectations for future changes in asset and liability levels and carry on normal operations 
market risk management market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income and capital to variations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
fleetboston is exposed to market risk both in its trading activities and in its non trading  or balance sheet management  activities 
the market risk management processes for these activities applies to both balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
additional information concerning the equity price risk associated with the corporation s principal investing portfolio is included in the capital markets revenue section of this discussion and analysis 
trading activities fleetboston s market risk management process for its trading activities applies to all forms of price risk  or the risk of loss in earnings arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instrument trading portfolios 
the board approves policies concerning the corporation s tolerance for these risks  and alcco issues overall strategic direction to specify the extent to which the corporation can utilize any of the board approved limits 
the market risk committee mrc  chaired by the executive director  market risk management  allocates the overall risk limits for trading portfolios to individual lines of business 
senior management from these lines of business evaluate risk taking activities  and ensure that actual exposures remain consistent with approved policies and limits 
market risk management provides an independent view of the identification  measurement  monitoring and control of price risk in trading activities 
market risk management has a group of risk managers that develop specialized expertise and in depth knowledge of fleetboston s trading lines of business  and work with business managers to set policies that reflect an appropriate framework for risk measurement  risk monitoring and reporting processes  and risk control structures 
these risk managers ensure compliance with established policies and risk limit structures on a daily basis  and evaluate relevant market conditions and business initiatives as part of the monitoring process 
as warranted  the risk managers review and assess proposals to alter the existing risk profile through both new products and services or significant modifications to existing products and services  thereby ensuring that the appropriate risk management oversight and infrastructure exists prior to commencement of the activity 
in addition  market risk management has a capital markets analytics group that develops market risk measurement methodologies and models  estimates risk factors and gathers dynamic market data for use within these models  analyzes statistical properties of market data for estimation of the risk factors  and conducts all model validations that include ascertaining model appropriateness and testing actual model performance 
both of market risk management s above described groups rely on a separate risk information department that provides reports on trading exposures on a corporate wide basis 
fleetboston s exposure to price risk arises in the normal course of its business as a financial intermediary 
fleetboston enters into interest rate  currency exchange and precious metals contracts primarily to satisfy the investment and risk management needs of its customers 
equity positions result mainly from the corporation s market making and underwriting activities 
in addition  fleetboston takes certain proprietary trading positions  including positions in high yield and emerging markets fixed income securities  local currency debt and equity securities  and related derivatives instruments 
the corporation expects these positions to benefit from short term movements in the prices of securities and from perceived inefficiencies among the prices of various securities issued by the same country or entity 
domestic fixed income trading activities also include position taking in us treasury and us government agency securities 
fleetboston evaluates the overall profitability of its trading positions by measuring the daily change in the mark to market value of these portfolios  including other related revenues 
the following histogram presents the distribution of aggregate daily trading related revenues  in millions of dollars  that resulted from the corporation s combined trading activities during trading related revenues include trading profits and commissions  foreign exchange revenue and market making revenue  which are all components of capital markets revenue  as well as net interest income from these trading positions 

pagejpg 
market conditions throughout posed significant and ongoing challenges for the corporation s trading businesses and risk management processes 
at times  market volatility increased dramatically in a variety of sectors  including domestic equities  currency exchange and emerging markets securities 
as shown in the chart above  the corporation s risk management discipline effectively controlled the size and extent of negative trading results 
to measure the overall price risk inherent in its trading activities  the corporation uses a value at risk var methodology  based on industry standard risk measurement techniques 
the system draws on historical and current market data to estimate potential market volatility  and measures the risk to earnings at a confidence level  which means that the corporation expects daily results to exceed the potential loss as calculated by var only occasionally ie  no more than one time for at least trading days 
the var methodology includes holding periods for each position based upon an assessment of relative trading market liquidity for each instrument  and a conservative view of cross product correlations that does not reflect the full diversification benefits of positions taken across different trading businesses 
in light of the diverse set of trading conditions during  fleetboston actively enhanced its processes for price risk measurement and monitoring against approved limits 
the table below presents the corporation s exposure with respect to its combined trading portfolios value at risk var in millions average high low year ended december  year ended december  at december  total var usage measured million 
in no instance did the corporation s daily var measure exceed the mrc s approved limit 
the following table summarizes fleetboston s aggregate average var by risk type for the periods presented 
average var for commodity risk remained insignificant for the periods shown 
var by risk type in millions average average interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange risk aggregate price risk during  most of the price risk in fleetboston s trading activities arose from interest rate risk  which includes directional and spread components 
interest rate risk arises primarily from trading activity in various domestic fixed income markets  the argentine and brazilian sovereign and high end corporate bond markets  and some exposure to fixed income markets in the asia pacific region 
the contribution to the corporation s var from equity trading activities during declined significantly  as most equity oriented lines of business reduced their positions 
the individual activities that generate most of these risks include fleetboston s large nyse specialist firm  nasdaq market making  and a convertible bond trading and underwriting business 
the majority of foreign exchange risk arises from fleetboston s argentine and brazilian operations  which establish currency positions with the intention of taking advantage of expected movements in currency exchange rates and or interest rates 
additional information concerning these currency positions is included in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis 
the corporation s independent market risk management function routinely validates the corporation s measurement framework by conducting backtests  which compare the actual daily trading related results against the estimated var with a one day holding period 
the following graph presents this comparison for the twelve months ended december  in no instance did a daily aggregate trading loss exceed the one day aggregate var measure associated with that date  which compares very favorably with the corporation s expectation for less than three such breaches 

pagejpg 
on march   fleetboston suffered its largest single day trading loss in over two years  primarily in its latin american exposures 
the corporation more than recovered the loss during the following two trading days  and the loss did not cause an overall breach of its risk measurement model 
in addition to the var framework  fleetboston employs other risk measurement tools to evaluate and control price risk 
these tools include cumulative loss limits and overall portfolio size limits  as well as regular stress tests and scenario analyses 
stress testing involves modifying the var model s assumptions to reflect rare events that have the potential for high impact 
scenario analyses involve calculating the impact of a pre determined set of events  irrespective of their statistical likelihood of occurrence 
such analyses may reflect historically observed market changes  incorporate specific scenarios that reflect some judgment about potential market conditions or identify the kind of scenario that would cause the most harm to existing positions 
during  fleetboston regularly evaluated and revised  as appropriate  these tests and analyses in light of ongoing market developments and conditions 
while the var framework and the additional risk measurement tools effectively ensure exposures remain within fleetboston s expressed tolerance for price risk  they do not guarantee the avoidance of trading losses during periods of extreme volatility 
balance sheet management activities us dollar denominated risk management us dollar denominated assets and liabilities comprise the majority of the balance sheet 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net income and financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates  is by far the most significant non trading market risk to which the us dollar denominated positions are exposed  and this risk results almost entirely from domestic operations 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines approved by alcco 
these limits and guidelines reflect fleetboston s tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term time horizons 
the major source of the corporation s non trading interest rate risk is the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between core banking assets and liabilities loans and deposits 
this difference  or mismatch  poses a risk to net interest income 
fleetboston controls this risk by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as simpler gap analyses  reflecting the known or assumed maturity  repricing  and other cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities 
these exposures are hedged using mainly fixed rate portfolio securities  interest rate swaps and options  and  when appropriate  forward rate agreements  options on swaps  and exchange traded futures and options 
simulation analysis involves dynamically modeling interest income and expense from current assets  liabilities and derivative positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures  primarily to measure the sensitivity of net interest income over relatively short eg  year time horizons 
key assumptions in these simulation analyses and in the valuation analyses discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the growth or shrinkage of product balances and the behavior of deposit and loan customers  with the most material assumptions relating to repricing and or runoff of noncontractual deposits 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  management uses simulation analysis to project earnings under various interest rate scenarios including reasonable or most likely  as well as deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely  scenarios 
thus the analyses may include immediate interest rate shocks  gradual interest rate ramps  spread narrowings widenings  and yield curve twists 
usually  each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario  but in some analyses  assumptions are deliberately manipulated to test the corporation s exposure to assumption risk 
the following table reflects the estimated exposure of net interest income for the next twelve months due to an immediate shift in forecasted interest rates 
estimated exposures set forth below are dependent on material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
rate change basis points estimated exposure to net interest income in millions as indicated  an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would tend to reduce net interest income but by an amount that is well within corporate limits 
an immediate basis point increase in interest rates wouldtend to enhance net interest income 
thus  the balance sheet position as of december  is modestly asset sensitive 
while an immediate and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  management believes that the exposure of net interest income to gradual and modest changes in interest rates is relatively insignificant 
estimated net interest income exposures at december  differ from those at year end  reflecting major changes in the economic environment and level of interest rates 
at december   the corporation anticipated economic weakness and had positioned the balance sheet to benefit from declining interest rates 
by december   interest rates had declined sharply  the economy seemed likely to stabilize and  consequently  the balance sheet was positioned for stable or rising rates 
nevertheless  the very low level of interest rates late in created additional exposures 
a further immediate basis point decline in rates  driving short term interest rates to approximately  would adversely impact net interest income by reducing the profitability of customer deposits and increasing prepayments of residential mortgages 
fleetboston also performs valuation analysis  which involves projecting future cash flows from current assets  liabilities and derivative positions over a very long term horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
the economic value of equity eve is the estimated net present value of these discounted cash flows 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates  and is used primarily to measure the exposure of earnings and equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long eg  year time horizon 
the following table reflects estimated eve exposures assuming an immediate shift in interest rates 
exposures are reported for shifts of basis points as well as basis points because the sensitivity of eve to changes in interest rates can be very nonlinear 
rate change basis points estimated exposure to economic value in millions as indicated  an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would reduce eve  but by an amount that is well within corporate limits 
while an immediate and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
estimated eve exposures at december  are larger and more asymmetrical than at year end as indicated earlier  the very low level of interest rates late in created additional exposures  as any further immediate sharp decline in rates would reduce the profitability of customer deposits and increase the prepayment of residential mortgages 
given very low rates  the corporation chose to shorten maturities of certain fixed rate asset positions investment securities and hedge derivatives and lengthen maturities of certain fixed rate liability positions long term debt and hedge derivatives 
both actions increased exposure to any sharp decline in long term interest rates 
non us dollar denominated risk management fleetboston s non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks 
the majority of the non us dollar denominated interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure stems from operations in latin america  primarily argentina and brazil 
historically  fleetboston s exposure to non trading interest rate risk in its latin american operations has not been significant  and at december   such risk continued to be insignificant outside of argentina 
within argentina  the ongoing political and economic instability has introduced several risks  including sovereign  cross border  credit  currency  and interest rate risks  which have become highly interrelated 
until the argentine crisis is resolved  the ultimate balances  currency denomination and maturity structure of certain assets and liabilities will remain uncertain  making it difficult to estimate precisely the amount of interest rate risk in that country 
exposure to foreign exchange rate risk in latin american operations is managed using currency limits as well as a var methodology  which is discussed in the trading activities section of this discussion and analysis 
additional information concerning fleetboston s interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks associated with its operations in argentina is included in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis

various internal audit  compliance and operating risk activities measure and assess the control environment on an ongoing basis 
a continuous audit process is in place to monitor high risk activities throughout the corporation 
quarterly  the current status of internal controls across fleetboston is evaluated and reported to executive management and the audit committee of the board 
a similar process exists to monitor and report significant compliance activities 
fleetboston has targeted programs for monitoring privacy  money laundering deterrence  fraud prevention and operating losses 
the operating risk and compliance committees  comprised of senior managers  provide additional oversight 
capital management a financial institution s capital serves to support asset growth and provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
fleetboston strives to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with its risk profile  on which an attractive return to stockholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while serving depositors  creditors and regulatory needs 
in determining optimal capital levels  fleetboston also considers the capital levels of its peers and the evaluations of the major rating agencies that assign ratings to its public debt 
common equity represents the stockholders investment in the corporation 
in addition to common equity  regulatory capital includes  within certain limits  preferred stock  trust preferred securities  subordinated debt and the reserve for credit losses 
in blending the requirements of each of these constituencies  fleetboston has established target capital ranges that it believes will provide for management flexibility and the deployment of capital in an optimally efficient and profitable manner 
these targets are reviewed periodically relative to fleetboston s risk profile and prevailing economic conditions 
fleetboston strives to maintain regulatory capital at approximately 
above the minimum regulatory requirements for a well capitalized institution  as defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
to be categorized as well capitalized  fleetboston and its banking subsidiaries must maintain a risk based total capital ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage ratio of at least  and not be subject to a written agreement  order or capital directive with any of its regulators 
at december   fleetboston and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios  and satisfied the requirements of the well capitalized category established by fdicia 
fleetboston also strives to maintain a tangible common equity to assets ratio of at least 
capital ratios december risk adjusted assets in millions   tier risk based capital minimum total risk based capital minimum leverage minimum common equity to assets total equity to assets tangible common equity to assets tangible common equity to managed assets tangible total equity to assets fleetboston s risk based capital ratios decreased compared with december   reflecting the impact of common stock repurchases and preferred stock redemptions  intangible assets recorded in connection with the liberty asset management acquisition  and charges to earnings primarily related to write downs of investments in the principal investing portfolio and political and economic conditions in argentina 
excess capital  defined as common equity above the capital target  is available for core business investments and acquisitions 
during  fleetboston purchased million outstanding shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
of the total purchased  million shares were purchased under board authorization granted in september as of december   the corporation had billion remaining under this authorization  which extends until december   and it is unlikely that the remaining authorization will be fully utilized 
in october  fleetboston redeemed all of the  outstanding shares of its series viii noncumulative preferred stock at its aggregate liquidation value of million  and in april  redeemed all of the  outstanding shares of its series v perpetual preferred stock at its aggregate liquidation value of million 
in april and july  fleetboston repurchased a total of  of the  outstanding shares of its series vi perpetual preferred stock  having an aggregate liquidation value of million 
as registered brokers dealers and member firms of the nyse  certain subsidiaries of the corporation are subject to rules of both the sec and the nyse 
these rules require members to maintain minimum levels of net capital  as defined  and may restrict a member from expanding its business and declaring dividends as its net capital approaches specified levels 
at december   these subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of approximately  million  which exceeded aggregate minimum net capital requirements by approximately  million 
comparison of and fleetboston s net income for was billion  or per diluted share  compared with billion  or per diluted share  in return on assets and return on equity were and  respectively  in compared with and  respectively  in the results included bankboston merger related branch divestiture gains of million  or million after tax 
results also included merger and integration costs of million  or million after tax  primarily associated with the bankboston merger 
the results included billion  or million after tax  of merger and related charges and special items recorded upon completion of the bankboston merger and million  or million after tax  of restructuring charges related to business realignments 
net interest income on an fte basis totaled billion in  compared to billion in the slight decrease was due to the impact of the required divestiture of approximately billion of low cost deposits and billion of loans during  and a higher cost of deposits 
partly offsetting the decline in net interest income was increased income earned on domestic loans and leases and securities  due to the higher interest rate environment 
net interest margin for was  compared with in this modest decrease was primarily attributable to branch divestitures  partly offset by the absence of low yielding earning assets previously necessary to support fleetboston s investment banking operation 
the provision for credit losses was billion in compared with billion in  the increase due principally to higher credit losses in the domestic c i loan portfolio  partially offset by lower levels of consumer credit losses  mainly related to credit card receivables 
noninterest income totaled billion for  up compared to  reflecting strong growth in capital markets and investment services businesses  particularly at quick reilly and robertson stephens  offset in part by lower banking fees and commissions and credit card revenue 
noninterest income for also included million of pre tax gains on branch divestitures 
noninterest expense totaled billion in  a decrease of from  due to lower merger and restructuring related charges and integration costs recorded in the period compared to  as well as expense reductions realized from merger integration activities 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in compensation and benefits costs directly attributable to higher levels of revenue 
total loans and leases at december  were billion  compared with billion at december  the decline was attributable to the above mentioned divestiture of billion of loans  new credit card and commercial loan securitizations completed during  lower levels of domestic c i loans  and the sale of approximately million of troubled commercial loans in december these declines were offset  in part  by strong growth in the domestic lease financing portfolio and international commercial loans  primarily in brazil 
total deposits decreased billion to billion at december   due principally to the aforementioned divestiture of approximately billion of deposits in  partially offset by an increase in demand deposits 
long term debt increased billion to billion resulting from the issuance of medium term floating rate notes  fixed rate senior notes  and trust preferred securities 
these issuances were offset partly by maturities and the redemption of floating rate subordinated notes 
recent accounting developments during the second and third quarters of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
required that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method for such transactions 
the new standard also requires identified intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if they meet certain criteria 
sfas no 
applies to all goodwill and identified intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
under the new standard  all goodwill  including that acquired before initial application of the standard  and indefinite lived intangible assets will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually 
identified finite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment when circumstances warrant 
within six months of initial application of the new standard  a transitional impairment test must be performed on all goodwill 
any ultimate impairment loss recognized must be reported as a change in accounting principle 
in addition to the transitional impairment test  the required annual impairment test must be performed in the year of adoption of the standard 
the new standard is required to be applied prospectively 
as required  the corporation adopted sfas no 
on january   and estimates that the elimination of goodwill amortization will reduce noninterest expense by approximately million million after tax for fleetboston completed the required transitional impairment test on all goodwill in the first quarter of  and no impairment loss resulted from the test
