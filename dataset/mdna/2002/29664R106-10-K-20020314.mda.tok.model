item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background we have devoted substantially all of our resources since we began our operations in may to the research and development of pharmaceutical product candidates for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 
we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company and have not generated any revenues from product sales 
we have not been profitable and have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million from inception may  through december  excluding the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for at least the next several years and until such time as we generate sufficient revenue to offset expenses 
research and development costs relating to product candidates will continue to increase 
manufacturing  sales and marketing costs will increase as we prepare for the commercialization of our products 
results of operations operating expenses year ended december  in thousands change change research and development of total general and administrative of total goodwill amortization of total purchased in process r d of total year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include both external and internal costs related to the research and development activities of our existing product candidates as well as discovery efforts on potential new product candidates 
external costs include costs related to manufacturing  clinical trials  toxicology or pharmacology studies performed by third parties  milestone payments under certain license agreements and other related expenses 
internal costs include all payroll and related costs attributable to research and development activities  as well as an allocation of overhead expenses incurred by the company 
research and development expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to lower manufacturing costs related to material used in our clinical trials  as well as lower costs related to pre clinical development of our biopharmaceutical product candidates during these decreases were partially offset by increased clinical trial costs 
clinical trial costs increased in as compared to as a result of the company conducting more trials and the types of clinical trials in were more costly per subject enrolled 
the magnitude of the company s operating expenses  particularly research and development expense  is largely dependent upon the timing and size of the clinical trials and manufacturing material to be used in those clinical trials 
as progresses  the company anticipates research and development expenses will increase over current year levels 
this increase in will result from the company conducting more clinical trials on its product candidates than in as well as higher manufacturing costs from the increased need for material and continued process development and scale up costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of salaries  employee benefits  and other costs associated with the company s finance  accounting  human resources  legal  
table of contents administrative and executive management functions 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher payroll  overhead and related costs in support of the company s anticipated growing research and development activities as compared to the increased payroll resulted from an increase in general and administrative personnel from at the end of to at the end of also included in the increased general and administrative expenses in  are costs associated with a market research study performed by a third party to provide the company with some preliminary assessment about product positioning and market potential of certain product candidates 
in addition  the company incurred higher costs related to the company s first annual reporting cycle as a public company including legal  accounting  printing and related services 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization reflects the amortization of the excess of the purchase price over net assets in the company s september acquisition of talaria therapeutics  inc talaria and the milestone payments made to date 
total goodwill was million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill amortization expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in goodwill amortization expense is a result of a full year of amortization in as well as increased goodwill being amortized upon the achievement of certain luv clinical development milestones in early the company has been amortizing this goodwill over five years  which represents the period estimated to be benefited from the acquisition  after considering such factors as product development timelines  revenue potential  competition and patent life 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  this statement is summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at effectiveness  an evaluation of goodwill will be required  and any impairment of goodwill at that time will be recognized as a cumulative effect of adoption 
as a result of the non amortization provisions of sfas  the company will no longer amortize goodwill effective january  in addition  based on management s current financial projections  management does not believe that goodwill and other intangibles are currently impaired 
the company will perform a more detailed assessment in the first quarter of to determine the effect of this new standard 
other income expense 
interest income increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents available for investment in  partially offset by lower interest rates in  as compared to interest expense for the same periods was approximately  and  respectively  and represents interest incurred on equipment financing facilities and a special project loan 
we recorded approximately  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  of foreign currency transaction gains on transactions denominated in various currencies of european countries  primarily the swedish kronor 
net loss 
the net loss was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in  as compared to  is primarily attributable to the non cash million purchased in process research and development write off in related to the acquisition of talaria 
year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include both external and internal costs related to the research and development activities of our existing product candidates as well as discovery efforts on potential new product candidates 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from costs associated with our etc clinical trial in  increased costs of manufacturing clinical material for our etc  etc and etc compounds  as well as other costs associated with developing these three product candidates 
in 
table of contents addition  we experienced increased development and discovery costs related to in licensing a new product candidate etc and discovering new hdl elevators over the past year 
finally  the increase in  as compared to  resulted from higher personnel and overhead costs in support of these increased research and development activities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses included the cost of salaries  employee benefits  and other payroll costs associated with the company s finance  accounting  human resources  legal  administrative and executive management functions 
general and administrative expenses also included an allocation of overhead expenses incurred by the company 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased general and administrative personnel and facility costs as well as certain costs related to both the initial public offering and private financings that were completed in goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization includes the amortization of purchase price in excess of net assets on the company s september acquisition of talaria 
the company has been amortizing this goodwill over five years  which represents the period estimated to be benefited from the acquisition  after considering such factors as product development timelines  revenue potential  competition and patent life 
purchased in process research and development 
on september   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of stock of talaria for  shares of restricted esperion common stock valued at per share 
 of the  shares of common stock were retired in in satisfaction of an indemnity obligation of the former talaria stockholders under the merger agreement with talaria and related documents 
the merger agreement provides for additional consideration to former talaria stockholders including payments upon the achievement of milestones and royalties upon the sale of any commercialized products 
milestones are due upon the enrollment of the first patient in certain clinical trials and upon each of the filing and approval of a new drug application in the united states 
the first milestone was achieved in the first quarter of these milestone payments increase the amount of the purchase price in the period when the milestone is achieved  and the company includes these additional amounts in goodwill 
as these additional milestone payments are added to the company s goodwill balance  the company will perform an annual assessment as to realizability of this asset  as required under sfas the royalty payments will be included in cost of sales in the period when the respective sales are recognized 
the combined milestone payments and royalties are subject to a maximum aggregate ceiling of million 
at the acquisition date  talaria was conducting development and testing activities related to luv 
the company believes that luv could provide advantages over current available therapies 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price for amounts due at closing was allocated to both tangible and intangible assets 
in connection with this allocation  the company recorded a one time charge to operations in the third quarter of to write off million associated with the in process research and development acquired in the transaction that had not reached technological feasibility 
the allocation of the purchase price was based on an independent appraisal of the fair values on the closing date using risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development project 
the company recorded approximately million as goodwill that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
this amount included  of acquisition related costs 
the goodwill is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of five years 
the million allocation to purchased in process research and development is based on the assumption that talaria s research and development activities of its luv product candidate had not yet reached technological feasibility  and that no alternative future uses have been identified 
at the acquisition date  the product candidate had exhibited satisfactory safety and efficacy results in preliminary testing  however  significant further investment is required to complete the development of the acquired technology  including completion of clinical trials  manufacturing scale up and successful regulatory approvals 
talaria had spent approximately million on the development of the in process project since its inception in and the patent holders had spent additional amounts on scientific research prior to at the time of acquisition  we expected to spend an additional million in third party development costs over all phases of the project 
table of contents prior to commercialization 
of these remaining costs  approximately million would relate to a phase iii clinical trial which is expected to commence after the phase ii clinical trials are completed  but not sooner than in making the purchase price allocation  management considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  as well as project risks 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes  penetration rates  therapy costs  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on management s estimates of milestone and royalty payments the acquired projects would command  as well as operating expenses and income taxes related to such projects 
the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on an estimated cost of capital calculation 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental project  a discount rate of was considered appropriate for the in process research and development 
this discount rate was commensurate with talaria s stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
if this project is not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the combined company may be adversely affected in future periods 
costs associated with the completion of the project have been and are expected to be consistent with the assumptions used in the valuation 
other income expense 
interest income increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents available for investment in due to the company s private financings and initial public offering 
interest expense for the same periods was approximately  and  respectively  and represents interest incurred on equipment financing facilities and a special project loan 
during  we recorded approximately  of foreign currency transaction gains on transactions denominated in various currencies of european countries  primarily the swedish kronor 
net loss 
the net loss was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase reflects increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses in addition to the non cash million purchased in process research and development write off  offset  in part  by the increase in interest income 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  includes a non cash million charge related to the beneficial conversion feature on the series c and d convertible preferred stock 
the total of the non cash beneficial conversion feature was reflected through equal and offsetting adjustments to additional paid in capital with no net impact on stockholders equity 
the beneficial conversion feature was considered in the determination of the company s loss per common share amounts in liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million  respectively 
cash proceeds in resulted primarily from a private placement of common stock by which we raised net proceeds of approximately million  offset by approximately million in cash used to fund operations 
our investment policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible by investing cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit risk by diversifying our investments 
we believe that our current cash position  along with 
table of contents available borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations as currently planned  capital expenditures and debt service until at least the end of during the years ended december   and  net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
this cash was used to fund our net losses for the periods  adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  primarily the result of the acquisition of laboratory equipment  furniture  fixtures and office equipment 
in addition  the company used approximately  in cash in connection with the acquisition of talaria in net cash proceeds from financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash proceeds from financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from million raised in the july private placement and million in additional borrowings on a special project loan and certain equipment term loans 
the proceeds were partially offset by  of cash used to repay borrowings under certain equipment term loans 
the net cash proceeds from financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from million raised in the initial public offering of common stock  million raised in preferred stock financings prior to the initial public offering  million in additional borrowings on a special project loan and certain equipment term loans  and  raised from the issuance of common stock to employees as part of the company s equity compensation plans 
the proceeds in were partially offset by  of cash used to repay borrowings under certain equipment term loans 
we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity  obtain credit from lenders  enter into strategic relationships  or to otherwise further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity  whether publicly or privately  could result in dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  from time to time  we may consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products or technology that might affect our liquidity requirements or position or cause us to issue additional securities 
there can be no assurance that financing or financing opportunities will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
as of december   the company has the following credit facilities and outstanding borrowings we have a credit facility with a us bank that was used to finance purchases of equipment 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
the original facility allowed for borrowings of up to million 
we have approximately  outstanding under this facility as of december  and no additional borrowings are allowed 
we have an additional credit facility with a us lending institution to finance purchases of equipment 
this facility allowed for borrowings of up to million 
we have approximately million outstanding under this facility at a weighted average interest rate of as of december  and no additional borrowings are allowed 
we also have a credit facility with a swedish entity totaling million swedish kronor million as of december  
the proceeds from this facility may only be used to finance the development of our etc product candidate 
if a related product is not developed or does not succeed in the market  our obligation to repay the loan may be forgiven 
borrowings under the loan facility bear interest at of which is payable quarterly 
the remaining of interest together with principal is payable in five equal annual installments starting in december the outstanding borrowings  including accrued interest  amounted to million swedish kronor million as of december  we have a memorandum of understanding with an economic development group in michigan whereby we can borrow up to  for equipment purchases at an interest rate of 
as of december   outstanding borrowings under this arrangement totaled  
table of contents we have a million credit facility with a us bank that may be used to finance purchases of equipment 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of december  the facility expires in may we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the next twelve months will be approximately million 
we expect that these expenditures will primarily include lab and computer equipment 
we lease our corporate and research and development facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through december under certain arrangements  including our headquarters facility  we may extend these leases for additional periods 
total minimum future payments under these leases are approximately million as of december   including  in we have entered into license and other agreements with certain third parties  which require us to make payments upon achievement of the milestones set forth in the agreements  which contingent payments could amount to million  and  if we sell products using technology licensed under the agreements  to make royalty payments to the licensor pursuant to formulas in the agreements 
there can be no assurance that we will meet any or all of the milestones in  or sell any products requiring royalty payments under  our license agreements 
we expect that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase in future periods 
we intend to hire additional research and development  clinical and administrative staff 
our capital expenditure requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time required to file and process regulatory approval applications  the development of commercial manufacturing capability  the ability to obtain additional licensing arrangements  and the demand for our product candidates  if and when approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
income taxes as of december   we had operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in additionally  utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under section of the internal revenue code 
these and other deferred income tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to historical losses 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
of these employees  were engaged in research  preclinical and clinical development  regulatory affairs  intellectual property activities  and or manufacturing activities and were engaged in finance  legal and general administrative activities 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations 
the most significant changes made by sfas are requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requiring unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain rather than being deferred and amortized 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets  and primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
the most significant changes made by sfas are that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
sfas 
table of contents also specifies that certain intangible assets that were previously identified as separate from goodwill ie  assembled workforce are not considered separately identifiable for purposes of this standard and should be included as part of goodwill and subject to the non amortization provisions for sfas the provisions for sfas will be effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  at effectiveness  an evaluation of goodwill will be required  and any impairment of goodwill at that time will be recognized as a cumulative effect of adoption 
total goodwill included in the company s consolidated financial statements was million at december  and million at december  goodwill amortization expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the non amortization provisions of sfas  goodwill amortization expense will be eliminated effective january  in addition  based on management s current financial projections  management does not believe that goodwill and other intangibles are currently impaired 
the company will perform a more detailed assessment to determine the effect of this new standard in sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  and is not expected to have a material impact on us upon effectiveness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense
