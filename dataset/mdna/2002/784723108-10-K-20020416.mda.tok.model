item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we provide professional internet data security services and develop and market software and microprocessor based products needed to secure electronic commerce and communications over the internet and other communications networks based on internet protocols 
our primary technology offerings use pki  which is the standard technology for securing internet based commerce and communications 
in addition  pulsar  a wholly owned subsidiary  is an established computer and networking product reseller that focuses on resales to government agencies  large corporate accounts and state and local governments 
we acquired pulsar in june in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
before  we were solely a provider of electronic interconnect products to government and commercial entities 
in  we formed our data security division  which is the basis of our operations today 
the data security division was engaged primarily in research and development until when it began to generate meaningful revenue 
in september  we sold our intercon division  which consisted of the assets relating to our interconnect operations  for cash to allied signal inc  an unrelated  publicly traded company 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and we acquired pulsar in june  and our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december   include the results of pulsar s operations since june  in august  we acquired biz and our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december   include the results of biz s operations since august  therefore  revenue and expenses are not comparable from period to period 
total revenue 
total revenue increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  and decreased from million during to million during the year ended december  the increase from to consisted of a million increase in network solutions market revenue primarily attributable to a full year of sales in as compared to a partial year in  a million increase in data security products and services revenue primarily attributable to an increase in sales of existing data security products and services  and a  decrease in research and development revenue attributable to the completion in of the contract that was responsible for generating research and development revenue 
the decrease from to consisted of an  increase in data security products and services revenue primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume of existing data security products and services  and a million decrease in network solutions market revenue primarily attributable to our inability to accept and fulfill a large number of customer orders due to reduced accounts receivable financing availability and as our primary vendors being unwilling to sell additional product to us on open account because of significant past due amounts for goods we had previously purchased from them 
during  and of revenue was generated from sales to the united states immigration and naturalization service and the united states department of state  respectively 
during  of revenue was generated from sales to the united states immigration and naturalization service 
during  of revenue was generated from sales to the united states immigration and naturalization service 
sales to federal government agencies accounted for approximately  and of sales during  and  respectively 
product revenue 
product revenue increased from million during to million during and decreased from to million during the increase from to consisted of a million increase in network deployment products revenue and a million increase in data security products revenue 
the decrease from to consisted of a million decrease in network deployment products revenue and a  increase in data security products revenue 
license and service revenue 
license and service revenue increased from million during to million during and decreased from million during to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase of  related to an ongoing government support contract that began in august and to the recognition of  of revenue  out of a total of  
table of contents contract  which requires us to provide customer support for three years 
the balance of this  contract has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized over the remainder of the support period 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to a  decrease in electric security systems revenues 
the electric security systems product line was discontinued in july  and no revenues were recognized in research and development revenue 
research and development revenue represents amounts earned under a contract with the nsa for the design of a microprocessor meeting minimum specifications established by the nsa 
we have contracted with others to perform aspects of the project 
all related project costs were expensed as research and development was incurred 
regardless of the results of the development efforts  the amounts received from the nsa are nonrefundable 
the related research and development costs were not separately identifiable 
therefore  the corresponding costs of the entire development effort were included in research and development expenses 
research and development revenue was  during the contract that resulted in research and development revenue was completed in and no further research and development revenue is anticipated under this contract 
product gross margin 
product gross margin increased as a percentage of net product revenue from during to during and decreased to during the increase from to was primarily attributable to the proportionately higher increase in revenue related to data security products as compared to network deployment products 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to a reduction in margins related to network deployment products that resulted from having to pay higher prices for product from secondary suppliers because our primary vendors were unwilling to sell to us on open account 
in addition  data security products margins also decreased mainly due to significant reduction in the average selling price of one of our key products 
during network deployment products represented of product revenue as compared to data security products that represented of product revenue 
during network deployment products represented of product revenue as compared to data security products that represented of product revenue 
margins from the sale of data security products are significantly greater than the margins from the sale of network deployment products 
in addition  data security products margins also decreased mainly due to significant reduction in the average selling price of one of our key products 
license and service gross margin 
license and service gross margin increased as a percentage of license and service revenue from during to during and increased to during the increase from to was primarily attributable to discontinuing the ess product line 
gross margins associated with the ess product line were significantly less than the gross margins associated with data security services 
the ess product line was discontinued in july selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million during to million during and increased from to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to twelve months of pulsar related selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to approximately six months in the increase from to was primarily attributable to the addition of personnel expenses associated with the biz acquisition of approximately million  a net loss on a lease for new operating facilities of approximately million  partially offset by a reduction in compensation expense of approximately  and other net reductions totaling approximately million 
the net loss on a lease was the result of a lease entered into in october for new operating facilities 
after entering into the lease we determined that we would not need all of the space contracted for and therefore we recorded a loss on the lease net of estimated sublease income 
compensation expense reductions included  related to pulsar were primarily for reductions in salary and commission expenses due to decreased revenues and the need to adjust cost structures accordingly 
reductions not related to pulsar were primarily attributable to reductions in salary  travel  professional fees  printing and office expenses 
expense reductions not related to pulsar were done in an effort to reduce current cash expenditures 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during to during and increased to during the percentage increase from to was primarily attributable to the revenues generated by pulsar during and the percentage increase from to was partially the result of the overall increase in expenses but was primarily attributable to the significant decrease in revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million during to million during and increased from to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to significant increased staffing related to product development  including development efforts 
table of contents related to the forte microprocessor  maestro  profile manager  netsign and token reader writers 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to continued development related to those same projects that were responsible for the staffing increases in and the addition of personnel expense from the biz acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  expenses increased from during to during and increased to during the percentage increase from to was primarily attributable to increased staffing 
the percentage increase from to was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of our research and development efforts combined with the significant decrease in revenues 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
in june  we acquired pulsar 
all of the outstanding shares of pulsar were exchanged for  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in the fourth quarter of we determined the integration of pulsar would not be completed as planned and the anticipated operating synergies would not be realized 
as a result  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we analyzed the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangibles relating to the acquisition of pulsar 
in order to evaluate the recoverability of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets  we engaged the services of an independent valuation firm to perform a valuation 
in the fourth quarter of  based on the results of the independent valuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to unamortized intangible assets acquired in the purchase of pulsar 
based on the independent valuation  we believed that after the impairment charge of million  no further impairment existed at december  as of december   the remaining unamortized intangible assets of  acquired in the purchase of pulsar will be amortized over the remainder of their year life 
in august  we acquired biz acquisition 
all of the outstanding shares of biz were exchanged for  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of the acquisition we acquired million of identifiable intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of we determined that the other intangible assets and a portion of goodwill related to the acquisition of biz would not be realized 
as a result  we analyzed the recoverability of the intangible assets relating to the acquisition of biz 
based on the results of our analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to unamortized identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisition of biz 
based on our analysis  we believe that after the impairment charge of million  no further impairment existed at december  the remaining identifiable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of biz is goodwill which will no longer be amortized in accordance with sfas acquired in process research and development during the year ended december   we recorded an in process research and development ipr d charges of million related to the acquisition 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d for the acquisition was approximately of the total purchase price of million 
an independent third party investment banking firm  was retained to estimate the fair value of purchased ipr d 
at the acquisition date  biz was in the process of developing technology that would deliver security features to customers  and develop a new platform for delivering its product 
the ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative uses  and may not have achieved commercial viability 
at the valuation date  the new technology had not reached a completed prototype stage  although some beta testing on portions of the technology had begun 
at the valuation date  the ipr d was ranged between and complete  based on costs incurred on the ipr d through the acquisition date versus the total costs estimated to complete the project 
the ipr d project was valued using the income forecast method 
this method took into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology  the market rates of return on contributory assets  including assembled workforce  merchant agreements working capital and fixed assets 
the cash flows were then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate was determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
the resulting net cash flows to which discount rates of to were applied were based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes from such acquired in process technology 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization expense increased from million during to million during and decreased from to  during the increase from to was primarily attributable to a full year of amortization expense related to unamortized intangible assets in compared to six months during when we acquired pulsar 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to the reduction of goodwill and other intangibles that resulted from the million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of amortization expense in was comprised of  related to pulsar intangibles and  related to biz identifiable intangible assets 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased from  during to  during and increased from to  during the decrease from to was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of  a reduction in interest expense of  and a one time non operating credit of  the increase from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of  a decrease in interest expense of  and a realized loss on trading securities of  income taxes 
for the income tax benefit of  was primarily attributable to prior year tax refunds received that exceeded amounts recorded as receivable in prior years 
for the income tax expense of  was primarily attributable to minimum california franchise taxes 
for the income tax expense was attributable to the reversal of previously recognized tax credits because it was determined that they would not be realized 
backlog 
at december   and total backlog was  million and million respectively 
orders are subject to cancellation in certain circumstances  and backlog may therefore not be indicative 
table of contents of future operating results 
the increase in the backlog at december   was attributable to an increase of  related to data security products and  related to network deployment products 
the backlog of data security products at december   consisted primarily of unfilled orders for the argus materials required to assemble the argus were not received until january once the necessary materials were received  the argus readers were assembled and shipped during the first quarter of the backlog of network deployment products at december   was the result of orders that were received too close to the end of the year to be shipped before the end of the year 
the backlog at december   was made up of  related to data security products and  related to network deployment products 
the  related to network deployment products was caused by our inability to obtain product from our vendors to fulfill customer orders 
if we are not able to obtain the product necessary to fulfill these orders they will have to be cancelled 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we based our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales  including hardware with embedded software and software  upon shipment unless contract terms call for a later date 
revenue from network deployment products is recognized upon transfer of title  generally upon delivery 
we record an allowance to cover estimated warranty costs in cost of sales 
customers do not have the right of return except for product defects  and product sales are not contingent upon customer testing  approval and or acceptance 
the costs of providing post contract customer support are not significant 
revenue under service and development contracts is recorded as services are rendered 
revenue from time and material  network deployment service contracts is recognized on the basis of man hours incurred plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain identifiable technology and developed technology acquired in connection with the biz acquisition were no longer going to be pursued 
additionally  we anticipate a delay or indefinite reduction in projected revenues from the acquisition 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis 
as the result of that analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to million in identifiable technology  million in developed technology and million in goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of biz 
after this impairment charge  goodwill is the only remaining intangible asset 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the analysis could result in significantly different results than those identified above and those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had deficit working capital of million and we incurred a loss from operations of million and used cash in operating activities of million for the year then ended 
we expect to continue to incur substantial additional losses in the current year 
given our december  cash balance of million and our projected operating cash requirements  we anticipate that our existing capital resources will not be adequate to satisfy our cash flow requirements through the december  we will require additional funding 
our cash flow estimates are based upon achieving certain levels of sales  reductions in operating expenses and liquidity available under the accounts receivable line 
should sales be less than forecast  expenses be higher than forecast or the liquidity not be available under our accounts receivable line or through additional financings of debt and or equity  we will not have adequate resources to fund its operations 
during the past year  we have incurred defaults under both our line of credit secured by accounts receivable and the long term convertible notes 
we secured waivers for our accounts receivable line through march  and for the long term convertible notes through december  however  there is no guarantee the lenders will continue to waive defaults in the future  should they occur  and the lenders may declare amounts owed by us due and payable 
subsequent to march   we remained in default under the line of credit 
we do not expect future fixed obligations through december  to be paid by cash generated from operating activities 
we intend to satisfy fixed obligations from  but not limited to the following i additional financings  ii use of our accounts receivable line  iii extending vendor payments  and iv issuing stock as payment on obligations 
during the twelve months ended december   cash used in operations was million primarily attributable to a net loss of million  which included an impairment charge of million related to unamortized goodwill and other intangibles assets 
the net loss was primarily offset by the million noncash impairment charge of goodwill and other intangibles  million of noncash depreciation and amortization  million increase of in process research and development  a million increase in accounts payable  million increase in accrued liabilities  and a million increase in accrued rent 
during the twelve months ended december   cash used in operations was million primarily attributable to a net loss of million  which included an impairment charge of million related to unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets 
the net loss was primarily offset by the million noncash impairment charge of goodwill and other intangibles  million of noncash depreciation and amortization and a reduction in accounts receivable of million 

table of contents during the twelve months ended december   cash provided by investing activities was  versus  cash used in the increase was attributable to the net cash paid for the biz acquisition of  offset by a decrease of  related to the purchase of property and equipment during the year ended december  however  during the year ended december   the decrease of  related to property and equipment purchased was partially offset by  of previously restricted cash related to our revolving credit line that was reclassified as unrestricted cash 
finally  during the year ended december   we received proceeds of  from the sale of trading securities versus in during the twelve months ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million  the same as the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of borrowings of million under bank agreements 
these borrowings were offset by repayments of million under these bank agreements 
furthermore  million was provided by the issuance of long term convertible debt 
the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of borrowings of million under bank and other borrowing agreements 
these borrowings were offset by repayments of million under bank and other borrowing agreements 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows for the last several years  and as of december   had a deficit accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations principally through the issuance of common stock total proceeds net of issuance costs from our public offering of approximately million 
in june  we entered into a three year lending agreement with guaranty business credit corporation gbcc permitting borrowings under a million secured revolving line of credit facility that commenced on june  the agreement provided for an annual interest rate of prime plus  and a pledge of substantially all of our personal and real property as collateral 
although the credit facility was for borrowings up to million  under the terms of the agreement the amount of borrowing available to us was subject to a maximum borrowing limitation based on eligible collateral 
on april   the terms of our revolving line of credit were amended 
under the terms of the amended agreement the maximum borrowings were million  eligible collateral excluded inventory and the advance rate was 
in addition  certain of the financial covenants and requirements were adjusted 
the amended million revolving credit facility also contained various covenants and restrictions 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we were required to obtain the lender s consent for any merger  acquisition or consolidation 
the lender was not willing to give its consent to our acquisition of biz and discontinued making advances under the terms of the amended agreement effective with the acquisition 
the lender applied all collections subsequent to the acquisition to outstanding borrowings until such borrowings and related interest charges were paid in full 
all amounts due to the lender were paid in full on october  once all amounts were paid in full the lender released its security interest in our assets 
on july   chase manhattan bank chase advanced to our co chairman  mr 
winkler  million which mr 
winkler advanced to biz for the re purchase of preferred stock held by an investor in biz 
mr 
winkler executed a million demand note with chase and biz executed a million demand note due september  with jaw financial  jaw jaw  an entity controlled by mr 
winkler 
the demand note contained an interest charge of prime plus through the maturity date and prime plus after the maturity date 
on october   we made a principal payment of  paid accrued interest  and executed a new promissory note to jaw for  the terms of the promissory note call for interest of prime plus payable monthly  together with five monthly payments of principal in the amount of  and one final payment on april  in the amount of  the promissory note provides chase a security interest in the shares in wave systems corp 
owned by us  and subject to chase s loan security guidelines  including the rights to proceeds from any sales of those shares 
the loan was paid in full on march  during october and november we and our wholly owned subsidiary  pulsar  entered into financing agreements with wells fargo business credit  inc wfbc  which provides for the factoring of accounts receivable 
the agreements contain no limit on the dollar volume of receivable financing  but does provide for wfbc s approval of credit limits for non government customers 
the discount rate charged is of the gross receivable  which may be increased by 
per day for accounts that do not pay within days of the receivable purchase 
at the time of purchase  terms call for wfbc to advance of the gross receivable  with the balance remitted after collection of the invoice less the discount and any other charges 
we were in violation of the covenant to pay debts and obligations as they come due and delays in misdirected payments 
we requested a waiver of these defaults and received a waiver through march  and january   respectively 
we are in default and anticipate being in default of this provision in the future unless we raise sufficient working capital 
the balances due wfbc are guaranteed by mr 
shah and mr 
winkler  our co chairmen and co chief executive officers 
in december  our co chairmen  each purchased a three year  subordinated convertible note  in a total private placement of million of such notes 
these notes were intended to convert into a subsequent financing  which is described below 
in connection with the issuance of the subordinated convertible notes we incurred approximately  of issuance costs  which primarily consisted of legal and other professional fees  and which are to be paid upon completion of the subsequent financing described below 
all subordinated convertible notes mature december   bear interest at a rate of per annum  which will be paid quarterly in cash or rolled into the subsequent financing described below  upon a financing of million or more in equity or convertible securities in a private placement to institutional investors  the subordinated convertible notes are convertible into such financing on the same terms and conditions  at the election of the holders  subordinated convertible notes are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
in april  the subordinated convertible notes of our co chairmen were amended to provide that their notes can only be converted upon a financing of million or more in equity or convertible securities in a private placement to institutional investors at a conversion price that represents a or less discount to the trading price of the company s stock and extended their term to december  after december   we may call for mandatory conversion of the subordinated convertible notes prior to maturity if the company s common shares trade at or above an average price of of the conversion price for twenty consecutive trading days and average volume of  shares per day for twenty consecutive trading days 
as of december   we were in violation of certain provisions of the subordinated convertible notes pertaining to i payment of debts and obligations as they come due  ii violation of provisions within the wfbc agreements  and iii payment of interest on these notes due march  we requested and received a waiver for these violations through january   see notes to consolidated financial statements 
on april   simultaneous with the filing of our form k we closed a financing whereby  with the exception of mr 
winkler and mr 
shah  the noteholders converted their subordinated convertible notes into secured convertible promissory notes convertible at per share  with detachable warrants 
over the past three years  we have spent substantial sums on research and development r d activities 
during that time period  we incurred substantial losses from continuing operations 
as a result of these and other changes  we currently have a deficit in working capital and an accumulated deficit 
while we believe the r d expenditures created significant future revenue producing opportunities  some of the related products are just entering production 
we are currently involved in sales pursuits relative to these products that  if successful  will generate significant revenues 
however  unless we receive orders for these new products and receive significant financing  we can no longer support the current level of research and development activity 
while we have reduced our staffing levels  if sales fail to materialize  we will need to further reduce expenses through additional reductions in staff 
reduced accounts receivable financing availability caused us to re evaluate the operations of our networking business and our primary vendors being unwilling to sell additional product to us on open account because of significant past due amounts for goods we had previously purchased from them 
this caused a substantial reduction in the sales and related cost of sales during the year  which in turn reduced cashflow 
the reduced cashflow impaired our ability to meet vendor commitments as they became due 
in october  we signed a development agreement with wave systems corp 
wave for the integration of embassy based systems with set top box master reference designs of broadcom corporation 
the development agreement was amended in may under this amended agreement  we are required to pay wave  per month beginning june  through december  for work to be performed  for a total of million 
should we not make the required monthly payments  wave may request payment in the form of common stock 
as of december   we owed million to wave for which they have tendered monthly notices of default 
under the terms of the agreement  if the default notices are not cured within thirty days of written notice  the unpaid installment converts the obligation for delinquent installments from a cash obligation into a stock acquisition right sar 
an sar gives wave the right to acquire a number of fully paid  nonassessable shares of our common stock determined by dividing the fair market value the average closing price of our common stock for the ten trading day period prior to the date of exercise of a share of our common stock on the date of exercise of the sar into the aggregate portion of the installment payments declared to be in default and such default was not cured 
to date  wave has made no request for issuance of stock 
the million obligation is carried in accrued liabilities of december  further  to conserve cash we do not intend to pay in cash the monthly billings due under the amended agreement 
in february  based upon a verbal agreement the work under the contract was suspended along with the related billings 
the suspension does not decrease the obligation to purchase development services in the future 
we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance under the amended agreement 
separately  should we not purchase million of goods or services from wave by june   our exclusivity related to certain customers will  at wave s option  become non exclusive 
in november  we executed an alliance agreement with electronic data systems corporation eds for the marketing of our products to eds customers alliance 
the alliance calls for a joint working relationship between the two companies  is non exclusive and has a term of ten years 
in february  we and eds executed an engagement letter for eds to provide certain information technology and consulting services for both our organizational structure and for a specific customer project 
under these engagements  eds billed  of which remained unpaid as of december  on august   eds and we executed a letter of intent and temporary working agreement whereby eds supplied software and hardware for re sale to pulsar customers pulsar agreement 
under the pulsar agreement  as of december    remained outstanding and unpaid to eds for purchases of hardware and software 
we and eds executed a master services agreement dated as of november  msa whereby beginning december  and ending december   we and eds established a strategic teaming relationship to implement  sell and deliver a set of secure transaction processing offerings based upon a trust assurance network tan 
the msa task order task order requires that we pay a monthly fee of for account  test and lab management services beginning january  the obligations for these services can be terminated beginning january  by giving ninety days prior written notice and payment of  or beginning january  by giving ninety days prior written notice and payment of further  the task order provides for eds to provide tan hosting and implementation in exchange for an implementation fee of payable october  once installation of the production environment tan is complete  eds agrees to host the tan in exchange for a monthly service fee of for thirty six months and per month for the remaining months of the msa 
we may delay implementation of the tan by paying a fee of prior to january  we may terminate the task order without cause by paying after january  and providing ninety days prior written notice 
in the event we are unable to obtain intellectual property rights or licensing consents that may be required  if any  prior to january   and the parties determine there are no software alternatives  then after giving ninety days prior written notice we may terminate the task order by paying we arranged for the lease of two buildings approximating  square feet that were under construction 
our co chairman mr 
shah  has a ownership interest in the entity that owns the two buildings 
the leases have an aggregate monthly rental totaling approximately  plus common area costs for seven years 
on one building totaling approximately  square feet  we sublet one half of the building on terms and conditions matching the underlying lease 
the sublease is with a related party company owned by our co chairman  mr 
winkler 
while that company made a lease deposit  it has not made the monthly rent payment and accordingly is currently delinquent on its rent payments to us 
we are in negotiations with the landlord regarding being released from obligations under the lease for the second building totaling  square feet 
we intend to release the sub tenant and occupy the  square foot building based upon having raised million of convertible notes see below 
we have accrued million as an estimate for anticipated costs relative to the disposition of the  square foot building net of anticipated offsetting sublease income  which may be partially recovered depending on future events that cannot be estimated 
our significant fixed commitments with respect to leases and inventory purchases as of april  are as follows payments for the year ended december  contractual obligations total after convertible notes    operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations   with our deficit working capital position  we will not be able to meet existing obligations as they become due 
we will use receivables and investments to generate liquidity and are in negotiations with vendors for extended terms on current obligations 
to remedy the working capital deficiency  we are in discussions with financing sources and simultaneous to the filing of this form k  raised million of convertible notes 
we currently have a need for a substantial amount of capital to meet our liquidity requirements 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors including  but not limited  to the ability to extend terms of payment to vendors the market acceptance of products and services the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch new products and services and attain a competitive position in the market place research and development plans levels of inventory and accounts receivable technological advances competitors responses to our products and services relationships with partners  suppliers and customers projected capital expenditures downturn in economy defaults on financing that will impact the availability of borrowings reductions in the valuation of investment 
table of contents as of december   we had available net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
because of the change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation on the utilization of these carryforwards against taxable income in future periods if a cumulative change in ownership of more than of the company occurs within any three year period 
we have made no determination concerning whether there has been such a cumulative change in ownership 
however  we believe that it is likely that such a change in ownership occurred prior to or following the completion of our acquisition of biz in august our current financial condition is the result of several factors including the following our operating results were below expectations 
sales of products through channels acquired in the acquisition are taking longer than originally anticipated to develop 
market demand for our xboard product formerly known as cipherserver product line did not materialize as anticipated and therefore our sales were below forecast 
reduced credit line availability affected the sales volume of our pulsar subsidiary 
research and development expenses from the biz acquisition increased our costs 
the events of september  affected the operations and delayed the decisions of the us government 
this caused sales we had anticipated to be substantially delayed 
the events may also affect potential investors and related terms of investment capital 
in addition to our current deficit working capital situation  current operating plans show a shortfall of cash during we intend to mitigate our position through one or more of the following 
table of contents additional equity capital we will seek additional equity capital  if available 
equity capital will most likely be issued at a discount to market  and require the issuance of warrants causing a dilution to current shareholders 
in addition  providers of new equity capital may require additional concessions in order for them to provide needed capital to us 
additional convertible debt depending upon the market conditions  we may issue an additional debt instrument 
the types of instruments available in the 
table of contents market would likely contain a provision for the issuance of warrants and may also be convertible into equity 
on april   simultaneous with the filing this annual report on form k  we completed a private placement of million in the form of million in secured convertible promissory notes   in secured non convertible promissory notes  held by co chairman mr 
shah and  held by co chairman mr 
winkler and the pre payment of a  note due from kris shah  less a discount of  the discount was based upon a present value using an annual rate of for early payment and will be charged against earnings during the second quarter of in connection with the issuance of the secured convertible promissory notes we incurred approximately  of issuance costs  which primarily consisted of investment banker fees  legal and other professional fees 
these promissory notes mature december   bear interest at a rate of per annum  which will be paid quarterly in cash or  at the company s discretion should we need to conserve cash  in common shares based upon the trailing thirty day average prior to the interest due date  and the million of convertible promissory notes  in whole or in part  are convertible at the option of the holder into an aggregate of approximately  shares of the company s common stock at any time prior to maturity  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions  and the convertible promissory notes have detachable warrants exercisable for three years to purchase an additional  shares at the price of per share 
we may call for mandatory conversion of the convertible notes prior to maturity if common shares trade at or above an average price of per share for twenty consecutive trading days with average volume of  shares per day for consecutive trading days 
we are not subject to restrictive covenants related to the secured convertible or non convertible promissory notes  other than not being allowed to pledge intellectual property as collateral 
off balance sheet financing our operations are not relatively capital intensive 
however  should we need to add equipment or decide to expand our facilities  we may use an operating lease transaction to acquire the use of capital assets 
an operating lease would not appear on our balance sheet and would be charged as an expense as payments accrue 
we will finance receivables in conjunction with the wfbc agreement to generate cash 
in the past we incurred defaults under the wfbc line for late payments to vendors  for which we received waivers through range from january  through march  we are in default and anticipate defaults in the future  and we may not receive the required waivers and may not have funds available under the line 
we will sell investments to generate cash 
the market value of trading securities was approximately million at december  since that date  we have generated over  through the sales of securities 
we are negotiating with vendors regarding payment of existing accounts payable over extended terms of months with no interest 
we have reached a verbal agreement with one large vendor and are working with remaining vendors 
we previously executed term out agreements with a number of vendors that must now be further extended 
deferral of cash payments through suspension of development projects 
issuance of stock as payment for existing and future obligations 
we anticipate paying the wave accrued liabilities of million as of december  from future issuance of common stock to wave 
issuance of stock to pay interest on long term debt 
reductions in work force 
should we not receive adequate financing  we could be forced to merge with another company or cease operations 
while we have a history of selling products in the government markets  new products just entering production after years of development have no sales history 
additionally  we are entering commercial markets with our products and are still developing acceptance of its offerings 
considerable uncertainty currently exists with respect to the adequacy of current funds to support our activities beyond december  this uncertainty will continue until a positive cash flow from operations is achieved 
additionally  we are uncertain as to the availability of financing from other sources to fund any cash deficiencies 
in order to reduce this uncertainty  the company continues to evaluate additional financing options and may therefore elect to raise capital  from time to time  through equity or debt financings in order to capitalize on business opportunities and market conditions and to insure the continued marketing of current product offerings together with development of new technology  products and services 
there can be no assurance that we can raise additional financing in the future 
based upon forecast sales and expense levels  we currently anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents  investments  term out arrangements with vendors  the proceeds of a million financing on april  described below and the current availability under our wfbc factoring agreements will be sufficient to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  our forecast is based upon certain assumptions  which may differ than actual future outcomes 
we have incurred defaults under its financing agreements in the past 
if we incur a default in the future under our accounts receivable line of credit or other financing instruments  we may not be able to draw funds thereby affecting our ability to fund operations 
at this time we are currently in default and anticipate that we will continue to be in default unless we are able to raise sufficient capital to pay debts and obligations as they become due 
additionally  without a substantial increase in sales or a reduction in expenses  we will continue to incur operating losses 
simultaneous with the filing of this annual report on form k  we closed the round of convertible debt financing described above to provide million in additional working capital and are in discussions with several sources of regarding up to an additional million on the same terms and conditions 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on july   fasb issued statements no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
poolings initiated prior to june  are grandfathered 
sfas replaces the requirement to amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill with a requirement for an impairment test 
sfas also requires an evaluation of intangible assets and their useful lives and a transitional impairment test for goodwill and certain intangible assets 
after the transition  the impairment tests must be performed annually 
a company must adopt sfas at the beginning of the fiscal year 
thus  as a calendar year end company  we must adopt sfas 
no later than january  we are currently examining the impact of this pronouncement on its results of operations and financial position 
while we believe there will be a material impact  the amount has not yet been determined 
fasb recently issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
sfas also requires the enterprise to record the contra to the initial obligation as an increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and to depreciate that cost over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently examining the impact of this pronouncement on the results of its operations and financial position  but currently believe the impact will not be material 
on october   fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas sfas  retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principle board opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently examining the impact of this pronouncement on its results of operations and financial position  but currently believe the impact will not be material 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business we have a history of losses and may incur future losses we may not become profitable or significantly increase our revenue 
we incurred net loss of million for the twelve month period ended december  and net operating losses of million and net loss of million for the twelve month period ended december  to achieve profitability  we will need to generate and sustain sufficient revenues while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses primarily to support research and development and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
these expenditures may not result in increased revenues or customer growth 
we do not know when or if we will become profitable 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our stock price is extremely volatile the trading price of our common stock is highly volatile as a result of factors specific to us or applicable to our market and industry in general 
these factors  include variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  company issued earnings announcements that vary from consensus analyst estimates  changes by financial research analysts in their recommendations or estimates of our earnings  conditions in the economy in general or in the information technology service sector in particular  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  and unfavorable publicity or changes in applicable laws and regulations  or their judicial or administrative interpretations  affecting us or the information technology service sectors 
in addition  the stock market has recently been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  some companies have been sued by their stockholders 
if we were sued  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
we have not generated any sales to date of our ssp solution suite  which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business performance and future prospects to date  we have not had any sales of our ssp solution suite and have not established a sales and marketing force to promote this product 
we may be unable to establish sales and marketing operations to levels necessary for us to grow this portion of our business  especially if we are unsuccessful at selling this product into vertical markets 
we may not be able to support the promotional programs required by selling simultaneously into several markets 
if we are unable to develop an efficient sales system  our operating results will suffer 
late payments may have damaged relationships with our vendors 
slow and delinquent payments may cause vendors not to sell products to us  or only with advance payment 
should this occur  we will not have components and services available for our products 
the average selling price of our products may decrease  which may reduce gross margins the average selling prices for our products may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments 
the pricing of products depends on the specific features and functions of the products  purchase volumes and the level of sales and service support required 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
as we experience pricing pressure  we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decrease over product life cycles 
these same competitive pressures may require us to write down the carrying value of inventory on hand  if any 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of customers and  therefore  the loss of even one of these customers could significantly and negatively impact our operating results we depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue and many of our contracts with our significant customers are short term contracts 
the non renewal of any significant contract upon expiration  or a substantial reduction in sales to any of our significant customers  would adversely affect our business unless we were able to replace the revenue we received from these customers 
during the twelve month period ended december   we derived of our consolidated revenue from one customer and during the twelve month period ended december   we derived of our consolidated net revenue from one customer 
if the ssp solution suite is not commercially successful  our operating results will suffer although we have had some success selling our security solutions to government agencies  we are just beginning to enter the complex and competitive commercial market for digital commerce and communication security solutions 
we believe that many potential customers in our target markets are not fully aware of the need for security products and services in the digital economy 
historically  only enterprises having substantial resources developed or purchased security solutions for internet or other means of delivering digital content 
also  there is a perception that security in delivering digital content is costly and difficult to implement 
therefore  we will not succeed unless we can educate our target markets about the need for security in delivering digital content and convince potential customers of our ability to provide this security in a cost effective and easy to use manner 
even if we convince our target markets about the importance of and need for such security  we do not know if this will result in the sale of our products 
to date  we have not entered into any commitments or contractual agreements for the delivery of the ssp solution suite products or components 
commercial customers may not select our products over those of our competitors 
if our ssp solution suite products or components do not achieve wide market acceptance and or if our pricing system is not competitive  our ability to earn revenues will be negatively impacted and our operating results will suffer 
our pulsar business is highly dependent on the availability of financial resources 
should we not be able to utilize our accounts receivable financing line  we will not have adequate cash available to pay vendors 
we have incurred defaults on our line in the past  are currently in default and anticipate we will continue to be in default on the line unless we are able to raise sufficient capital to pay debts and obligations as they become due 
should our financial source not waive the defaults  the financial source may not advance additional funds 
our auditor s opinion could adversely affect our stock price 
kpmg s audit report is a going concern opinion due to our need to obtain financing to satisfy forecasted cash requirements and the uncertainty over our ability to continue as a going concern 
this may affect our stock price and prevent us from obtaining funding 

table of contents our reliance on third party technologies for the development of the ssp solution suite products and our reliance on third parties for manufacturing may delay product launch  impair our ability to develop and deliver products or hurt our ability to compete in the market we have licensed the rights to use a broad array of technology components from third parties to develop the ssp solution suite and we face many risks associated with our reliance on third parties as follows a third party may develop or enable others to develop a similar solution to digital communication security issues as the ssp solution suite thereby eroding our market share  dependence on the patent protection of third parties may not afford us any control over the protection of the technologies we rely on  and  thus  if the patent protection of any of these third parties were compromised  our ability to compete in the market would also be impaired 
our inability to maintain and develop new relationships with partners and suppliers could impact our ability to obtain or sell our products including the ssp solution suite and result in a failure to generate revenues we plan to obtain certain of our products  have products built to specifications and sell products through alliance and supplier agreements 
while we will have direct sales channels  we currently anticipate that many of our products will be sold through alliance and supplier partners 
if alliance or supplier agreements are cancelled  modified or delayed  if alliance or supplier partners decide not to purchase our products or purchase only limited quantities of our products  or if we are unable to enter into additional alliance or supplier agreements  our ability to produce and sell our products and  therefore  our ability to generate revenues  could be adversely affected 
failure to license new technologies could impair our new product development our ssp solution suite is a collection of technologies  some of which are licensed from our alliance and supplier partners 
as a result  our ability to license new technologies from third parties is and will continue to be critical to our ability to offer a complete suite of products that meets customer needs and technological requirements 
some of our licenses do not run for the length of the patent for the technology 
we may not be able to renew our existing licenses on favorable terms  or at all 
if we lose the rights to a patented technology  we may need to stop selling certain of our products or redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage 
potential competitors could license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share for certain products 
if pki technology is compromised  our business would be adversely affected many of our products are based on pki technology 
the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user s private key  which depends in part  on the application of algorithms  or advanced mathematical factoring equations 
the occurrence of any of the following could result in a decline in demand for our data security products any significant advance in techniques for attacking pki systems  including the development of an easy factoring method or faster  more powerful computers  publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of private keys  and government regulation limiting the use  scope or strength of pki 
the company may not have access to additional financing 
the financing markets available to the company are limited due to a history of poor operating results 
should financing be available  the funds are expected to be at a high cost 
should our stated shareholders equity fall below million and our stock price trade below we may be de listed by nasdaq 
the listing requirement of nasdaq requires a company to maintain a minimum net stockholders equity and a minimum trading price 
at december  our shareholders equity was million should our shareholders equity be decreased by further losses and should our stock price fall below nasdaq may take step to de list our stock 

table of contents if use of the internet and other communication networks based on internet protocols does not continue to grow  demand for our products may not increase increased demand for our products depends in large part on the continued growth of the internet and internet protocol based networks and the widespread acceptance and use of these mediums for electronic commerce and communications 
because electronic commerce and communications over these networks are evolving  we cannot predict the size of the market and its sustainable growth rate 
a number of factors may affect market size and growth rate  including the use of electronic commerce and communications may not increase  or may increase more slowly than we expect  the internet infrastructure and communications services to support electronic commerce may not be able to continue to support the demands placed on it by continued growth  and the growth and reliability of electronic commerce and communications could be harmed by delays in development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or by increased governmental regulation 
we face intense competition from a number of sources the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and  as a result  we face significant competition from a number of different sources 
we may be unable to compete successfully as many of our competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
in addition  there are several smaller and start up companies with which we compete from time to time 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of consolidation in the information security technology and product reseller industries 
third parties could obtain access to our proprietary information or independently develop similar technologies because of the limited protection for our intellectual property our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
notwithstanding the precautions we take  third parties may copy or obtain and use our proprietary technologies  ideas  know how and other proprietary information without authorization or independently develop technologies similar or superior to our technologies 
in addition  the confidentiality and non competition agreements between us and our employees  distributors and clients may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
policing unauthorized use of our technologies and other intellectual property is difficult  particularly because the global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other data transmitted 
furthermore  the laws of other jurisdictions may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to raise additional capital to fund our future operations  our business will be harmed if we are unable to obtain additional capital to fund operations when needed  our product development efforts would be adversely affected  causing our business  operating results  financial condition and prospects to be materially harmed 
if we undertake or accelerate significant research and development projects for new products  we may require additional outside financing 
we expect that  to meet our long term needs  we will need to raise substantial additional funds through the sale of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt or through collaborative arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a significant negative effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and prospects 
we may not have enough cash available to conduct operations we have forecast operations for the year and project a need for cash in excess of million 
while the company closed a financing of million simultaneously to the filing this form k  this will not be adequate if we cannot access our accounts receivable credit line  receive extended terms from vendors  or raise additional capital 
additionally  if our sales are less than forecast or expenses higher than forecast  our cash needs may be higher than our current forecast 

table of contents if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products and service offerings could become obsolete if we are unable to modify existing products and develop new products that are responsive to changing technology and standards and meet customer needs in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be adversely affected 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technology  emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our products obsolete or less marketable 
the process of developing our products and services is extremely complex and requires significant continuing development efforts 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic relationships  our ability to develop and market our products would be adversely affected the loss of any of our existing strategic relationships  or the inability to create new strategic relationships in the future  could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
we depend upon our partners to develop and market products and to fund and perform their obligations as contemplated by our agreements with them 
we do not control the time and resources devoted by our partners to these activities 
these relationships may not continue or may require us to spend significant financial  personnel and administrative resources from time to time 
we may not have the resources available to satisfy our commitments  which may adversely affect our strategic relationships 
further  our products and services may compete with the products and services of our strategic partners 
this competition may adversely affect our relationships with our strategic partners  which could adversely affect our business 
we may face claims of infringement of proprietary rights there is a risk that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in addition  whether or not our products infringe on proprietary rights of third parties  infringement or invalidity claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us and we could incur significant expense in defending them 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may be required to modify our products or seek licenses for these intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to modify our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
our failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
a security breach of our internal systems or those of our customers could harm our business since we will provide security for internet and other digital communication networks  we may become a greater target for attacks by computer hackers 
we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective security protection for internet and other digital communication networks 
networks protected by our products may be vulnerable to electronic break ins 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
although we have not experienced any act of sabotage or unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network to date  if an actual or perceived breach of security for internet and other digital communication networks occurs in our internal systems or those of our end user customers  regardless of whether we caused the breach  it could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services 
this could cause us to lose customers  resellers  alliance partners or other business partners 
our business may be the target of cyber terrorist activities  or our revenues may be affected by the affect of cyber terrorist activities on our customers and or employees the full effects of the events on september  have not been determined 
the ripple effects throughout the economy may have an affect on our potential commercial customers  or their ability to purchase our products and services 
additionally  because we provide security products to the united states government  we may be targeted by cyber terrorist groups for the follow up activities threatened against the united states based targets 

table of contents doing business with the us government entails many risks  which could adversely affect us sales to us government agencies accounted for of our consolidated revenue for the twelve month period ended december  our sales to these agencies are subject to risks  including early termination of our contracts  disallowance of costs upon audit  and the necessity to participate in competitive bidding and proposal processes  which is costly  time consuming and may result in unprofitable contracts 
in addition  the government may be in a position to obtain greater rights with respect to our intellectual property than we would grant to other entities 
government agencies also have the power  based on financial difficulties or investigations of its contractors  to deem contractors unsuitable for new contract awards 
because we engage in the government contracting business  we have been and will be subject to audits and may be subject to investigation by governmental entities 
failure to comply with the terms of any of our governmental contracts could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties  as well as our suspension from future government contracts for a significant period of time  any of which could adversely affect our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include the length of our customer commitments  patterns of information technology spending by customers  the timing  size  mix and customer acceptance of our product and service offerings and those of our competitors  the timing and magnitude of required capital expenditures  and the need to use outside contractors to complete some assignments 
delays in deliveries from our suppliers or defects in goods or components supplied by our vendors could cause revenues to decline and adversely affect our operating results we rely on a limited number of vendors for certain components for the products we are developing that will comprise the ssp solution suite 
if we are unable to purchase these components  this may delay or prevent product shipments and result in a loss of sales 
in addition  if any components have undetected flaws  this could lead to unanticipated costs to repair or replace these parts 
this could cause a loss of revenue  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to replace any of our supply sources on economically 
table of contents advantageous terms 
further  if we experience price increases for the components for our products  we will experience declines in our gross margins 
a default under our secured credit arrangements could result in a foreclosure of our assets by our creditors all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure portions of our debt 
this means that if we default on our secured debt obligations  our indebtedness could become immediately due and payable and the lenders could foreclose on our assets 
our inability to find alternative suppliers of components may adversely affect our business some of the components incorporated into our products are produced by other vendors 
we currently purchase some of these components from a single supplier  thus presenting a risk that they may not be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future or at all 
our inability to develop alternative sources  if necessary  may require us to re design certain products  which could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could adversely affect our business 
we depend on key management personnel our success will depend largely on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
our business may be adversely affected if the services of any of our key personnel become unavailable to us 
there is a risk that these individuals will not continue to serve for any particular period of time 
while we have obtained a key person life insurance policy on the life of kris shah  our co chairman and co chief executive officer in the amount of million  this amount may not be sufficient to offset the loss of his service 
we have not yet obtained any such policies on the lives of our other key executives 
there is significant competition in our industry for highly skilled employees and our failure to attract and retain technical personnel would adversely affect our business we may not be able to attract or retain highly skilled employees 
our inability to hire or retain highly qualified individuals may impede our ability to develop  install  implement and service our software and hardware systems  customers and potential customers or efficiently conduct our operations  all of which may adversely affect our business 
the data security and networking solution industries are characterized by a high level of employee mobility  and the market for highly qualified individuals in the computer related fields is intense 
this competition means there are fewer highly qualified employees available to hire and the costs of hiring and retaining these individuals are high 
even if we are able to hire these individuals  we may be unable to retain them 
furthermore  there is increasing pressure to provide technical employees with stock options and other equity interests  which may dilute earnings per share 
potential product defects could subject us to claims from customers products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or result in failures when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite our product testing efforts and testing by current and potential customers  it is possible that errors will be found in new products or enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments 
the occurrence of product defects or errors could result in adverse publicity  delay in product introduction  diversion of resources to remedy defects  loss of or a delay in market acceptance  claims by customers against us  or could cause us to incur additional costs  any of which could adversely affect our business 
we may be exposed to potential liability for actual or perceived failure to provide required products or services 
table of contents because our customers rely on our products for critical security applications  we may be exposed to potential liability claims for damage caused to an enterprise as a result of an actual or perceived failure of our products 
an actual or perceived breach of enterprise network or data security systems of one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products or solutions  could adversely affect our business reputation 
furthermore  our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations in the performance of our services  or to do so in the time frame required by the customer  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  could result in a claim for substantial damages against us by the customer  discourage customers from engaging us for these services  and damage our business reputation 
in addition  as a professional services provider  a portion of our business involves employing people and placing them in the workplace of other businesses 
therefore  we are also exposed to liability for actions taken by our employees while on assignment 
our efforts to expand international operations are subject to a number of risks we are currently seeking to increase our international sales 
our inability to maintain or to obtain federal or foreign regulatory approvals relating to the import or export of our products on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to expand our international business 
additionally  our international operations could be subject to a number of risks  any of which could adversely affect our future international sales  including increased collection risks  trade restrictions  export duties and tariffs  uncertain political  regulatory and economic developments  and inability to protect our intellectual property rights 
our ability to produce the fort pki card on a timely and cost effective basis depends on the availability of a computer chip from a third party supplier  with whom we do not expect to maintain a supply agreement any inability to receive adequate supplies of atmel corporation s specially designed fort microprocessor would adversely affect our ability to sell the fort pki card 
we do not anticipate maintaining a supply agreement with atmel corporation for the fort microprocessor 
if atmel were unable to deliver the fort microprocessor for a lengthy period of time or terminated its relationship with us  we would be unable to produce the fort pki card until we could design a replacement computer chip for the fort microprocessor 
we anticipate this would take substantial time and resources to complete 
there are lawsuits pending against us and our wholly owned subsidiary  pulsar  which  if resolved against either us or pulsar  could adversely affect our business during the second quarter of microsoft notified the company regarding the alleged sales of unlicensed copies of microsoft office 
the software in question was purchased from a major computer hardware manufacturer and was resold to one of our customers in a package that included both hardware and software 
we are currently investigating the matter  and do not anticipate that the outcome will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may deter a takeover or a change in control or prevent an acquisition not approved by our board of directors  or that may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
governmental regulations affecting security of internet and other digital communication networks could limit the market for our products and services the united states and other foreign governments have imposed controls  export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  including encryption technology 
any additional governmental regulation of imports or exports or failure to obtain required export approval of our encryption technologies could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications and could limit the market for our products and services 
in addition  some foreign competitors are subject to less rigorous controls on exporting their encryption technologies and  as a result  they may be able to compete more effectively than us in the united states and in international security markets for internet and other digital communication networks 
in addition  certain governmental agencies  such as the federal communications commission  periodically issue regulations governing the conduct of business in telecommunications markets that may negatively affect the telecommunications industry and us 
a small number of stockholders  who include certain of our officers and directors  have the ability to control stockholder votes 
table of contents kris shah  marvin winkler  their affiliates and certain family members own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  have the ability to elect our directors and to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 
risks related to the aquisition the anticipated benefits of the aquisition may not be realized the anticipated benefits of the aquisition may not be realized due to a number of factors 
for example the anticipated management synergies and operational efficiencies of the aquisition may not be realized 
the anticipated increase in sales resulting from the combined efforts and combined distribution channels may not be realized 
we may not successfully integrate our business with biz  which could harm future earnings as a result of the aquisition  we face challenges in integrating our products and services with those of biz and this may continue for some time 
the integration might not be smooth or successful 
the integration of certain operations requires the dedication of management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from the day to day business of the combined company 
the business of the combined company may also be disrupted by employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration 
if this occurs  the anticipated advantages from the aquisition could be undermined and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our inability to integrate our management team with biz s management team may adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of the aquisition the success of the recent aquisition depends  in part  on our ability to unite the members of our respective management teams 
combining management from biz and our company has resulted in changes that affect all employees and operations 
differences in corporate cultures  strategies and management philosophies may strain employee relations 
additionally  if we encounter difficulties in integrating our management teams  our ability to realize the expected benefits from the aquisition  including management synergies  operational efficiencies and increased sales  could be adversely affected 
unanticipated costs relating to the recent aquisition could reduce our future earnings we believe that we reasonably estimated the likely costs of integrating our operations with the operations of biz and the incremental costs of operating as a combined company 
it is possible  however  that unexpected transaction costs  such as taxes  fees or professional expenses  or unexpected future operating expenses  such as increased personnel costs  as well as other types of unanticipated developments  could adversely impact our business and profitability 

table of contents aquisition related accounting charges may delay or reduce our profitability we have accounted for the acquisition of biz as a purchase 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price of biz is allocated to the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities that we acquired from biz 
the excess of the purchase price over biz s tangible net assets results in intangible assets for us that will have to be amortized over their useful lives with the exception of goodwill based on the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of in addition  we incurred an in process research and development charge of million in connection with our recent acquisition of biz 
as a result  we will incur accounting charges from the aquisition that may delay and reduce our profitability 
we also incurred charges of million to record the impairment in value of assets acquired 
recently issued fasb statements require us to evaluate the fair values of intangible assets and goodwill that we acquired in the aquisition that could result in significant charges to our earnings and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  business combinations  and statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the changes included in these statements require companies to perform impairment tests on goodwill and certain intangibles using a fair value approach rather than allowing companies to amortize goodwill and certain intangibles over their estimated useful lives 
we are now required to evaluate periodically whether intangible assets and goodwill that we acquired in the aquisition have fair values that meet or exceed the amounts recorded on our balance sheet 
we cannot predict whether or when there will be an impairment charge  or the amount of such charge  if any 
however  if the charge is significant  it could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  adoption of the sfas will eliminate recurring amortization charges that would remove certain intangible assets and goodwill from our balance sheet  and such amounts will remain permanently on our balance sheet unless future evaluations require us to record impairment charges
