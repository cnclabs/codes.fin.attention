the parties executed several ancillary agreements in connection with the asset purchase agreement in order to provide for the orderly transition of the gm unemployment compensation business and the employees of such business from gates  mcdonald company to us 
these ancillary documents included a transition services agreement  an intellectual property license agreement  a lease services agreement and an employee services agreement 
the frick company additionally  pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated as of march   we purchased all of the  issued and outstanding shares of common stock of james e 
frick  inc  d b a the frick company  a missouri corporation frick from the james e 
frick profit sharing and employee stock ownership plan the esop  and options to acquire  shares of frick s common stock held by the four principal optionholders 
frick provides unemployment cost control  unemployment claims handling  tax planning and related services and employment information verification services to a broad range of clients

services and products we provide services and systems that enable large corporations and government agencies to outsource operations that would otherwise be performed by their own human resources  benefits or payroll departments 
our software uses interactive web and interactive voice response software and other technologies to enable mortgage lenders  pre employment screening companies  employees and other authorized users to obtain employee human resources and payroll information  and allows employees and their managers to review and modify information in the human resources benefits and payroll management information systems on a self service basis 
our services and products fall within four general categories the work number services  unemployment cost management services  human resources and benefits application services and customer premises systems  including related maintenance and support 
the work number services responding to inquiries to verify employment and income information  printing and distributing pay stubs and annual w forms  and updating employee personal records are burdensome and time consuming tasks for employers and divert resources from managing their businesses 
the work number employment and income verification service and other payroll application services supported by the work number s database of employee records are designed to help employers save time and effort and reduce expenses associated with many of the administrative tasks required to support large workforces 
the work number 
mortgage lenders  pre employment screeners  social service agencies and other information verifiers often request organizations to verify employment and income information that has been provided by employees or former employees 
for example  the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation  leading purchasers of residential mortgages in the united states  usually require independent verification of employment and income data for the past two calendar years and a current payroll period in connection with mortgages that they will purchase 
in  we developed the work number as an outsourced service that enables employers to reduce the costs and resources to respond to verification requests  while empowering employees to control the release of personal information to third parties 
when an employer receives a request for income and employment data regarding an employee  the employer may direct the third party verifier to our web site or to a telephone number 
using the internet or a toll free telephone number  verifiers who subscribe to our service can confirm the employee s employment status and income for the past three years 
non subscribing verifiers can receive the same information through these methods using a credit card or through a telephone number 
the work number is designed to ensure that access to an employee s income data is available only to verifiers who have been pre authorized by the employee 
the work number can provide the following benefits to employers  employees and third party verifiers employers employees verifiers o reduces costs and resources otherwise o provides control over third party o decreases the opportunity for human spent responding to verification access to personal compensation error inquiries information o eases the administrative burden of o provides information without o reduces likelihood of fraud by the human resources and payroll staff requiring the cooperation or applicant by providing independent knowledge of co workers evidence directly to the verifier o lowers the risk of liability resulting o expedites the verification process  o expedites the verification process  from providing erroneous or so that transactions may occur more so that transactions may occur more unauthorized information to third quickly quickly parties we generate substantially all of the work number revenues from transaction based fees charged to mortgage lenders  pre employment screeners  credit issuers and other information verifiers for verification of income and employment information 
we also generate revenues from employer data conversion and ongoing maintenance fees 
as of march   the work number database contained approximately million employee records and had contracts to receive over million additional records 
the million records on line represent approximately million current and million former employees of over large employers  including federal  state and local government agencies 
the work number database is updated on an ongoing basis as employers electronically transmit data directly to us each payroll period 
employers typically contract to provide this data for specified periods  generally three years 
w express 
w express is a suite of services relating to the printing  distribution and correction of w wage and tax statement forms that we offer to existing clients of the work number and other large employers 
using data provided by employers  we distribute original w forms to employees and provide an automated process to enable employees to request corrections to their w forms and obtain additional copies via the internet or by telephone  instead of requiring direct interaction with the employer s payroll staff 
for employers  the primary benefits of our w express services include o simplifying the task of generating thousands of w statements within a narrow time period each year  o reducing staff and other resources that must be allocated to the production and distribution of w statements and the reissuance of corrected statements  and o automating the process for collecting correction requests 
we generate revenues from these services by charging clients a monthly fee which is based upon the number of employees 
we introduced w express in fiscal  and as of march  we held records of over five million employees of employers in our database  generally pursuant to multi year contracts 
epayroll 
epayroll is another outsourcing service that we offer to existing clients of the work number and other large employers 
epayroll is a suite of payroll self services applications that enable employees  via the internet or by telephone  to o receive pay statement information  o access current and historical payroll information  and o review and change direct deposit account information 
employers that send us electronic transmissions of their employees pay stubs and direct deposit data can reduce the amount of staff required to process routine employee payroll requests 
prior to the end of our fiscal year  we plan to introduce additional employee self service functions  such as the ability to complete and revise w withholding allowance forms and to manage personal information files 
we began offering epayroll in november  and our first clients began using the service in august we charge epayroll clients on a per employee per month basis  plus an initial set up fee  generally pursuant to multi year contracts 
fastime 
fastime is a service that we offer to temporary staffing agencies 
fastime allows employees  via the internet or by telephone  to enter time and payroll information 
fastime also allows the employees manager to review and approve time in an automated fashion 
we charge fastime clients on a per transaction basis  plus an initial application development fee  generally pursuant to multi year contracts 
unemployment cost management as a result of our recent acquisitions  we provide unemployment cost management services under the name uc express sm 
uc express is a complete suite of services designed to reduce the cost of processing unemployment claims by human resource departments and better manage the tax rate that employers are assessed for unemployment taxes 
uc express utilizes document imaging and web access to speed the processing of unemployment claims with the goal of uncovering inaccuracies in claims that have been filed with the states by separated employees 
uc express services are aimed at relieving hr departments of the administrative burden of managing unemployment claims

since uc express offers a choice of employer tax services  clients can take advantage of the services that are most effective in reducing their employment tax costs 
we charge clients fees on an annual contractual basis  generally billed monthly or quarterly  pursuant to multi year contracts 
certain contracts allow for additional charges if transaction activity exceeds a certain threshold 
certain unemployment tax planning contracts call for contingent fees based upon actual tax savings realized 
human resources and benefits application services for many human resources departments  benefits enrollment is a burdensome administrative task 
employees are generally permitted to enroll in or make changes to many types of benefit plans only at particular times during the year 
as a result  during such enrollment periods  a considerable amount of human resources and benefits department efforts are directed toward plan administration 
processing employee changes to information recorded under multiple providers benefits plans can require the completion  verification and handling of numerous paper based forms 
many companies find it necessary to hire temporary workers to manage the increased workload during these periods 
we offer our clients outsourcing solutions designed to reduce the resources and expenses associated with enrolling employees and administering ongoing participation in employee benefits programs 
our services include processing enrollments  producing personalized worksheets and confirmations  and delivering completed enrollments to employers and insurance carriers 
we support both open and ongoing enrollments year round 
to reach the growing number of internet users  our applications enable employees to complete enrollments via the internet  corporate portals and corporate intranets 
for those employees who prefer or need to use the telephone  options are available for processing enrollments via interactive voice response 
historically  we offered customer premises based software systems that were tailored to meet the needs of a particular employer 
since  we have been providing customized benefits enrollment services using the application service provider model 
in  we introduced echoice  our advanced benefits enrollment service combining the most popular features of our various customized benefits enrollment offerings that we can configure to meet each employer s particular needs 
we market echoice to organizations employing at least  people 
through echoice  employees can enroll in an employer s medical  dental and other health and welfare benefits programs and can make changes to their personal information and benefits elections  all by means of the internet or by telephone 
echoice enables employers to remove many of the time consuming aspects of administering their benefits programs  while providing benefits managers with an automated means of monitoring the enrollment process and performing certain plan management functions 
additionally  echoice allows employees to make enrollment decisions privately and assures that their elections will not be subject to human transcription error 
we generate revenues from echoice by charging clients on a per employee basis  generally pursuant to multi year contracts 
we generate revenues from our other human resources and benefits application services by charging clients an initial set up and development fee and monthly hosting and transactions fees  generally pursuant to multi year contracts 
customer premises systems and related maintenance and support from the early s until we offered our products and services exclusively through licensed software specifically developed for each customer  and installed these systems at the customer s site 
in we began to deliver benefits enrollment services as an application services provider 
in we began to de emphasize sales of customer premises systems  and in we discontinued sales to new customers 
we provide system enhancements to these customers and customer support days per week  hours per day  through a toll free hotline  email and our website 
we sold these systems under licenses and generate additional revenues by providing ongoing maintenance and support 
sales and marketing we employ a direct sales force in conjunction with strategic marketing alliances 
we use our direct sales force and strategic alliances to develop relationships with large employers  typically having over  employees 
in addition  we use our strategic alliances to help us to identify potential clients for the work number services among mid sized employers  typically having between  and  employees 
in our unemployment cost management business  our direct sales force sells to employers typically having over  employees 
direct sales force our sales and marketing effort has representatives located in us cities 
our sales and marketing effort relies on a team approach consisting of approximately professionals  including business development representatives  regional sales managers  product managers  account managers  product consultants and marketing personnel 
our business development representatives qualify companies as viable potential clients and establish appointments for our regional sales managers 
our regional sales managers are responsible for presenting our service offerings to prospective clients and negotiating for the sale of our services 
our product managers oversee product direction and provide sales assistance 
our account managers service existing clients and product consultants provide technical assistance to regional sales managers and prospective clients during the sales process 
our marketing personnel support the sales force at all levels 
strategic marketing alliances we have established alliances with leading providers of related human resources outsourcing services to build the database of records for the work number services relating to employees of mid sized employers and to increase our echoice client base 
these alliances include o hewitt associates llc hewitt associates is a global management consulting firm specializing in human resource services that has agreed to make the work number available to its clients 
for example  the work number is directly accessible by employees of hewitt s clients via a link to our website 
in exchange  we have agreed  among other things  to share revenue with hewitt resulting from its referrals 
o unifi network  a division of pricewaterhousecoopers unifi network provides integrated consulting and human resource services and has agreed to make available the work number to its clients in exchange for a share of the revenue generated by such activities 
o ceridian corporation ceridian is a national human resource outsourcing company that has agreed to make the work number and unemployment cost management services available to its clients in exchange for a share of the revenue generated by such activities 
o peoplesoft  inc peoplesoft  a leading provider of enterprise application software for use throughout large and mid sized organizations  has agreed to make the work number accessible to users of certain of its internet based business applications in exchange for a fixed fee and transaction based royalties 
these and other strategic marketing alliances such as towers perrin  convergys corporation and fringe benefits management company are generally reflected by non exclusive contractual arrangements that remain in effect for specified periods 
the success of these alliances will generally depend on the interest and commitment of these companies to promote and coordinate product development and marketing efforts with us  which is entirely at their discretion 
some of these companies maintain similar relationships with some of our competitors and compete directly with us in certain applications 
competition we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include o service and product quality  reliability and performance  o functionality and ease of use  o company reputation for integrity and confidentiality  o company financial strength  and o cost of the service or product 
our primary competitors relating to the work number services and unemployment cost management services are jon jay associates and the sheakley group of companies  which are unemployment cost management companies that also offer employment and income verification services and employers unity  which offers unemployment cost management services 
our human resources and benefits application services business competes with benefits consulting firms  including towers perrin llp and watson wyatt company  which provide comprehensive packages including benefit plan design  administration and consulting services  and automated enrollment services 
we also compete with providers of employee self service applications  including workscape  inc  automatic data processing  inc  peoplesoft  inc  and proact technologies corp 
additionally  we are aware of a number of employers who have established similar systems for their internal use and believe additional competitors may emerge 
we believe that we compete favorably in the key competitive factors that affect our markets for the work number services  our unemployment cost management services and our human resources and benefits application services 
however  our markets are still evolving and we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
many of our existing and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential clients and extensive knowledge of our markets 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors will emerge and rapidly acquire market share 
moreover  our competitors may consolidate with each other  or with other companies  giving them even greater capabilities with which to compete against us 
technology and product development each of our business lines is based on databases we construct and applications we build to access and manipulate data 
our unemployment cost management services are run on industry standard databases and applications 
all of our other services use a proprietary integrated visual development environment and software system known as talxware to build our applications for the work number and human resources and benefits applications services 
talxware is based on a microsoft windows nt operating system and is designed to support the creation and management of self service solutions 
we also license and integrate complementary technologies into our products including o speech recognition  o text to speech  o facsimile  o terminal emulation  and o client server database interfaces to be used in creating self service solutions 
we license these technologies from third party suppliers pursuant to non exclusive license or resale agreements or purchase under open market arrangements and then integrate into our products 
for example  we make quarterly royalty payments under a license agreement for various interactive voice response technologies in our application services businesses 
we have directed our development efforts toward enhancing and developing new offerings for the work number services and our human resources and benefits application services 
the most recent enhancements include extending the features and capabilities of the work number database  through our w express and epayroll paystub direct deposit services  as well as our echoice benefits enrollment offering 
we incurred product development costs of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of march   our total product development staff consisted of full time employees 
we believe that significant investments in product development are required to remain competitive 
proprietary rights our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary rights to our intellectual property 
we regard our trademarks  and our other intellectual property  as having significant value and being an important factor in the development and marketing of our products 
we currently rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and copyright laws and restrictions on disclosure to establish and protect our intellectual property 
we have obtained a trademark registration for the name talx and service mark registrations for the work number for everyone and the work number with the united states patent and trademark office 
talxware is one of our trademarks  and echoice  uc express  epayroll and w express are some of our service marks 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our officers  employees and consultants 
we also generally limit access to and distribution of our source code and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information 
however  these measures provide only limited protection of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may not have signed agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case  and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use technology that we regard as proprietary 
we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop techniques that are similar or superior to our technology 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of competitive advantage and decreased revenues 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business 
the interactive voice response industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
third parties have asserted in the past and  from time to time  may assert in the future  patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
in one case  we entered into a license agreement to use various interactive voice response and computer telephony integration technologies under which we made an initial payment and will pay future royalties 
further  we have not conducted a search to determine whether the technology included in our products infringes or misappropriates intellectual property held by other third parties 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which could relate to our products 
any claims asserting that our systems infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could significantly harm our business 
backlog we include in backlog executed contracts that require us to install and deliver either human resources and benefits application services or customer premises systems in a future period 
we had a total backlog in these businesses of approximately million at march   million at march  and million at march   with a one year backlog of approximately million at march   million at march  and million at march  substantially all of our backlog is attributable to human resources and benefits application services 
generally  contracts for delivery of human resources and benefits application services have terms ranging from one to three years and are not cancelable without payment of a specified termination penalty 
customer premises systems contracts are generally not cancelable at will 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of past or future operating results 
clients as of march   the work number database contained employee records from over clients  representing approximately million present and former employees 
additionally  as of that date  we had contracts with new clients to provide records of over million present and former employees in backlog 
these clients typically employ over  employees 
our clientele includes approximately two thirds of the fortune companies and a number of federal  state and local government agencies 
our clients operate in a wide variety of industries  including financial services  telecommunications services  retail  consumer products  health care  temporary services and government 
as of march   our unemployment cost management business had over  clients of various sizes and operated in a broad range of industries 
no client accounted for more than of total revenues in any of the fiscal years  or employees as of march   we employed full time and part time employees 
additionally  we leased full time and part time employees from gates mcdonald 
in conjunction with our acquisition of the unemployment compensation business of gates mcdonald  we entered into an employee services agreement whereby gates mcdonald agreed to lease their employees to us for a day period beginning march  we anticipate at the expiration of this agreement  substantially all employees will become employees of our company 
we have never had a work stoppage  and no employees are represented by a labor organization 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this form k in evaluating our company our future growth will depend on our ability to effectively integrate acquired companies and capitalize on anticipated cross selling opportunities on march   we acquired frick and the gm unemployment compensation business  in each case with the expectation that the transactions will result in certain benefits  including  without limitation  cost savings  operating efficiencies  cross selling opportunities  revenue enhancements and other synergies 
additionally  on july   we acquired ti  inc  an application service provider primarily for the staffing industry utilizing interactive voice response and internet technologies  with the expectation that the acquisition would expand and complement our application services business  enhance our revenues and increase market opportunities 
achieving the benefits of these transactions will depend in part upon the integration of the business of frick and the gm unemployment compensation business together with each other and the work number line of products and services in an efficient manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
further  the acquisition of ti was our first business acquisition as a public company  and the acquisitions of the frick company and the unemployment cost management business of gatesmcdonald are significantly larger than the ti acquisition 
the consolidation of operations will require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration processes could have a material adverse effect on the revenues  levels of expenses and operating results of the combined companies 
there can be no assurance that the combined companies will realize any of the anticipated benefits 
our future performance will be dependant on successful integration of acquisitions 
we expect a major portion of our growth to come from business acquisitions which we have recently consummated or which we may consummate in the future 
such acquisitions involve certain operational  legal and financial risks 
operational risks include the possibility that an acquisition does not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by our management  while we continue to incur operating expenses to provide the services formerly provided by the acquired company 
legal risks involve contract and regulatory issues that some employers may not consent to the transfer of ownership of their contracts by which the unemployment cost management services are provided  and that some states unemployment compensation commissions may require changes to powers of attorney by which the employer authorizes processing of claims 
in the event of any loss of employer customers or our inability to appear before state unemployment commissions  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
financial risks involve the incurrence of indebtedness as a result of the acquisition and the consequent need to service that indebtedness 
in addition  the issuance of stock in connection with acquisitions dilutes the voting power and may dilute the economic interests of existing shareholders 
in carrying out our acquisition strategy  we attempt to minimize the risk of unexpected liabilities and contingencies associated with acquired businesses through planning  investigation and negotiation  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so  nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing additional acquisitions on favorable terms 
our future growth is substantially dependent on our ability to increase the size and range of applications for the work number database 
in order to successfully grow our business  we will have to make the work number and related application services increasingly attractive to a greater number of large organizations  their employees and third party information verifiers 
to achieve this goal  we believe that we will need to increase the number of employee records contained in the work number database  the amount and type of information contained in those records and the number of applications that make use of those records 
our strategy for increasing the size of the work number database is based in part on strategic alliances with several providers of human resources outsourcing services 
our success will depend on the interest and commitment of these providers  which is entirely at their discretion 
some of these companies compete with us in certain applications 
our strategy is also based in part on strategic acquisitions of businesses with databases of employee information  such as our recent acquisitions of frick and the gm unemployment compensation business 
if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of employer clients  if we cannot persuade them to include a greater amount of information in the employee records they provide us  or if we fail to develop additional applications to use this information  we may not achieve our growth objectives 
our revenues from the work number may fluctuate in response to changes in the level of residential mortgage activity and interest rates 
a significant portion of our revenues from the work number depends on residential mortgage activity and interest rates 
we charge a fee for each request from mortgage lenders to verify employment and income information 
therefore  a decrease in residential real estate mortgage activity would reduce the number of transactions per record  which could adversely affect our revenues 
if residential mortgage activity declines  whether due to increases in mortgage interest rates or otherwise  our revenues and profitability could be harmed 
the market for the work number depends in part on the requirements established by purchasers in the secondary mortgage market  and our revenues and profitability would be significantly harmed if these requirements were relaxed or eliminated 
we believe that residential mortgage lenders are among the most active users of the work number 
they utilize our services to verify employment  income and related information 
the demand for this verification is driven in part by the requirements of the federal national mortgage association  which is also known as fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation  which is also known as freddie mac  leading purchasers of residential mortgages in the united states 
these agencies currently require specific information  including independent verification of employment and income data for the past two calendar years and a current payroll period in connection with mortgages they purchase having a loan to value in excess of 
accordingly  most lenders seek this information from mortgage applicants 
if fannie mae or freddie mac were to further reduce the requirement for employment and income data or eliminate the requirement for independent verification thereof  our revenues and profitability would be significantly harmed 
if we are unable to maintain the accuracy and confidentiality of employee information in the work number and our other databases  we may face significant claims and our reputation would be harmed 
the work number services and our human resources and benefits application services depend on the accuracy of highly confidential employment and income history and other information which employers provide to us and which we convert for use in the work number and our other services 
although we have a number of protective measures in place  any inaccuracies in such information whether in the recording of such information  the unauthorized access to information  or otherwise or our inability to keep such information confidential  may give rise to claims against us and adversely affect market acceptance of the work number and our other services 
our financial condition  results of operations and reputation may be significantly harmed if any asserted claims were ultimately decided against us 
if the fair credit reporting act applies to the work number services  our business and revenues will be harmed 
the fair credit reporting act  which we refer to as the fcra  may apply to the work number services  which would have an adverse impact on us 
the fcra applies to consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information 
we believe the work number services do not cause us to be a consumer reporting agency and that the fcra does not apply to the work number services 
unlike consumer reporting agencies  we receive all of the information in the work number database regarding an employee from one source the employer and we do not evaluate an employee s creditworthiness 
further  when contracting for the work number services  employers name us as their agent 
the fcra exempts from its reach communications of a party solely related to experiences of the consumer and the person making the report  such as an employer s report on its experience with its employee 
we believe that as an agent of employers  we are not a consumer reporting agency 
further  some rulings on the application of fcra have exempted businesses which  like the work number services  simply pass along information gathered 
while we believe no controlling legal precedent exists  consumers or the federal trade commission  which enforces the fcra  could take the position that the fcra does apply to us and seek to require us to comply with the fcra and seek penalties and damages 
among other provisions  the fcra requires that a consumer reporting agency determine that there be a permissible purpose before disclosing a consumer report and furnish certain notices and information in writing to consumers as consumer reports are used 
if required  we would have difficulty complying with these procedures  the work number services are designed to operate via interactive voice response and the internet  instead of paper 
further  we might have to eliminate certain types of transactions  resulting in loss of revenue 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the ultimate impact on us in the event the fcra were deemed to apply to the work number services 
privacy legislation or interpretations of existing laws could restrict our business 
personal privacy has become a significant issue in the united states 
some commentators  privacy advocates and government bodies have recommended limitations on  or taken actions to limit  the use of personal information by those collecting this information 
for example  in  congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act  which contains provisions protecting the privacy of consumer non public personal information collected by financial institutions 
this legislation may limit our ability to disclose data received from financial institutions for the work number services 
additionally  federal privacy regulations relating to the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information were recently issued by the department of health and human services pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of these privacy regulations could impose additional costs and could limit our use and disclosure of information in connection with our benefits enrollment and similar services 
some states have also enacted consumer and health information privacy protection laws 
although we release income information only when authorized by the employee  if new statutes or regulations were adopted that restricted our business  or existing statutes or regulations were deemed to apply to us  we may be required to change our activities and revise or eliminate our services  which could significantly harm our revenues and operations 
interruptions to our computer network or telephone operations could significantly harm our revenues and industry reputation 
significant portions of our operations depend on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our data processing center against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion and other events 
we have data processing centers located in st 
louis  missouri  columbus  ohio and plano  texas which areas have historically been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as floods  earthquakes and tornadoes 
we back up software and related data files regularly and store the back up files off site nearby 
we cannot assure you that these measures will eliminate the risk of extended interruption of our operations 
we also rely on local and long distance telephone companies to provide dial up access  internet and corporate intranet access to our services 
we have not established an alternative disaster recovery facility  which would serve to protect us from losses of employee record information due to damage to our data storage facilities 
any damage or failure that interrupts our operations or destroys some or all of our database of employee records could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and industry reputation 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
our revenues  margins and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors 
for the work number  these factors include residential mortgage activity and interest rate levels 
we expect revenues generated from our new w express service will be particularly affected by seasonality  as revenues relating to the implementation and use of these services will primarily be earned in our fourth fiscal quarter 
similarly  revenues from our benefits enrollment services tend to be greater in the last two quarters of each calendar year  which correspond to our second and third fiscal quarters 
other factors that can cause our operating results to fluctuate include o new product introductions or announcements by us or our competitors  o market acceptance of new services  o the hiring and training of additional staff  o the length of the sales cycle and the timing of transactions with clients  and o general economic conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our level of total revenue or our historical rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that  in some future quarters  our operating results will fall below our targets and the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our future growth also depends on our ability to successfully develop and market current and future human resources and benefits application services 
the market for human resources and benefits application services is still evolving 
our success will depend upon our ability to develop applications that provide attractive outsourcing opportunities and to successfully market these products to large employers 
there are numerous other companies  including traditional consulting firms and other application service providers  that provide outsourcing services in these areas 
prior to contracting for services  employers typically consider several types of human resources and benefits services  as well as whether to outsource at all 
additionally  general and company specific economic conditions  internal policy making procedures and other factors can delay and add uncertainty to the process of marketing to potential clients 
if we are unable to develop and sell human resources and benefits application services on an ongoing basis  our revenues and results of operations may suffer 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new application services and enhanced functionality to keep pace with rapid technological changes that characterize our markets  our results of operations would be significantly harmed 
the application services industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and our future success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with technological developments 
in particular  the market for self service applications through the internet and corporate intranets using browser software is rapidly evolving 
to remain competitive  we must continually change and improve our services and products in response to changes in operating systems  application software  computer and telephony hardware  communications  database and networking systems  programming tools and computer language technology 
additionally  we must also introduce new application services and add functionality to existing services in response to changing market conditions and client demand  particularly as benefit plan designs change and new types of plans are introduced 
the development of new  technologically advanced services and products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends 
if we are unable  for technical or other reasons  to develop and market new application services or enhancements to existing services in a timely and cost effective manner  or if new application services do not achieve market acceptance  we could lose revenues and our competitive position could suffer 
we depend on third party software and hardware  which exposes us to disruption if those products are no longer supported or develop defects 
our services and products involve integration with both operating systems and products developed by others 
if any third party software or hardware  such as microsoft windows nt or oracle database software  becomes unavailable for any reason  fails to integrate with our products or fails to be supported by their respective vendors or to operate properly  we would have to redesign our products 
we cannot assure you that we could accomplish any redesign in a cost effective or timely manner 
further  if third parties release new versions of these systems or products before we develop products compatible with such new releases  demand for our services and products might decline  thereby harming our revenues and profitability 
we believe that if any supplier agreement expires or is canceled or otherwise terminated  or if a third party supplier refuses to sell to us  we could locate any number of different suppliers 
however  it would require a significant amount of time to integrate the relevant technology from the new supplier  which would result in a significant delay in our ability to offer the particular enhancement 
we could also experience difficulties integrating the new supplier s technology with our products 
we cannot assure you we could accomplish any such integration in a cost effective manner 
significant delays in the offering of service or produce enhancements due to integration of technology from new suppliers could significantly harm our revenues and profitability 
our services and products may contain defects or lack adequate security which may cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
as a result of their complexity  application services and hardware and software products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite testing by us and our clients  errors will not occur in services and systems after implementation 
the occurrence of such errors could result in loss or delay in market acceptance of our services or products  which could significantly harm our revenues and our reputation 
internet or other users could access without authorization or otherwise disrupt our internet and corporate intranet applications 
such unauthorized access and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of our clients  which could result in significant liability to us  could cause the loss of existing clients and could discourage potential new clients 
because of intense competition for technical personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel on a cost effective basis 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to identify  hire  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense  particularly in our geographic area 
in addition  employees may leave our company and subsequently compete against us 
our failure to attract and retain these qualified employees could significantly harm our ability to develop new products and maintain customer relationships 
moreover  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may be subject to such claims as we seek to retain or hire qualified personnel  some of whom may currently be working for our competitors 
some of these claims may result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
other parties have asserted in the past  and may assert in the future  patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
for example  we recently entered into a license to use various interactive voice response and computer telephony technologies that required us to make an initial payment and pay future royalties 
further  we have not conducted a search to determine whether the technology we have in our products infringes or misappropriates intellectual property held by other third parties 
we cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could significantly harm our results of operations 
any claims  with or without merit  could o be time consuming  o result in costly litigation  o divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  o require us to develop alternative technology  thereby resulting in delays and the loss or deferral of revenues  o require us to cease marketing application services containing the infringing intellectual property  o require us to pay substantial damage awards  o damage our reputation  or o require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our revenues  results of operations and competitive position would be harmed 
our failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our results of operations and reputation 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary rights to our intellectual property 
we currently rely on a combination of trade secret  trademark and copyright laws to establish and protect our intellectual property 
to date  we have relied primarily on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary processes and know how 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our officers  employees and consultants 
we also generally limit access to and distribution of our source code and the disclosure and use of our other proprietary information 
however  these measures provide only limited protection of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may not have signed agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case  and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances 
further  we have not included copyright notices on all of our copyrightable intellectual property 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in the loss of one or more competitive advantages and decreased revenues 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing trade secret  copyright  patent and trademark laws afford us only limited protection 
others may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to deter others from developing similar technologies 
further  monitoring the unauthorized use of our products and other proprietary rights is difficult 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation 
we face competition from a broad range of companies  including large and well established firms 
the markets for our services and products are extremely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we consider the primary competitors to the work number and the unemployment cost management business to be jon jay associates and the sheakley group of companies  which are unemployment cost management providers offering employment and income verification services  and employers unity  which offers unemployment cost management services 
additionally  we are aware of a number of employers who have established similar systems for their internal use and believe additional competitors may emerge 
our human resources and benefits application services business competes with benefits consulting firms  including towers perrin llp and watson wyatt company  which provide comprehensive packages including benefit plan design  administration and consulting services and automated enrollment services  and with providers of employee self service applications  including workscape  inc  automatic data processing  inc  peoplesoft  inc and proact technologies corp 
many of these companies and other potential competitors have greater name recognition  larger installed client bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
any such competitor could use those resources to compete effectively against us 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could significantly harm our results of operations 
additionally  we may be required to increase spending in response to competition in order to pursue new market opportunities or to invest in research and development efforts  and  as a result  our operating results in the future may be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures we face will not significantly harm our results of operations 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and missouri law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefits to our shareholders 
a number of provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and missouri law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
these provisions o provide for a classified board of directors  o limit the right of shareholders to remove directors or change the size of the board of directors  o limit the right of shareholders to fill vacancies on the board of directors  o limit the right of shareholders to act by written consent and to call a special meeting of shareholders or propose other actions  o provide that the bylaws may be amended only by the majority vote of the board of directors and shareholders will not be able to amend the bylaws without first amending the articles of incorporation  o require a higher percentage of shareholders than would otherwise be required to amend  alter  change or repeal certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  o authorize the issuance of preferred stock with any voting rights  dividend rights  conversion privileges  redemption rights and liquidation rights  and other rights  preferences  privileges  powers  qualifications  limitations or restrictions as may be specified by our board of directors  without shareholder approval  and o restrict specified types of business combinations and control share acquisitions  as well as regulate some tender offers 
these provisions may o have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in our control despite possible benefits to our shareholders  o discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock  and o harm the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our shareholders 
our stock price is highly volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile  ranging from a high of per share to a low of during the months ended june  the price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations due to factors including o actual or anticipated variations in our operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new services or contracts by us or our competitors  o developments with respect to patents  copyrights or proprietary rights  o changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  o conditions and trends in outsourcing of unemployment cost management  human resources  benefits and payroll services  and o general economic and market conditions 
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies 
often these fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performances of those companies 
broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
declines in the market price of our common stock could also harm employee morale and retention  our access to capital and other aspects of our business 
because our share price is volatile  we may be the target of securities litigation  which is costly and time consuming to defend 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  shareholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies 
we are currently defending against such a claim 
see item legal proceedings 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which would significantly harm our profitability and reputation 
these market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions or international currency fluctuations  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements and other financial information included in this form k 
overview our software and services consist of the work number services  unemployment cost management services  human resources and benefits application services  the sale of customer premises systems  and maintenance and support services related to those systems 
the technologies we use include both interactive web and interactive voice response 
the work number services include o the work number  our leading employment and income verification service  o w express  our suite of w payroll services  o epayroll  our suite of payroll self service applications  and o fastime  our automated timesheet collection and approval services 
we derive substantially all our revenues from the work number from fees charged to mortgage lenders and other verifiers for verification of employment history  including the past three years of income history of participating employers current and former employees 
we derive additional revenues from ongoing maintenance fees charged to employers and one time conversion fees from new employers 
our revenues from w express and epayroll represent fees charged to clients on a monthly fee basis which is based upon the number of employees 
we first introduced w express in fiscal  with no meaningful revenues generated until the fourth quarter of fiscal our first clients began using epayroll in our second fiscal quarter of our revenues from fastime include fees from establishment of the service and fees based on the number of transactions 
costs of revenues related to the work number services consist of telecommunications services  personnel  equipment and capitalized software amortization 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we provide unemployment cost management services under the name uc express 
these services include unemployment insurance claims processing and unemployment tax planning and management to a broad range of employers 
we charge clients fees on an annual contractual basis  generally billed monthly or quarterly  pursuant to multi year contracts 
certain contracts allow for additional charges if transaction activity exceeds a specified threshold 
certain unemployment tax planning contracts call for contingent fees based upon actual tax savings realized 
costs of revenues related to uc express consist primarily of personnel and equipment 
our human resources and benefits application services business consists principally of benefits enrollment services that offer employers and employees a broad range of automated features 
in  we began offering echoice  our advanced benefits enrollment service that provides these features in a standardized package 
we maintain a system on our premises that contains a customer database and receives incoming requests for access to the information 
revenues from human resources and benefits application services include fees derived from establishment of the service and fees based on the number of employees or transactions 
costs of revenues related to our human resources and benefits application services consist of personnel  equipment  telecommunications services and capitalized software amortization 
our customer premises systems business provides interactive web  interactive voice response and computer telephony integration software and services that enable an organization s users to access  input and update information without human assistance 
we recognize revenue from hardware sales and software licenses upon shipment 
revenues from implementation services relating to our customer premises systems are recognized by the contract method of accounting using percentage of completion for larger  more complex systems and the completed contract method for smaller systems 
with the market s acceptance of our application services delivery method  in fiscal we began to de emphasize sales of customer premises systems and in fiscal discontinued sales to new clients 
however  we continue to provide maintenance and support services with respect to installed customer premises systems 
revenues from maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
costs of revenues related to our customer premises systems consist of personnel  capitalized software amortization and hardware costs of goods sold 
costs of revenues related to maintenance and support consist primarily of personnel costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  capitalized software and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies include our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from the work number are recognized in the period that they are earned  from transaction fees charged to users for verifications of employment history and income  and from monthly maintenance and employer conversion fees 
revenues from our unemployment cost management services  called uc express  are recognized in the period that they are earned  evenly over the life of the contract 
transaction fees are recorded as the services are provided 
revenue which is contingent upon achieving certain performance criteria is recognized when those criteria are met 
we recognize hardware and software license revenue upon shipment based on vendor specific objective evidence 
application services revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenues for customization services are recognized by the contract method of accounting using percentage of completion for larger  more complex systems and the completed contract method for smaller systems 
revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
deferred revenue represents the unearned portion of uc express and maintenance fees 
intangible asset valuations in connection with the acquisitions of ti  frick and the gm unemployment compensation business  talx acquired certain identifiable intangible assets 
these assets were recorded in accordance with the financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 business combinations 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements for more information about sfas no 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
related to all three of our acquisitions during fiscal effective april   we will adopt the financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 any impairment loss identified upon adoption of this standard will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combinations will not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the acquired identifiable intangible assets of approximately million include software  customer base and covenant not to compete 
software of  has an estimated useful life of three years 
customer base acquired in the ti acquisition of  have an estimated useful life of ten years and customer base of  acquired in the frick and gm unemployment compensation business acquisitions have an estimated useful life of years 
customer records of  have an estimated useful life of years 
we are currently in the process of obtaining third party valuations of identifiable intangible assets  thus the values ascribed to these assets are subject to refinement 
capitalized software software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is achieved  after which they are capitalized on a product by product basis 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  generally three years 
amortization of capitalized software development costs starts when the product is available for general release to clients 
all capitalized software assets are reviewed as of each balance sheet date for impairment 
upon determination of any impairment  the asset is written down to the appropriate value in the period that the impairment is determined 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
if management were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 any impairment loss identified upon adoption of this standard is recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
any impairment loss incurred subsequent to initial adoption of sfas no 
is recorded as a charge to current period earnings 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
related to all three of our acquisitions during fiscal  and will have adopted sfas no 
effective april  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combinations will not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis 
because we did not have goodwill prior to the ti acquisition  the impact of implementing sfas no 
will not be significant to the company 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires businesses to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for our fiscal year beginning april  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective april  for the company 
we are reviewing the provisions of sfas no 
and do not anticipate that the adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations the following tables set forth revenues and gross margin  the gross margin percentage by revenue category  and certain items from our statement of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended march  in thousands revenues the work number services    unemployment cost management services human resources and benefits application services    customer premises systems    maintenance and support    total revenues    gross margin the work number services    unemployment cost management services human resources and benefits application services    customer premises systems   maintenance and support    inventory write down total gross margin    years ended march  gross margin percentage by revenue category the work number services unemployment cost management services human resources and benefits application services customer premises systems maintenance and support years ended march  percentage of total revenues revenues the work number services unemployment cost management services human resources and benefits application services customer premises systems maintenance and support total revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses operating income other income  net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense income tax expense earnings from continuing operations discontinued operations  net net earnings fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from the work number services increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to an increase in the number of employment records in the database and related transaction volume  new clients gained from continued marketing to employers and verifiers  the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of ti in the second quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  an increase in pricing during the year 
revenues from unemployment cost management services for fiscal includes five days of revenue from our march  acquisitions of the frick company and the unemployment cost management business of gatesmcdonald 
revenues from human resources and benefits application services increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to the addition of new clients seeking to outsource their non core functions  offset by client attrition 
this growth was less than planned  due the poor economic conditions experienced during the second and third quarters of fiscal revenues from customer premises systems decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is due to a shift in our focus away from selling in house systems to our human resources and benefits application services 
revenues from maintenance and support related to the customer premises systems decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting the support provided to a shrinking installed base as we shifted our strategy toward providing similar solutions through application services

revenues from human resources and benefits application services are seasonally higher during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to the nature of the services being provided 
our second and third fiscal quarters correspond to the third and fourth calendar quarters 
we believe many of our clients permit employees to update their benefit choices only annually  in most cases during the last calendar quarter 
revenues generated from our w express service are particularly affected by seasonality and are principally earned in our fourth fiscal quarter 
our revenues have increased on a quarter by quarter comparison in fiscal over fiscal due to the addition of new clients seeking to outsource non core functions

our capital expenditures  principally purchases of computer equipment  were million in fiscal at march   we had no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facilities and operating leases  but would expect capital expenditures to increase during the next two fiscal years  as we integrate the operations of our acquisitions 
in november  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our stock in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions over the following two year period 
in november  this plan was extended to november  and the number of shares was increased to one million 
we repurchased  shares for million during fiscal cumulative shares repurchased amount to  share amounts are reported on a pre dividend basis 
except for the  shares remaining in the treasury at march   all shares repurchased have been reissued in connection with employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases

in addition  if william w 
canfield ceases serving as our chief executive officer during the first months after closing  and we do not retain a substitute satisfactory to the lenders within days  then we are required to repay all outstanding loans  including both the term loan and revolving credit facility
