management s discussion and anaylsis results of operations for the years ended december  and net interest income 
net interest income for was billion compared to million for  or an increase of 
the increase in net interest income in was due to the full year effect of the interest earning assets from the new england acquisition  internal asset growth  and by the significant decline in interest rates throughout the new england acquisition added billion to average loans and billion to average deposits replacing higher cost fhlb borrowings in net interest margin net interest income divided by average interest earning assets was for compared to for interest on interest earning deposits was million for compared to million for the average balance of interest earning deposits was million with an average yield of for compared to an average balance of million with an average yield of for the high yields of were the result of an outsourced accounts payable process whereby a third party vendor performed check processing and reconcilement functions for sovereign s disbursement accounts and paid sovereign interest on disbursed funds during the two to three day float period  effectively producing interest income with no corresponding asset balance 
sovereign terminated this agreement in interest on investment securities available for sale was million for compared to million for the increase in interest income was due to the increase in average investment securities available for sale from billion in to billion in  offset by lower interest income on investment securities available for sale due to declining interest rates

the decline in average yields year to year is due to the decrease of market rates during the year of basis points 
over of our loan portfolio reprices monthly or more frequently 
interest on total deposits was million for compared to million for the average balance of total deposits was billion with an average cost of for compared to an average balance of billion with an average cost of for the increase in the average balance was due primarily to the full year effect of the new england acquisition  which added over billion to average deposits during the decrease in average cost in mainly reflects the decrease in deposit rates due to market conditions

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is based upon credit loss experience and an estimation of losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million for the higher provisioning was required because of the higher balance of average loans  increased levels of non performing and potential problem loans  and current economic conditions 
the overall allowance as a percentage of loans outstanding increased from in to in as sovereign continues to place emphasis on commercial and consumer lending  management will regularly evaluate the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and increase its loan loss provision as is necessary 
sovereign s net charge offs for were million and consisted of charge offs of million and recoveries of million 
this compares to net charge offs of million consisting of charge offs of million and recoveries of million 
sovereign s increased level of commercial charge offs in was related primarily to deterioration in a segment of the portfolio concentrated in cash flow based enterprise value lending  primarily in syndicated multi bank credits that were originated by other banks and participated in by sovereign 
the increase in consumer charge offs was due to a increase in consumer loans during and a general deterioration in the economic environment resulting in higher personal bankruptcies and larger incidences of consumer loan losses

for  amount includes million of loan loss allowance established as part of the fleet auto acquisition  partially off set by net charge offs of million related to first state for the three month period ended december  resulting from the differing fiscal year end of first state 
sovereign s policy for charging off loans varies with respect to the category of loans and specific circumstances surrounding each loan under consideration 
consumer loans and residential real estate mortgage loans are generally charged off when deemed to be uncollectible or days past due  whichever comes first 
charge offs of commercial loans are made on the basis of management s ongoing evaluation of non performing loans 
other income 
total other income was million for compared to million for several factors contributed to the increase in other income as discussed below 
consumer fees were million for compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a favorable shift from time to core deposit products along with the full year s impact of the new england acquisition 
additionally  in the company aggressively promoted demand deposit products  which  in exchange for favorable minimum balance requirements and convenience for the customer  generally produce higher fee revenues than time deposit products 
commercial fees were million for compared to million in this increase was due to growth in both commercial loans and core deposits during the year augmented by a full year s impact of the new england acquisition

income from bank owned life insurance boli was million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to an additional investment in boli of million which was made during miscellaneous income increased million to million in due primarily to a million gain related to the sale of branches located in southern new jersey  delaware and eastern pennsylvania 
the impact of the sale is not expected to significantly impact future results 
net gains on sales of investment securities and related derivatives were million for  compared to a net loss of million for this improvement was due primarily to second and third quarter balance sheet deleveraging transactions in which sovereign sold billion of available for sale mortgage backed securities  resulting in losses of million 
periodically  sovereign will sell certain investment securities and use the proceeds to pay off short term advances 
upon repayment of the short term advances  related swaps hedging these instruments may be terminated 
in these instances of balance sheet deleveraging  such hedging gains or losses are netted against the offsetting security loss or gain 
net gains losses on investments were million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively and net gains losses on related derivative contracts were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of available for sale investment securities have little impact on stockholders equity as unrealized gains and losses on these securities are recognized as market values change and are recorded as an increase or decrease in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity in accordance with sfas general and administrative expenses 
total operating general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million in  which exclude merger related and other special charges in as described below  or an increase of

other operating expenses

management expects that the absolute dollar amount of these tax exempt items will not change significantly during  however  the percent effect of these non taxed items on the effective rate will vary in the future depending on the level of pretax income 
the effective tax rate for and is not meaningful due to the high proportion of permanent tax differences  including certain one time tax benefits included in operating earnings  in relation to the recorded pretax income loss

see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sovereign s policies concerning valuation and impairment assessment for such interests as well as a discussion of the assumptions used and sensitivity to changes in those assumptions 
sovereign does not provide contractual legal recourse to third party investors that purchase debt or equity securities issued by the qspes beyond the credit enhancement inherent in sovereign s subordinated interests in the qspes 
however  should the performance of the underlying loans held by those qspes deteriorate to a level that our retained subordinated interests are insufficient to collateralize the qspe securities held by third party investors  sovereign may decide to provide the qspes with additional credit enhancements to reduce the third party investors risk of loss  although it is not contractually required to do so 
if management decides not to provide additional credit enhancements in such a situation  it could adversely impact the availability and pricing of future transactions 
the performance of the underlying collateral in all of sovereign s transactions at december  is sufficient such that management believes it is unlikely sovereign will need to provide additional credit enhancements to these transactions in the future 
securitizations consolidated in sovereign s consolidated balance sheet 
in a transaction consummated in november  sovereign accessed the liquidity of international markets and transferred million of indirect automobile loans to spes in a financing transaction that does not qualify as a sale of assets under sfas  and therefore has consolidated both the assets transferred to the spes and the debt and minority interests issued by the spes in its consolidated balance sheet 
at december   sovereign had million of debt and million of minority interest reflected on its consolidated balance sheet related to consolidated spes 
additionally  sovereign will periodically sell qualifying mortgage loans to fhlmc  gnma  and fnma in return for mortgage backed securities issued by those agencies 
sovereign reclassifies the net book balance of the loans sold to such agencies from loans to investment securities held to maturity and available for sale 
for those loans sold to the agencies in which sovereign retains servicing rights  sovereign allocates the net book balance transferred between servicing rights and investment securities based on their relative fair values 
minority interests 
in the financing transaction consummated in november  sovereign received million from the sale of ownership interests in consolidated spes to outside investors 
the spes were formed to issue debt and equity interests as parts of a securitization transaction which raised a total of million for sovereign 
the controlling interests in the spes are reflected as minority interests in sovereign s consolidated balance sheet  along with the indirect automobile loans and asset backed notes as the entire transaction is considered a financing in accordance with sfas on august   sovereign received approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of million of series a noncumulative preferred interests in sovereign real estate investment trust sreit  a subsidiary of sovereign bank which holds primarily residential real estate loans 
the preferred stock was issued at a discount  which is being amortized over the life of the preferred shares using the effective yield method 
the preferred shares may be redeemed at any time on or after may   at the option of sovereign subject to the approval of the ots 
under certain circumstances  the preferred shares are automatically exchangeable into preferred stock of sovereign bank 
the offering was made exclusively to institutional investors  however  sovereign expects to register the sreit preferred shares so that they can be offered to other investors 
the proceeds of this offering were principally used to repay corporate debt 
credit risk management extending credit exposes sovereign to credit risk  which is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan 
sovereign manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards  guidelines and limitations established by the board of directors 
written loan policies establish underwriting standards  lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and other key credit attributes  have also been established 
loan approval authority ranges from the individual loan officer to the board of directors loan committee 
in addition to being subjected to the judgment and dual approval of experienced loan officers and their managers  loans over a certain dollar size also require the co approval of credit officers independent of the loan officer to ensure consistency and quality in accordance with sovereign s credit standards 
the retail loan review group and the commercial asset review group conduct ongoing  independent reviews of the lending process to ensure adherence to established policies and procedures  monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations  provide objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and ensure that proper documentation exists 
the results of these periodic reviews are reported to the asset review committee  and to the board of directors of both sovereign and sovereign bank 
sovereign also maintains a watch list for certain loans identified as requiring a higher level of monitoring by management because of one or more factors  such as economic conditions  industry trends  nature of collateral  collateral margin  payment history  or other factors 
commercial loan credit quality is strong but is under a high level of scrutiny by line management  credit officers and the independent commercial asset review group  due to current economic conditions 
at december   sovereign s loan portfolio was residential  consumer and commercial 
at december   sovereign s loan portfolio was residential  consumer and commercial 
this shift in portfolio composition reflects increased emphasis in commercial and consumer lending 
management believes this shift in loan composition brings higher yields and higher inherent credit risk 
the following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses sovereign s strategies for managing the related credit risk 
management s discussion and analysis commercial loans 
credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing and expected economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk sovereign is willing to assume 
to manage credit risk when extending commercial credit  sovereign focuses on both assessing the borrower s capacity and willingness to repay and on obtaining sufficient collateral 
commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets and by personal guarantees 
commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the pennsylvania  new jersey  and new england market areas and are secured by developed real estate at conservative loan to values and often by a guarantee of the borrower 
management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry do not exist 
consumer loans 
credit risk in the direct and indirect consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider debt to income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and  if secured  collateral values 
in the home equity loan portfolio  combined loan to value ratios are generally limited to or credit insurance is purchased to limit exposure 
other credit considerations may warrant higher combined loan to value ratios for approved loans 
the auto loan portfolio is characterized by high credit scoring borrowers and strong payment performance 
the portion of the consumer portfolio at december   which is secured by real estate  vehicles  deposit accounts or government guarantees comprises of the entire consumer portfolio 
residential loans 
sovereign originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans which are secured by the underlying family residential property 
credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower  including debt to equity ratios  credit scores  and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance  unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the federal  state or local government 
sovereign also utilizes underwriting standards which comply with those of the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or the federal national mortgage association fnma 
credit risk is further reduced since a portion of sovereign s fixed rate mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse 
collections 
sovereign closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality 
collection efforts begin within days after a loan payment is missed by attempting to contact all borrowers and to offer a variety of loss mitigation alternatives 
if these attempts fail  sovereign will proceed to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses 
while liquidation and recovery efforts continue  officers continue to work with the borrowers  if appropriate  to recover all monies owed to sovereign 
sovereign monitors delinquency trends at   and days past due 
these trends are discussed at the monthly asset review committee meetings 
minutes from these meetings are submitted to the board of directors of sovereign bank 
non performing assets 
at december   sovereign s non performing assets were million compared to million at december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was 
at december  compared to 
at december  this increase was caused by the residential and commercial portfolios 
commercial non performing loans are higher due to deterioration in a segment of the portfolio concentrated in cash flow based enterprise value lending  primarily in syndicated multi bank credits that were originated by other banks and participated in by sovereign 
residential loan delinquencies and non accruals increased due to the weakening economy 
sovereign places all commercial loans days or more delinquent except those in the process of collection on non performing status 
residential loans days delinquent except those well secured and in the process of collection are placed on non accrual status and a allowance allocation is assigned 
consumer loans days delinquent are placed on non accrual status and a allowance allocation is assigned 
in addition  sovereign calculates a specific reserve on all loans where it has been determined that a potential for loss exists 
consumer non accrual loans decreased from million at december  to million at december   as a result of a change in practice in recognizing consumer non performing loans from to days 
residential real estate owned increased from million at december  to million at december  reflecting an accelerated foreclosure process that occurred in certain parts of the acquired new england portfolio 
other repossessed assets increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily as a result of a methodology change in one of the serviced by others portfolios

allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non performing assets allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non performing loans loans that are past due days or more and still accruing interest increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase was due principally to the phase in of a methodology change in the treatment of delinquent loans during the first half of and a change in nonaccrual of certain consumer loans from to days past due to ensure consistency with all other consumer loans 
during  sovereign began to keep residential and consumer loans secured by real estate that are well secured loan to value of or less and in the process of collection on accrual status  in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
there were million of such loans at december  gross interest income for the years ended december   and would have increased by approximately million  million and million  respectively  had sovereign s period end non accruing and restructured loans been current in accordance with their original terms and outstanding throughout the period 
interest income recorded on these loans for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans consisting of loans for which management has doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present repayment terms  although not currently classified as non performing loans amounted to approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
delinquencies 
sovereign s loan delinquencies all performing loans or more days delinquent at december  were million  a decrease from million at december  as a percentage of total loans  performing delinquencies were management s discussion and analysis at december   a decrease from at december  residential performing loan delinquencies decreased from million to million during the same time periods  but increased as a percentage of total residential loans from to as a result of the decrease in the size of the overall residential portfolio 
consumer performing loan delinquencies increased from million to million  but decreased as a percentage of total consumer loans as a result of the increase in the size of the overall consumer portfolio 
commercial performing loan delinquencies decreased from million to million  and also decreased as a percentage of total commercial loans from to 
allowance for loan loss 
the adequacy of sovereign s allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb potential loan losses takes into consideration the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  past loan loss experience  specific loans which have loss potential  geographic and industry concentrations  delinquency trends  economic conditions  the level of originations and other relevant factors 
management also considers loan quality  changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  amount of non performing loans  delinquency trends  economic conditions and industry trends 
overall  management believes that delinquency  potential problem loan  non performing  and charge off statistics have evidenced deterioration related to economic conditions 
the allowance has been increased from to of total loans reflecting these trends and the shift in portfolio composition throughout the year  and credit risk management processes continue to identify deterioration as soon as possible 
sovereign maintains an allowance for loan losses which management believes is sufficient to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
sovereign believes the current allowance to be at a level adequate to cover such inherent losses 
at december   sovereign s total allowance was million 
sovereign s total allowance at year end equated to approximately times the average net charge offs for the prior three year period 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  sovereign also gives consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
sovereign applies similar methods of determining the loan loss allowance for purchased loan portfolios as it does in establishing allowances for originated loans 
sovereign established a million allowance for loan losses for the loans acquired in the new england acquisition 
in establishing this allowance  sovereign utilized its methodology  adjusted for increased uncertainty regarding the quality of the acquired loans 
sovereign performed specific reviews of large non homogeneous loans  and established specific allowances accordingly 
for homogenous loans  sovereign established the loan loss allowance based on limited available performance history  industry statistics and similar experiences with other acquired portfolios 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements i an allocated allowance  which for non homogeneous loans is comprised of allowances established on specific classified loans  and class allowances for both homogeneous and non homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and current trends  and ii unallocated allowances based on both general economic conditions and other risk factors in sovereign s individual markets and portfolios  and to account for a level of imprecision in management s estimation process 
the allowance recorded for consumer and residential portfolios is based on an analysis of product mix  credit scoring and risk composition of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences  economic conditions and historical and expected delinquency and charge off statistics for each homogeneous category or group of loans 
based on this information and analysis  an allowance is established in an amount sufficient to cover estimated net charge offs for a twelve month period 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on an analysis of the individual credits and relationships and is separated into two parts  the specific allowance and the class allowance 
the specific allowance element of the commercial loan allowance is based on a regular analysis of criticized commercial loans where internal credit ratings are below a predetermined classification 
this analysis is performed by the managed asset division  where loans with recognized deficiencies are administered  and periodically reviewed by credit risk management and the commercial asset review group 
the specific allowance established for these criticized loans is based on a careful analysis of related collateral value  cash flow considerations and  if applicable  guarantor capacity 
the class allowance element of the commercial loan allowance is determined by an internal loan grading process in conjunction with associated allowance factors 
these class allowance factors are updated annually and are based primarily on actual historical loss experience  consultation with regulatory authorities  and peer groups loss experience 
while this analysis is conducted annually  management has the ability to revise the class allowance factors whenever necessary in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given loan pool classification 
regardless of the extent of management analysis of customer performance  portfolio evaluations  trends or risk management processes established  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends  volatility of economic or customer conditions and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allocated allowances for homogeneous groups of loans among other factors 
sovereign maintains an unallocated allowance to recognize the existence of these exposures 
these other risk factors are continuously reviewed and revised by management where conditions indicate that the estimates initially applied are different from actual results 
a comprehensive analysis of the allowance for loan losses is performed by management on a quarterly basis 
in addition  a review of allowance levels based on nationally published statistics is conducted on an annual basis 
the chief credit officer  the chief risk management officer and the chairman of the asset review committee have the responsibility to affirm allowance methodology and to assess the general and specific allowance factors in relation to estimated and actual net charge off trends 
in addition  the group is also responsible for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for each loan pool classification at sovereign 
although management determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately and this process is an important credit management tool  the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio 
the actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
management s methodology includes several factors intended to minimize the differences between estimated and actual losses 
these factors allow management to adjust its estimate of losses based on the most recent information available 
management s discussion and analysis table summarizes sovereign s allocation of the allowance for loan losses for allocated and unallocated allowances by loan type  and the percentage of each loan type of total portfolio loans in thousands table allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december  of of of of of loans to loans to loans to loans to loans to total total total total total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans allocated allowances commmercial loans      residential real estate mortgage loans      consumer loans      unallocated allowances 
 n a  n a  n a  n a  n a total allowance for loan losses      residential portfolio 
the allowance for the residential mortgage portfolio decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was due primarily to the overall reduction in the residential portfolio by billion from billion at december  to billion at december  as a percentage of the total residential portfolio  the allowance decreased from 
to 
despite increases in delinquencies as a percent of loans outstanding and non performing loans in this portfolio  residential net charge offs have not experienced commensurate increases  and in fact decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of average loans  residential net charge offs decreased from 
in to 
in consumer portfolio 
the allowance for the consumer loan portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase was due to the overall growth in the portfolio which brought higher levels of substandard assets that carry higher reserve allowance percentages 
as a percentage of the entire consumer portfolio  the reserve increased from 
to 
during  net charge offs in this portfolio totaled million  as compared to million in the previous year  an increase of  however  the increase in charge offs as a percentage of outstandings increased only from 
to 
commercial portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses for the commercial portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december  as a percentage of the total commercial portfolio  the allowance increased from to 
this increase was due primarily to higher levels of special mention and substandard assets that carry higher reserve allowance percentages  especially in the cash flow portfolio 
during  net charge offs in this portfolio totaled million  as compared to million in  however  charge offs only increased from 
to 
of the respective average portfolio  due to the overall increase in the total commercial portfolio during unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance decreased from million at december  to million at december  as a percentage of the total reserve  the unallocated portion decreased from to 
this decrease reflects the bank s increased precision in its methodology of calculating the allocated portion of the allowance  combined with the increased familiarity and seasoning of the acquired loan portfolios 
bank regulatory capital federal law requires institutions regulated by the office of thrift supervision to have a minimum leverage capital ratio equal to of tangible assets and of risk adjusted assets  and a risk based capital ratio equal to 
federal law also requires ots regulated institutions to have a minimum tangible capital equal to of total tangible assets 
the ots order  requires sovereign bank to be well capitalized and also to meet certain other additional capital ratio requirements above the regulatory minimum  and other conditions 
sovereign s various agreements with its lenders also require it to cause sovereign bank to be well capitalized at all times and in compliance with all regulatory requirements 
to be well capitalized  an ots institution must maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and total risk based capital of at least 
as of december   sovereign bank was classified as well capitalized and in compliance with the conditions and capital requirements discussed above 
management expects that sovereign bank will continue to be classified as well capitalized and in compliance with such capital requirements and conditions 
although ots capital regulations do not apply to savings and loan holding companies  the ots order requires sovereign to maintain certain tier capital and related liquidity levels 
sovereign is presently in compliance with these requirements and expects to remain in compliance

liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents the ability of sovereign to obtain cost effective funding to meet the needs of customers  as well as sovereign s financial obligations 
sovereign s primary sources of liquidity include retail deposit gathering  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  federal funds purchases  reverse repurchase agreements and wholesale deposit purchases 
other sources of liquidity include asset securitizations  liquid investment portfolio securities and debt and equity issuances 
factors which impact the liquidity position of sovereign include loan origination volumes  loan prepayment rates  maturity structure of existing loans  core deposit growth levels  cd maturity structure and retention  sovereign s credit ratings  investment portfolio cash flows  maturity structure of wholesale funding  etc 
these risks are monitored and centrally managed 
this process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources 
as of december   sovereign had billion in available overnight liquidity in the form of unused federal funds purchased lines  unused fhlb borrowing capacity and unencumbered investment portfolio securities 
sovereign also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure that adequate liquidity is available at all times 
sovereign bank has several sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements  including the securities portfolio  the core deposit base  the ability to acquire large deposits and issue public securities in the local and national markets  fhlb borrowings  federal funds management s discussion and analysis purchased  reverse repurchase agreements  wholesale deposit purchases and the capability to securitize or package loans for sale
