item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general ameriana bancorp the company was incorporated under indiana law for the purpose of becoming the holding company for ameriana bank and trust of indiana 
in  the company acquired all of ameriana bank and trust of indiana common stock in connection with its reorganization into the holding company form of ownership 
in  the company acquired ameriana bank of ohio  fsb abo 
abo was merged into ameriana bank and trust of indiana in october on june   ameriana bank and trust of indiana converted from a federal savings bank to an indiana chartered state savings bank and changed its name to ameriana bank and trust  sb abt 
the conversion is not expected to have a material effect on the company s business but is expected to reduce the assessments paid for examinations and supervision of abt 
at the same time  the company contributed ameriana insurance agency  inc aia to abt 
aia operates a general insurance agency in three locations 
abt has a brokerage operation through its wholly owned subsidiary ameriana financial services  inc  which also owns a partial interest in a life insurance company 
in  the company purchased a minority interest in a limited partnership organized to acquire and manage real estate investments  which qualify for federal tax credits 
the largest components of the company s total revenue and total expense are interest income and interest expense  respectively 
consequently  the company s earnings are primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is determined by i the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread  and ii the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
levels of other income and operating expenses also significantly affect net income 
the company s investment securities increased  and during and were changed to the classification of available for sale at december   from the classification of held to maturity at december  the company determined that because of its interest rate risk it would not be able to continue to hold its investment securities to maturity and recorded an accumulated other comprehensive loss of  as of december  federal agencies decreased  and reflecting calls totaling  and net purchases  amortization of discounts and accretions of premiums totaling  and a net increase for presenting the security at fair value of  the ending carrying value of federal agencies was  and has an average yield of at year end the investment securities also include trust preferred stock investments purchased during for  including a  gain for the fair value adjustment and had an average yield of 
mortgage backed securities mbs and collateralized mortgage obligations cmo increased  and during composed of net purchases  amortization of discounts and accretions of premiums totaling  reduced by  of principal collections and a net decrease of  for presenting the securities at fair value 
these purchases were used to offset the decrease in loans and calls of federal agencies 
the mbs cmo ending balance at fair value is  and the portfolio has an average return of at year end the company has determined to dispose of its cmo portfolio during the first quarter of at an estimated loss of million 
proceeds from the disposition will be used to pay down federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
the company s portfolio of loans before deducting undisbursed loan proceeds and deferred loan fees has decreased  and in over residential mortgage loans decreased  and  commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans increased  and  installment loans decreased  and and loans secured by deposits decreased  and 
residential mortgages decreased as customers refinanced loans in portfolio for fixed rate loans which were then sold in the secondary market 
as rates decreased during  the demand for fixed rate mortgages increased to the point that the majority of residential mortgages  other than jumbo loans  were made at fixed rates 
the substantial percentage increase in commercial loans was due to increased purchases of commercial participation loans and leases along with increases in direct commercial real estate loans 
the mix of fixed rate to adjustable rate and short term balloon loans was to at year end  compared to to at year end and year end being to 
the increase in fixed rate loans was caused by the preference of borrowers to request fixed rate loans in the lower interest rate environment during as compared to the year when the customer s preference was for variable rate loans during the higher rate environment 
the increase in the fixed rate loan demand and sales to the secondary market resulted in the gain on sales of loans increasing to  in from  in and  in total loan volume was  in   in and  in the company sold  of fixed rate residential mortgage loans in compared to  in and  in total deposits increased  and to  at december   from  at december  all types of deposits  except for savings  increased 
demand deposits increased  and to  at december  from  at december   with the increase being in both now and money market rate accounts 
total certificates of deposit increased  and to  at december  from  at december   and were due to increases of  in regular certificates and increases of  in negotiated rate certificates primarily from local county governmental entities 
savings deposits decreased  and to  at december   from  at december   due mostly to movement to higher interest bearing demand deposit rate products 
on december   abt sold  of demand and savings deposits with the loveland branch in ohio  and a gain of  was recorded on the sale 
the balance sheet decreased  and at december   compared to december  the increase in total deposits and the funds from the decrease in the balance sheet were used to reduce the fhlb advances  which decreased  and to  at december   from  at december  the company has a note payable of  at as of december   and it had a balance of  at at december  these proceeds were used to repurchase the company s stock in the company also has notes payable with balances of  and  at december  and  respectively  which are and relate to the cardinal state bank purchase 
the company continues to experience competitive forces on its deposits from other institutions in the marketplace  but the company was able to compete with these investing alternatives by providing additional investment choices for its customers through its brokerage and insurance products 
the company has continued to increase the level of non interest sensitive fee income producing assets 
these activities include an equity interest in a life insurance company and ownership of a full service general line property and casualty insurance agency and brokerage services 
in january  the bank invested in a limited liability company  with two other financial institutions that will operate a title insurance company 
as noted above  loans sold increased in over after decreasing during over and servicing of sold loans as of december  increased to  from  and  at december  and  respectively 
abo sold  of loan servicing for a gain of  in may no sales or purchases of loan servicing were done in or interest sensitivity the following table presents the company s interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets at fair value and interest bearing liabilities at december  this table assumes no prepayments of loans or mbs cmo  no early redemption of securities at call dates  no early withdrawals of certificates of deposit and no extension of deposit account sensitivity relating to core deposit stability

interest rate risk abt is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and borrowings from the fhlb  mature or reprice at different rates than its interest earning assets 
although having liabilities that mature or reprice less frequently on average than assets will be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure will result in lower net income during periods of declining interest rates  unless offset by other factors 
the asset liability committee and the board of directors review abt s exposure to interest rate changes and market risk on a quarterly basis 
this review is accomplished by the use of a cash flow simulation model using detailed securities  loan and deposit  and market information to estimate the potential impact of interest rate increases and decreases on the earning assets and liabilities 
the model tests the impact on the net interest income under various interest rate scenarios by estimating the interest rate sensitivity position at each interest rate interval 
the change in the net portfolio value npv is also calculated at each interest rate interval 
this tests the interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
the model uses a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments or extension in maturity and repayment in mortgage loans  mbs cmo and certain types of callable investments 
these computations did not contemplate actions management undertook to reposition the assets and liabilities as discussed below  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the model of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below present levels  the portion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to loan refinancing or payoff activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  pre payment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the model and the ability of borrowers to repay their adjustable rate loans may decrease during rising interest rate environments 
the abt information below provides an assessment of the risk of npv in the event of sudden and sustained basis point increases and decreases in the prevailing interest rates as of december  npv as percent of net portfolio value present value of assets change dollar dollar percent in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp base or  bp   bp basis points as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
upon review of the above information and certain other interest rate risk reports for the period ending december   management determined that a significant deterioration had occurred in company s portfolio holdings of cmo resulting in a large increase in the company s exposure to future increases in interest rate risk 
upon further review  management determined that the increase in the exposure was significant enough to call into question the prudence of continuing to hold the securities to maturity 
in order to take the necessary action to reduce this exposure  management decided to move the entire securities portfolio from the held to maturity accounting classification to the available for sale classification as of december  the company has determined that most of its investments no longer fit its risk profile given the unsettled  uncertain and volatile nature of the market and the possibility that interest rates could move against the portfolio 
the decelerating speed of prepayments on these instruments during the first quarter of has been remarkable  significantly extending the practical maturity of the portfolio to a level that is now unacceptable 
the alternatives to taking immediate action to mitigate the potential losses  including long term funding strategies  hedging strategies and partial liquidations  were felt to be inadequate in the circumstances 
the company decided to liquidate the majority of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of the proceeds from the liquidation of the company s investments will be used first to repay short term borrowings from the fhlb 
this will increase the company s flexibility to retain more of its self originated loans in portfolio and to purchase loan participations in the region  as they become available 
the balance of the proceeds will be used to purchase short term liquid investments  including limited maturity mbs  which present little in the way of interest rate risk compared with the liquidated investments 
the company also will use some proceeds to invest in intermediate term mbs to provide a balance to its portfolio between interest rate risk reduction and maintenance of higher net interest income levels

net income for the year ended december   had increased  and  from  basic and diluted earnings per share in the year due to an increase in other income and lower tax expense both of which were attributable in large part to an increase in the cash surrender value of the company owned life insurance policies 
net interest income net interest income increased by  in compared to and was due to a greater decrease in interest costs   and compared to a decrease in interest income of  and 
the average interest earning assets decreased only to  in from  in and the interest bearing liabilities increased only to  in from  in the total interest rate on average earning assets decreased basis points to in from in the decrease in interest expense was due to increased volume and a small increase in costs of deposits while correspondingly reducing fhlb advances and notes payable 
the total interest rate on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in from in the decrease in interest income was due to the increase in loans and mbs cmo at lower interest rates offset by calls on agency investment securities 
the company s net interest spread increased basis points to in from in net interest income was essentially even between and  declining by  although interest income increased by  and  interest expense increased by a greater amount   and 
the increase in interest income and interest expense were driven primarily by growth in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  respectively  as the company has sought to better leverage its balance sheet 
also contributing to the greater increase in interest expense was the higher average cost of interest bearing liabilities  which jumped basis points while the average yield on interest earning assets increased by only basis points 
as a result of the greater increase in average costs  the company s net interest spread narrowed basis points to in from for the company s average portfolio balance of loans increased to  for the year  from  for the year this average loan portfolio had increased for the year over the  average for the year the ending balance of loans was   and  for  and  respectively 
loan originations and purchases were up to  in compared to  in sold loans  which are all fixed rate residential mortgage loans  were up to  compared to  in and were down in compared to  in the loan portfolio decreased in because the volume of residential mortgage loans were mostly fixed rate loans  which are sold to the secondary market 
the commercial loans  both mortgage and other commercial loans  did increase  and in this is due to both purchases of loan participations  lease purchases and an increase in the volume of direct commercial loans 
the installment loans decreased  and due to reduced loan volume as market competitive rates were below minimums established by the company 
the loan portfolio had grown in because more of the loans were commercial and variable rate residential mortgage loans  which were retained as compared to purchased loans were  in   in and  in the company s average portfolio balance of mbs cmo increased in to  and had decreased to  for the year from  for the year the ending balance of mbs cmo was   and  for  and  respectively

the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was at december   at december  and at december   and represents management s best estimate of expected charge offs in the loan portfolio 
net loan charge offs have historically been less than the annual provision for loan losses and were   and  for the years  and  respectively 
non performing assets eg  real estate owned  non accrual loans and loans days or more past due were   and  at december   and  respectively 
the non performing assets include  of real estate repossessed by the company and carried on the books at their book value or fair market value less estimated selling costs  whichever is lower 
comparable repossessed real estate was  at december   and zero at december  the non performing assets also include  for a loan on an apartment complex that has an appraisal for of its carrying value 
the provision includes  for a non performing loan that was acquired in the cardinal state bank purchase 
this loan was written off during the first quarter of if this loan is deleted from the net charge offs  the provision of  exceeds the  of charged offs by  the company believes it has established an adequate allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the variation in the amount of provision charged against income is directly related to changes in loan charge offs  non performing loans  loan delinquencies  economic conditions in the company s lending area and loan growth or reduction during each year 
other income other income was   and  for  and  respectively 
the gains on sales of loans and servicing rights of  were significantly higher than  in and  in in a gain of  from the sale of servicing rights was included and no servicing rights were sold in or these changes reflect the change in demand for fixed rate real estate loans 
in  rates were decreasing all year and the consumer wanted a fixed rate residential mortgage loan which is sold in the secondary market  but in and the average mortgage rates were higher and the consumer preferred a variable rate residential mortgage loan which is normally retained in portfolio 
the net loan servicing fees of   and  for the years  and  respectively  have increased and reflect the retention and increase of average loans serviced 
operating losses associated with the limited partnership amounted to  in   in and  in at the same time as these losses are reflected the company also reflected federal income tax credits of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
brokerage and insurance commissions have decreased slightly each of the last three years with  in   in and  in the recession had a direct influence on this income during and the latter part of abt invested in life insurance on employees and directors  with a balance or cash surrender value of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the majority of the policies were purchased during  and accordingly the nontaxable increase in cash surrender value of life insurance was  in   in and  in the income included a one time adjustment of  related to the value of insurance policies on two retired employees 
other expense operating expenses were   and  for  and  respectively 
these yearly increases were due to normal increases and to additional expense of operating a new trust department  commercial loan department and a new branch that abt opened during december the expenses also included additional costs related to the year compliance 
the conversion of both banks to the same mainframe system had provided for a reduction of data processing expense during this reduction was offset in by improvements made in data processing and the initial expense of implementing check imaging 
data processing expense and other expenses in include some additional costs related to the merger of the two banks during that year 
the merger of the banks is expected to reduce expenses in future years 
income tax expense income tax expense was  in   in and  in the effective tax rate was in  in and in the increase in was due to lower non taxable insurance income and to higher state taxes and higher pretax income 
the decrease in tax expense in from is due to slightly lower pretax income and to a lower effective tax rate due to the nontaxable insurance income and to lower state income taxes due to change in state law 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail of income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources historically  funds provided by operations  loan principal repayments and new deposits have been the company s principal sources of liquid funds 
in addition  the company has the ability to obtain funds through the sale of new mortgage loans and through borrowings from the fhlb system 
at december   the company s commitments for loans in process totaled  management believes that the company s liquidity and other sources of funds will be sufficient to fund all outstanding commitments and other cash needs 
a portion of these commitments is for fixed rate mortgage loans  which will be sold immediately into the secondary market 
an amendment of the stock option plan  which provides for the granting of incentive and non qualified stock options  was approved by the shareholders in april and extended the plan s term to ten years and increased the number of shares reserved under the plan from  to  shares 
no options for exercise of shares were done in options for shares in and  shares in were exercised 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for option activity and the pro forma effect on net income 
in april  the company s board of directors approved an additional one year and  for a stock repurchase program 
the stock repurchase program  which began in july  was a one year repurchase program of  to acquire up to of the company s outstanding common stock 
the company repurchased  shares in and  shares in at an aggregate cost of  and  respectively 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same rate as changes in the prices of goods and services  which are directly affected by inflation  although interest rates may fluctuate in response to perceived changes in the rate of inflation 
current accounting issues in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
 business combinations requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating the use of the pooling of interests method 
it also provides new criteria that determine whether an acquisition involving acquired intangible assets should be recognized separately from goodwill 
this statement does not presently affect the company but would be followed in any future acquisitions 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires that upon adoption  any goodwill recorded on an entity s balance sheet would no longer be amortized 
this would include existing goodwill recorded at the date of adoption and any future goodwill 
goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least once a year and adjusted by reduction of the carrying value of goodwill if the asset is impaired 
at december   the company had  of goodwill on its balance sheet that was amortized at a rate of  in this goodwill is composed of  that will no longer be amortized but will be tested for impairment of carrying value on an annual basis 
the  balance classified as core deposit intangibles  at the time of the cardinal state bank acquisition  will continue to be amortized over years at a rate of  in item a
