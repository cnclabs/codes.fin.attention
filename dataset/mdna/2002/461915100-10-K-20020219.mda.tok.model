item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we provide a broad range of services to a variety of financial asset managers 
these services include our core services  global custody  multicurrency accounting and mutual fund administration  as well as our value added services  such as securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency and investment advisory services 
at december   we provided services for approximately billion in net assets  including approximately billion of foreign net assets 
on october   we acquired the domestic institutional trust and custody business of bankboston  na under the terms of the purchase agreement  we paid approximately million to bankboston as of the closing and subsequently paid an additional million based upon client retention 
the acquired business provides master trust and custody services to endowments  pension funds  municipalities  mutual funds and other financial institutions 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the acquisition  we also entered into an outsourcing agreement with bankboston under which we provided custodial services for bankboston s private banking and institutional asset management businesses 
in  the outsourcing agreement and a custody agreement with the bankboston sponsored funds were terminated 
as a result of the early termination of the outsourcing agreement and the funds custody agreement  we received a total of million in termination fees 
we have not experienced a material impact on net income due to the termination of either agreement 
we were informed by bankboston that its decision to terminate both of the agreements was not related in any way to our quality of service  but was made as part of the integration process undertaken in connection with the merger of bankboston with fleet 
on february   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable on march  all numbers in this report have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split paid march   where applicable 
on march   we completed the issuance and sale of  shares of common stock at per share in a private placement to one investor 
the net capital raised in the private placement was used to support our balance sheet growth 
on march   we acquired the right to provide institutional custody and related services for accounts managed by the trust company of the west  formerly serviced by sanwa bank california 
the accounts subject to the agreement totaled approximately billion in assets 
on may   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable on june  all numbers in this report have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split paid june   where applicable 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and the corresponding amendments and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
on adoption of these new accounting standards  we recorded a transition adjustment recognizing an after tax reduction in other comprehensive income oci of million 
in conjunction with the adoption  we elected to reclassify approximately million of securities from held to maturity to available for sale  which further reduced oci  net of tax  by approximately million 
on february   we completed the issuance and sale of  shares of common stock at per share in a public offering 
a portion of the proceeds was used to fund the acquisition of the advisor custody unit of the chase manhattan bank 
the remaining proceeds were used for the assumption of the us asset administration unit of barclays global investors  na and working capital 
on february   we purchased the advisor custody unit of the chase manhattan bank 
this unit provided institutional custody services to individual accounts holding approximately billion in assets as of february  these accounts consist of individual accounts  trusts  endowments and corporate accounts whose assets are managed by third party investment advisors 
pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we paid to chase at the closing of the transaction approximately million of the total purchase price  plus another million in exchange for the book value of loans to clients 
in  we are obligated to pay another million contingent upon client retention 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
on may   we assumed the operations of the us asset administration unit of barclays global investors  na bgi  a large international institutional investment manager 
the unit  located in sacramento  california  provides custody  fund accounting and other operations functions for bgi s clients 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
the events of september  did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
revenue and expense overview we derive our revenue from financial asset servicing 
although interest income and non interest income are reported separately for financial statement presentation purposes  our clients view the pricing of our service offerings on a bundled basis 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  management analyzes all expected revenue and related expenses  as opposed to separately analyzing fee income and interest income and related expenses for each from the relationship 
accordingly  we believe net operating revenue net interest income plus non interest income and net income are the most meaningful measures of our financial results 
net operating revenue increased to million in from million in net income increased to million from million in non interest income consists primarily of fees for financial asset servicing and is principally derived from global custody  multicurrency accounting  mutual fund administration and institutional transfer agency services for financial asset managers and the assets they control 
our clients pay fees based on the volume of assets under custody  portfolio transactions  income collected and whether other value added services such as foreign exchange  securities lending and performance measurement are needed 
asset based fees are usually charged on a sliding scale and are subject to minimum fees 
as such  when the assets in a portfolio under custody grow as a result of changes in market values or cash inflows  our fees may be a smaller percentage of those assets 
if the value of equity assets held by our clients were to increase or decrease by  we estimate that this  by itself  would currently cause a corresponding change of approximately in our earnings per share 
if the value of fixed income assets held by our clients were to increase or decrease by  we estimate that this  by itself  would currently cause a corresponding change of approximately in our earnings per share 
net interest income represents the difference between income generated from interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest bearing liabilities are generated by our clients who  in the course of their financial asset management  generate cash balances which they deposit on a short term basis with us 
we invest these cash balances and remit a portion of the earnings on these investments to our clients 
our share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total package of compensation paid to us from our clients for performing asset servicing 
operating expenses consist of costs incurred in support of our business activities 
as a service provider  our largest expenditures are staffing costs  including compensation and benefits 
we also rely heavily on technological tools and services for processing  communicating and storing data 
as a result  our technology and telecommunication expense is also a large percentage of our operating expenses 
significant accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following accounting policies that  as a result of the complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in significant changes to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
derivative financial instruments we do not purchase derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate swap agreements are matched with specific financial instruments reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rate risks 
we routinely enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate 
these transactions are designed to hedge a portion of our liabilities in connection with securities sold under repurchase agreements 
by entering into a pay fixed receive floating interest rate swap  a portion of these liabilities is effectively converted to a fixed rate liability for the term of the interest rate swap agreement 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
we also adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative and the item being hedged will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in oci 
ineffective portions of changes  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives that do not qualify as hedges  changes in their fair value are recognized in earnings 
hedge accounting requires that we measure the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges as compared to changes in expected cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions for each reporting period 
this process involves the estimation of the expected future cash flows of hedged transactions 
changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could affect the timing of the recognition of changes in fair value of certain hedging derivatives 
the measurement of fair value is based upon market values  however  in the absence of quoted market values  measurement involves valuation estimates 
these estimates are based on methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances 
however  the use of alternative assumptions could have a significant effect on estimated fair value 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 had an insignificant impact on earnings for the twelve months ended december  no cash flow hedges were dedesignated or discontinued for the twelve months ended december  we enter into foreign exchange contracts with clients and strive to enter into a matched position with another bank 
these contracts are subject to market value fluctuations in foreign currencies 
gains and losses from such fluctuations are netted and recorded as an adjustment of asset servicing fees 
unrealized gains losses resulting from purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts are included within the respective other assets and other liabilities categories on our consolidated balance sheet 
the foreign exchange contracts have been reduced by balances with the same counterparty where a master netting agreement exists 
new accounting principles in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisiton contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for by a single method the purchase method 
this statement requires that intangible assets that can be identified and named be recognized as assets apart from goodwill under certain criteria 
this statement also requires disclosure of the primary reasons for a business combination and the allocation of the purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption 
when the amounts of goodwill and intangible assets acquired are significant in relation to the purchase price paid  additional disclosures about those assets are required 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  we do not anticipate a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes apb no 
 intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
this statement affects the accounting of premiums  includes guidelines for the determination  measurement and testing of impairment  and requires disclosure of information about goodwill and other intangible assets in the years subsequent to their acquisition that was not previously required 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  this statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill  and requires that goodwill be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
this statement affects all goodwill recognized on our consolidated balance sheet  regardless of when the goodwill was initially recorded 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the sec including this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  and which involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are identified by words such as may  will  could  should  expect  plan  intend  seek  anticipate  believe  estimate  potential  or continue or other comparable terms or the negative of those terms 
forward looking statements in this form k include certain statements regarding liquidity  the timing and effect on earnings of derivative gains and losses  the effect on earnings of declines in equity values  and the effect of certain legal claims against us 
our actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in our filings with the sec 
the failure to properly manage our growth could adversely affect the quality of our services and result in the loss of clients 
we have been experiencing a period of rapid growth that has required the dedication of significant management and other resources  including the recent assumption of the us asset administration unit of bgi 
continued rapid growth could place a strain on our management and other resources 
to manage future growth effectively  we must continue to invest in our operational  financial and other internal systems  and our human resources 
also  we must continue to expand our office space at reasonable rates in a competitive real estate market 
our future results depend  in part  on successful integration of pending and possible future acquisitions and outsourcing transactions 
the integration of the bgi asset administration unit presents us with challenges and demands management attention that has to be diverted from other matters 
integration of acquisitions and outsourcing transactions is complicated and frequently presents unforeseen difficulties and expenses which can affect whether and when a particular acquisition will be accretive to our earnings per share 
any future acquisitions will present similar challenges 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel in order to succeed 
qualified personnel  in particular managers and other senior personnel  are in great demand throughout the financial services industry 
we could find it increasingly difficult to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the securities markets 
we base some of our fees on the market value of the assets we process 
accordingly  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates or the securities markets as these fluctuations affect the market value of assets processed 
fluctuations in interest rates or the securities markets can also lead to investors seeking alternatives to the investment offerings of our clients  which could result in a lesser amount of assets processed and correspondingly lower fees 
also  our net interest income is earned by investing depositors funds and making loans 
rapid changes in interest rates or changes in the relationship between different index rates could adversely affect the market value of  or the earnings produced by  our investment and loan portfolios 
we face significant competition from other financial services companies  which could negatively affect our operating results 
we are part of an extremely competitive asset servicing industry 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
these greater resources could  for example  allow our competitors to develop technology superior to our own 
in addition  we face the risk that large mutual fund complexes may build in house asset servicing capabilities and no longer outsource these services to us 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
a material portion of our revenues is derived from our relationship with barclays global investors  na as a result of our assumption of the us asset administration unit of bgi in and our ongoing relationship with bgi s ishares and master investment portfolios  bgi accounted for approximately of our net operating revenue during the year ended december  we expect that bgi will continue to account for a significant portion of our net operating revenue 
while we provide services to bgi under long term contracts  those contracts may be terminated for certain regulatory and fiduciary reasons 
the loss of bgi s business could cause our net operating revenue to decline and could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual results 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology 
our proprietary technology is important to our business 
we rely on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary technology  all of which offer only limited protection 
these intellectual property rights may be invalidated or our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may be unsuccessful  and could also be expensive and divert management s attention 
we may incur significant costs defending infringement claims 
we have been sued in federal court claiming that we and others are infringing a patent allegedly covering the creation and trading of certain securities  including exchange traded funds 
while we believe the claim is without merit  we cannot be sure that we will prevail in the defense of this claim 
any patent litigation would be costly and could divert the attention of management 
if we were found to infringe the patent  we would have to pay damages and would be ordered to cease any infringing activity or seek a license under the patent 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain a license on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  if at all 
while we are indemnified against some defense costs and damages related to this claim  we may incur significant expenses defending the claim 
as a result  any determination of infringement could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may become subject to other infringement claims in the future 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and annually for several reasons  including the timing of commencement or termination of client engagements  and the rate of net inflows and outflows of investor funds in the investment vehicles offered by our clients 
most of our expenses  like employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
as a result  any shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could significantly affect our operating results 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulations that impose complex restraints on our business 
federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies apply to us 
our primary banking regulators are the federal reserve board frb  the federal deposit insurance commission fdic and the massachusetts commissioner of banks 
virtually all aspects of our operations are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight including the following the frb and the fdic maintain capital requirements that we must meet 
failure to meet those requirements could lead to severe regulatory action or even receivership 
we are currently considered to be well capitalized  under massachusetts law  the bank may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends to investors financial  which may in turn restrict our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  and the frb and the fdic are empowered to assess monetary penalties against  and to order termination of activities by  companies or individuals who violate the law 
banking law restricts our ability to own the stock of certain companies and also makes it more difficult for our company to be acquired 
also  we have not elected financial holding company status under the federal gramm leach bliley act of this may place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to other organizations 
statement of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and non interest income non interest income was million in  up from non interest income consists of the following items dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change asset servicing fees   other operating income   total non interest income   asset servicing fees were million in  up from the largest component of asset servicing fees is asset based fees  which increased due to the increase in assets processed 
assets processed is the total dollar value of financial assets on the reported date for which we provide one or more of the following services global custody  multicurrency accounting  mutual fund administration  securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency  investment advisory services and lines of credit 
net assets processed increased billion to billion at december  from this net increase includes several components dollars in billions bgi processing agreement chase advisor custody unit further penetration of existing clients sales to new clients lost clients fund flows and market gain loss net increase in assets processed another significant portion of the increase in asset servicing fees resulted from the success in marketing ancillary services  such as foreign exchange and securities lending services 
other operating income consists of dividends received relating to the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb stock investment and miscellaneous fees for systems consulting services 
the increase in other operating income resulted from an increase in fhlbb stock dividend income due to an increase in the average investment in fhlbb stock during the year ended december  and increased income from consulting services performed for clients 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million in  up from the components of operating expenses were as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change compensation and benefits   technology and telecommunications   transaction processing services   occupancy   depreciation and amortization   travel and sales promotion   professional fees   amortization of goodwill   other operating expenses   total operating expenses   compensation and benefits expense was million in  up from due to several factors 
the average number of employees increased to  during the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  we increased the number of employees to support the expansion of client relationships and to service new business acquisitions 
approximately and employees were added as part of the chase acquisition and the bgi business unit assumption  respectively 
in addition  compensation expense related to our management incentive plans increased million between years  consistent with higher earnings and additional incentive eligible managers 
benefits  including payroll taxes  group insurance plans  retirement plan contributions and tuition reimbursement  increased million for the year ended december  this increase was due principally to increased payroll taxes attributable to the increase in headcount 
technology and telecommunications expense was million in  up from transitional services incurred as a result of the chase acquisition agreement accounted for approximately million of the increase 
increased hardware  software and telecommunications expenditures needed to support the growth in assets processed accounted for million of the increase 
expenses related to outsourced network monitoring and help desk service  which commenced in  along with mainframe data processing  disaster recovery and other outsourced services accounted for million of the increase 
transaction processing services expense was million in  up from the increase relates primarily to increased subcustodian fees  driven by growth in assets processed for clients 
occupancy expense was million in  up from this increase was primarily due to increased rent resulting from the california offices assumed from bgi and the expansion of our office space in boston  new york and dublin at current market rental rates 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  up from this increase resulted from capitalized expenditures associated with the expansion into additional office space and capitalized software 
travel and sales promotion expense was million  up from the increase was due to the increased level of business activity and the addition of a california office this year 
travel and sales promotion expense consists of expenses incurred by the sales force  client management staff and other employees in connection with sales calls to potential clients  traveling to existing client sites  and to our new york and california offices and our foreign subsidiaries 
professional fees were million in  up from primarily due to system conversion costs for the advisor custody unit acquired from chase and for legal and other consulting services 
amortization of goodwill expense was million  up from the increase was the result of the increase in goodwill from acquisition activities this year 
please refer to the overview section for a further discussion of acquisitions 
other operating expenses were million in  up from other operating expenses include fees for recruiting  office supplies  temporary help and various regulatory fee assessments 
recruiting expenses and temporary help accounted for approximately million of the increase while the growth in assets processed and the set up of new offices in contributed to the overall increase in other operating expenses 
net interest income net interest income is affected by the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  and the movement and level of interest rates 
the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category dollars in thousands for the year ended december  vs december  change due to volume change due to rate net interest earning assets fed funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements  investment securities    loans total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities deposits    borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities    change in net interest income    net interest income was million in  up from this net increase resulted from an increase in interest income of million net of an increase in interest expense of million 
the improvement in net interest income reflects the positive effect of balance sheet growth driven by increased client deposits and borrowings and a more favorable interest rate environment 
the net interest margin increased to in  up basis points from average interest earning assets  primarily investment securities  were billion in  up from funding for the asset growth was provided by an increase in average borrowings  primarily client repurchase agreements and fhlbb advances  of billion and an increase in average client deposits of million 
the effect of changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was an increase in net interest income of approximately million in average yield on interest earning assets was in  down basis points from the average rate that we paid on interest bearing liabilities was in  down basis points from the decrease in rates reflects the lower interest rate environment in compared with the effect on net interest income due to changes in rates was an increase of approximately million during the fiscal year ended december  on january   we adopted sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative and the item being hedged will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in oci 
ineffective portions of changes  as determined in accordance with sfas  in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives that do not qualify as hedges  changes in their fair value are recognized in earnings 
the adoption of sfas on january   resulted in no cumulative effect type adjustment to net income 
however  we recorded a reduction to oci of million  net of tax  and a corresponding liability for the fair value of the interest rate swaps 
the reduction to oci and the recognition of the liability are primarily attributable to net unrealized losses on cash flow hedges as of initial adoption 
in conjunction with the adoption  we elected to reclassify approximately million of securities from held to maturity to available for sale  which further reduced oci  net of tax  by approximately million 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rate risks 
we routinely enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate 
these transactions are designed to hedge a portion of our liabilities in connection with securities sold under repurchase agreements 
by entering into a pay fixed receive floating interest rate swap  a portion of these liabilities is effectively converted to a fixed rate liability for the term of the interest rate swap agreement 
most of these derivatives have been designated as highly effective cash flow hedges  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
an insignificant portion of the derivatives used to manage exposures to interest rate risks were not considered highly effective and  therefore  did not qualify for hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 had an insignificant impact on earnings for the twelve months ended december  no cash flow hedges were dedesignated or discontinued for the twelve months ended december  net interest income included net losses of million  net of tax  for the twelve months ended december  on interest rate swaps relating to sfas no 
the net loss consisted of a million gain  net of tax  for the twelve month period on changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments 
there were also million of derivative losses  net of tax  for the twelve month period that resulted primarily from the reclassification of transition adjustment related derivative losses from oci to net interest income in accordance with sfas no 
we estimate that million  net of tax  of the remaining transition adjustment of net derivative losses included in oci will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months 
the recognition in net interest income of the transition adjustment derivative losses from oci will be offset by derivative gains from changes in the fair value liability of the interest rate swaps as they reach maturity 
income taxes income taxes were million in  up from  consistent with the increased level of pre tax income 
the overall effective tax rate was for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects our increased investment in nontaxable municipal securities in comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and non interest income non interest income was million in  up from non interest income consists of the following items dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change asset servicing fees   other operating income   total non interest income   asset servicing fees were million in  up from the largest component of asset servicing fees is asset based fees  which increased due to the increase in assets processed

in addition  we use the investment portfolio to secure open positions at securities clearing institutions in connection with our custody services 
the portfolio is comprised of securities of state and political subdivisions  mortgage backed securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or freddie mac  and federal agency callable bonds issued by fhlmc and the fhlbb  municipal securities  securities issued by the small business administration sba  corporate debt securities  and a foreign government bond issued by the canadian province of manitoba 
we invest in mortgage backed securities  federal agency callable bonds and corporate debt to increase the total return of the investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty is unable to meet the terms of the contract 
prepayment risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates may cause mortgage securities to be paid off prior to their maturity dates 
federal agency callable bonds generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and call risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that the federal agency issuing the bonds may be unable to meet the terms of the bond 
call risk results from the possibility that fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in the exercise of the call option by the federal agency 
credit risk related to mortgage backed securities and federal agency callable bonds is substantially reduced by payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
we invest in municipal securities to generate stable  tax advantaged income 
municipal securities generally have lower stated yields than federal agency and us treasury securities  but the after tax yields are comparable 
municipal securities are subject to credit risk 
we invest in foreign government bonds in order to generate foreign source income to maximize the use of the foreign tax credit 
the foreign government bonds are denominated in us dollars to avoid foreign currency risk 
these bonds are subject to credit risk 
the book value and weighted average yield of our securities held to maturity at december  are reflected in the following table dollars in thousands years under to to over amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield mortgage backed securities   federal agency securities    state and political subdivisions   foreign government securities  total securities held to maturity   the carrying value and weighted average yield of our securities available for sale at december  are reflected in the following table dollars in thousands years under to to over amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield mortgage backed securities   federal agency securities  corporate debt  state and political subdivisions   total securities available for sale   loan portfolio the following table summarizes our loan portfolio for the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  loans to individuals      loans to mutual funds      loans to others less allowance for loan losses net loans      floating rate      fixed rate we make loans to individually managed account customers and to mutual funds and other pooled product clients 
virtually all loans to individually managed account customers are written on a demand basis  bear variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or the federal funds rate and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradable securities held in custody by us for the borrower 
loans to mutual funds and other pooled product clients include unsecured lines of credit that may  in the event of default  be collateralized at our option by securities held in custody by us for those mutual funds 
loans to individually managed account customers  mutual funds and other pooled product clients also include advances that we make to certain clients pursuant to the terms of our custody agreements with those clients to facilitate securities transactions and redemptions 
at december   our only lending concentrations that exceeded of total loan balances were the lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
our credit loss experience has been excellent 
there have been no loan charge offs or adverse credit actions in our history 
it is our policy to place a loan on non accrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no loans on non accrual status  no loans greater than days past due  and no troubled debt restructurings 
although virtually all of our loans are fully collateralized with freely tradable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has recorded an allowance for loan losses of million at december  this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
market risk we engage in investment activities to serve clients investment needs and contribute to overall corporate earnings 
interest bearing liabilities are generated by our clients who  in the course of their financial asset management  maintain cash balances which they deposit on a short term basis with us 
we invest these cash balances and remit a portion of the earnings on these investments to our clients 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in market prices and interest rates 
the level of risk we assume is a function of our overall strategic objectives and liquidity needs  client requirements and market volatility 
the active management of market risk is integral to our operations 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest revenue under various economic conditions 
we manage the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by adjusting their mix  yield  maturity and or repricing characteristics  based on market conditions 
since client deposits and repurchase agreements  our primary sources of funds  are predominantly short term  we maintain a generally short term structure for our interest earning assets  including money market assets and investments 
we also use term borrowings and interest rate swap agreements to augment our management of interest rate exposure 
the effect of the swap agreements is to lengthen short term variable rate liabilities into longer term fixed rate liabilities 
our board of directors has set asset and liability management policies that define the overall framework for managing interest rate sensitivity  including accountabilities and controls over investment activities 
these policies delineate investment limits and strategies that are appropriate  given our liquidity and regulatory requirements 
for example  we have established a policy limit stating that projected net interest income over the next months will not be reduced by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points or over months 
each quarter  our board of directors reviews our investment position  including simulations of the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our capital 
our board of directors has delegated day to day responsibility for oversight of the asset and liability management function to our asset and liability committee alco 
alco is a senior management committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the president  the chief financial officer and members of the treasury function 
alco meets twice monthly 
our primary tool in managing interest rate sensitivity is an income simulation model 
key assumptions in the simulation model include the timing of cash flows  maturities and repricing of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  capital planning and deposit sensitivity 
the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period will change periodically over the period being measured 
the model also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result  the model cannot precisely predict the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the results of the income simulation model as of december  and indicated that an upward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and  respectively 
a downward shift of basis points would result in a decrease in projected net interest income of at december  and an increase in projected net interest income of at december  we also use gap analysis as a secondary tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity 
gap analysis involves measurement of the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time frame 
a positive gap indicates that more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
by seeking to minimize the amount of assets and liabilities that could reprice in the same time frame  we attempt to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
as shown in the table below  at december   interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than interest earning assets  as has been typical for us 
generally speaking  falling interest rates would lead to net interest income that is higher than it would have been  rising rates would lead to lower net interest income 
however  at the current absolute level of interest rates  lower interest rates may also lead to lower net income due to a diminished ability to lower interest bearing liabilities  including certain client funds  as rates approach zero 
other important determinants of net interest income are rate levels  balance sheet growth and mix  and interest rate spreads 
the following table presents the repricing schedule for our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  dollars in thousands within three months three to six months six to twelve months one year to five years over five years total interest earning assets federal funds sold investment securities    loans variable rate   loans fixed rate total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities demand deposit accounts   savings accounts    interest rate contracts     short term borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities    net interest sensitivity gap during the period   cumulative gap     interest sensitive assets as a percent of interest sensitive liabilities cumulative interest sensitive assets as a percent of total assets cumulative net interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative gap as a percent of total assets adjustable rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid 
mortgage backed securities are included in the pricing category that corresponds with their effective maturity 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of an institution to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
for a financial institution such as us  these obligations arise from the withdrawals of client deposits and the payment of operating expenses 
our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  new deposits  short term borrowings  interest payments on securities held to maturity and available for sale  and fees collected from asset administration clients 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funds  management believes that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to meet our depositors needs  to satisfy our operating requirements and to fund the payment of an anticipated annual cash dividend of per share for approximately million based upon  shares outstanding as of december  
our ability to pay dividends on the common stock may depend on the receipt of dividends from investors bank 
any dividend payments by investors bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the massachusetts commissioner of banks 
in addition  we may not pay dividends on our common stock if we are in default under certain agreements entered into in connection with the sale of our capital securities 
the capital securities were issued by investors capital trust i  a delaware statutory business trust sponsored by us  and qualify as tier i capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
we have informal borrowing arrangements with various counterparties 
each counterparty has agreed to make funds available to us at a rate based on the federal funds overnight rate 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements as of december  was billion 
each bank may terminate its arrangement at any time and is under no contractual obligation to provide us with requested funding 
our borrowings under these arrangements are typically on an overnight basis 
we cannot be certain  however  that such funding will be available 
lack of availability of liquid funds could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we also have master repurchase agreements in place with various counterparties 
each broker has agreed to make funds available to us at various rates in exchange for collateral consisting of marketable securities 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements at december  was billion 
we also have a borrowing arrangement with the fhlbb 
we may borrow amounts determined by prescribed collateral levels and the amount of fhlbb stock we hold 
we are required to hold fhlbb stock equal to no less than i of our outstanding residential mortgage loan principal including mortgage pool securities  ii of total assets  or iii total advances from the fhlbb  divided by a leverage factor of the aggregate amount of borrowing available to us under this arrangement at december  was billion 
our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used for investing activities  consisting primarily of the excess of purchases of investment securities over proceeds from paydowns and maturities of investment securities  was billion for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities  consisting primarily of short term and other borrowings  was billion for the year ended december  capital resources historically  we have financed our operations principally through internally generated cash flows 
we incur capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures and miscellaneous equipment needs 
we lease microcomputers through operating leases 
capital expenditures have been incurred and leases entered into on an as required basis  primarily to meet our growing operating needs 
as a result  our capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were comprised of approximately million in fixed assets  million in capitalized software and projects in process  and million in leasehold improvements 
stockholders equity at december  was million  up  from the ratio of stockholders equity to assets increased to at december  from at december  the frb has adopted a system using internationally consistent risk based capital adequacy guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally upon the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
some off balance sheet items are added to the risk weighted asset base by converting them to a balance sheet equivalent and assigning them the appropriate risk weight 
frb and fdic guidelines require that banking organizations have a minimum ratio of total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
total capital is defined as the sum of tier i and tier ii capital elements  with at least half of the total capital required to be tier i 
tier i capital includes  with certain restrictions  the sum of common stockholders equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less certain intangible assets 
tier ii capital includes  with certain limitations  subordinated debt meeting certain requirements  intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments  certain forms of perpetual preferred stock  as well as maturing capital instruments and general allowances for loan losses 
the following table summarizes our tier i and total capital ratios at december  dollars in thousands amount ratio tier i capital  tier i capital minimum requirement  excess tier i capital  total capital  total capital minimum requirement  excess total capital  risk adjusted assets  net of intangible assets  the following table summarizes investors bank s tier i and total capital ratios at december  dollars in thousands amount ratio tier i capital  tier i capital minimum requirement  excess tier i capital  total capital  total capital minimum requirement  excess total capital  risk adjusted assets  net of intangible assets  in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the frb and the fdic use a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio is defined to be a company s tier i capital divided by its adjusted average total assets 
the leverage ratio adopted by the federal banking agencies requires a ratio of tier i capital to adjusted average total assets for top rated banking institutions 
all other banking institutions are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of to 
the computation of the risk based capital ratios and the leverage ratio requires that the capital and that of investors bank be reduced by most intangible assets 
our leverage ratio at december  was  which is in excess of regulatory minimums 
investors bank s leverage ratio at december  was  which is also in excess of regulatory minimums
