except as otherwise indicted herein  all dates referred to in this report represent periods or dates fixed with reference to the calendar year  rather than our fiscal year ending september overview avanir pharmaceuticals  based in san diego and incorporated in california in  is a biopharmaceutical drug discovery and development company 
avanir is engaged in research  discovery  development  licensing  and sales of innovative drug products  and through its subsidiary  xenerex biosciences xenerex  sales of antibody generation and product development services 
avanir successfully developed the first over the counter otc drug that has been approved by the united states food and drug administration fda for the treatment of cold sores 
marketed in north america by glaxosmithkline  avanir s licensee  abreva docosanol cream was launched in the united states in late according to ac nielson  abreva is the largest selling consumer healthcare product in the us for the treatment of cold sores 
from inception of the glaxosmithkline license agreement through september   avanir has earned million in license fees  milestone payments and royalties on abreva contract sales 
on december   avanir sold an undivided interest in its license agreement with glaxosmithkline to drug royalty usa  and received an initial payment of million 
avanir expects to receive an additional million from drug royalty usa upon a grant of a patent extension for one of avanir s key patents 
avanir retained the right to receive of all royalties under the glaxosmithkline license agreement for annual sales of abreva in excess of million 
avanir also retained its rights to develop and license the cold sore product outside north america and several other indications for the product s active ingredient  docosanol cream 
avanir continues to expand the docosanol franchise worldwide 
we now have license agreements for docosanol cream in canada  italy  the republic of korea  israel and egypt 
since may the product has been approved for marketing as an otc product in canada  korea and israel 
in may  we filed for marketing approval of docosanol cream with the medical products agency mpa in sweden 
we selected sweden as the lead country for our initial european regulatory efforts and intend to pursue the process of mutual recognition in obtaining regulatory reviews in selected states of the european union 
in june  our marketing partner in korea launched docosanol cream under the brand name herepair 
we expect that cts will launch the product under the trade name abrax in january avanir s drug development pipeline consists of clinical  pre clinical and drug discovery programs 
current clinical development programs are centered on neurodex formerly avp  which could potentially provide a novel approach for the treatment of several central nervous system disorders 
the leading clinical development program is for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect pba 
pba is experienced by approximately one million patients with various neurological conditions  including lou 
table of contents gehrig s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als  alzheimer s disease  multiple sclerosis ms  stroke and traumatic brain injury 
pba is a condition for which no fda approved drug is indicated 
our pre clinical research and drug discovery programs are directed primarily toward large therapeutic areas  including allergy and asthma  inflammatory diseases and cholesterol reduction 
licensing our products and partnering with other companies represent important sources of funds for us to achieve cash inflows and pursue development of several potential drugs and technology platforms 
we intend to fund our current pre clinical development programs  if successful  at least until we are able to obtain investigational new drug ind status and begin clinical trials 
thereafter  our strategy is to seek partners for co development or to grant licenses to develop and market our potential new drugs 
co development would allow us to share development costs and product revenues 
licensing would provide an opportunity to receive license fees and milestone payments as the product is developed and royalties on product sales if a product were to be successfully launched 
we also intend for xenerex to establish new research collaborations as it produces human monoclonal antibodies to selected targets 
xenerex now has three collaborative research agreements in place with its partners to generate antibodies to eight target antigens and has a federal research grant to produce antibodies to the toxins produced by the infectious disease anthrax 
xenerex is also producing antibodies to targets identified internally for future research and development by the company 
revenue generating contracts as of december   we had nine active commercial contracts and three active government funded research grants that are generating or could generate important revenues in the future to help fund our research and development programs 
five of the commercial contracts are in the form of docosanol cream abreva license agreements  one contract is for the commercialization of neurodex  and three other contracts are through xenerex and are in the form of antibody research service agreements 
avanir also has been awarded million in government grants to be used for investigating the development of a potential docosanol based genital herpes product and an antibody to anthrax 
we expect that substantially all of our revenues for the next two quarters will be earned from license fees  milestone payments  sales of the raw material docosanol  research fees  grants and royalties under existing contracts and research grants 
for the last two years  glaxosmithkline has been our most significant revenue source  representing over of the company s revenues in fiscal a list of our revenue generating contractual arrangements is set forth as follows

pharmaceutical research and development r d programs  by their very nature  require a substantial amount of financial and human resources and there is no assurance that they will be approved for marketing by domestic and or foreign regulatory agencies 
the costs to develop all of avanir s potential drugs through all clinical phases would cost substantially in excess of funds currently available to the company 
as a result  we do not intend to complete all clinical development stages ourselves for several of our programs 
we intend to use our own funds to develop neurodex through all clinical phases for the treatment of pba 
our strategy for our other drug development programs is to use our own funds in the pre clinical and early clinical stages and then partner or license our technology when our research has been validated either by phase i or phase ii clinical data 
for many of our programs  the higher costs of the later stages of clinical development requires that we license our technology or partner with other pharmaceutical companies that have substantially greater financial resources 
we expect that our licensees will continue to develop and fund those projects and pay us up front license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales if those products are successfully developed and approved for marketing by the fda and other foreign regulatory agencies 
we caution that many of our development efforts could experience delays  setbacks and failures  with no assurance that any of our clinical research or our potential licensees or partners will ever reach the stage of a new drug application nda with the fda or that the nda will be approved 
the following table sets forth the status of  and costs attributable to  our proprietary research and clinical development programs 

table of contents research and development projects and other research programs expense three months ended twelve months ended inception september  september  through estimated september  cost to complete company funded projects project develop neurodex for fda marketing approval in treating pba 
initial phase ii iii clinical trial has been completed and a phase iii clinical trial is underway 
estimated timing to complete all phases of project mid calendar year million develop neurodex for partnering or licensing outside the us as a potential treatment for neuropathic pain at end of phase ii clinical trials phase ii dose ranging trial is currently underway estimated timing to complete project second quarter of calendar year million develop avp as an ige regulator for partnering or licensing as a treatment for allergy and asthma after completion of phase i clinical trials 
estimated timing to complete project is fourth calendar quarter million government funded projects pre clinical research is for potential treatments for genital herpes and anthrax 
estimated timing to complete the various projects varies from one to two years million other pre clinical research projects we use proprietary drug discovery and technology platforms mif  ccm  monoclonal antibody technology to pursue potential treatments for anti inflammation and cholesterol reduction 
the costs and timing to complete our pre clinical research are unpredictable because of the unpredictability of our research other total at september   we held the worldwide rights to manufacture  market and sell all of the products in clinical development and any of the products that might come from our r d programs 
inception dates are on or after october   at which time we began identifying and tracking costs for these research programs 
the company was awarded million in state and federal research grants related to genital herpes and anthrax research 
other includes primarily laboratory occupancy costs and scientific management 

table of contents neurodex research projects neurodex is a patented  orally administered combination of dextromethorphan dm and an enzyme inhibitor that sustains elevated levels of dm on a proposed twelve hour dosing schedule 
avanir is currently developing neurodex for use in two indications pseudobulbar affect pba and neuropathic pain 
treatment of pseudobulbar affect 
in june  avanir successfully completed a pivotal phase ii iii clinical trial for the treatment of pba in patients with als 
preliminary results reported in june showed the endpoint of the study was statistically significant in favor of neurodex when compared to either of the other two treatment arms 
additional statistical analysis of the study results has confirmed efficacy in the primary endpoint as well as efficacy in pre specified secondary endpoints 
as expected  based on its pharmacology  adverse events including nausea  drowsiness and dizziness were reported with greater frequency in the neurodex group 
in november avanir reported the complete results of the study at the als mnd conference in melbourne  australia 
in late  avanir initiated a second phase iii trial for neurodex for the treatment of pba in ms patients 
avanir also intends to initiate in early an open label safety study in patients with symptoms of pba 
if we are successful in completing the remaining studies  we intend to file an nda with the fda by mid assuming the fda approves neurodex for marketing under normal fda review guidelines  the drug could be available for sale by mid and we would expect to begin receiving revenues from sales of the drug in the third calendar quarter of treatment of neuropathic pain 
in july  we initiated a phase ii  open label dose ranging clinical trial of neurodex for the treatment of pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy 
the study is intended to determine the feasibility of developing this indication in order to expand the potential market for neurodex 
partnering strategy 
avanir intends to retain commercial rights to all indications for neurodex in the us and license or otherwise partner neurodex in europe and other commercially feasible territories outside the us avanir anticipates the prospective partner s will continue to carry out clinical development for all feasible indications  including paying for future clinical development costs associated with the licensed territory 
we expect to receive license fees  milestone payments and or royalties on product sales by the licensee if the drug is successfully developed and approved for marketing 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining a licensee for the drug 
if we continue to make progress as planned  we anticipate finding a partner s in europe and possibly other territories and begin receiving material net cash inflows from payments by the licensee by the fourth calendar quarter we caution that many of our development efforts related to neurodex could experience delays  setbacks and failures  with no assurance that our clinical research for either pba or neuropathic pain will ever reach completion in the timeframes planned 
further  we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in finding a licensee  or that the licensee will be successful in carrying out the remainder of the clinical development  file an nda or obtain approval from the fda for marketing the drug 
if we or our licensee were to experience one or more setbacks or failures in the development of the drug  we or our licensee may have to repeat the research at additional cost or abandon the development program 
allergy and asthma pre clinical research ige regulator project a key component in the pathophysiology of both allergy and asthma is the overproduction of immunoglobulin epsilon ige antibodies 
we have identified a family of orally active small molecules that selectively inhibit or prevent the production of ige antibodies and associated mediators and 
table of contents cytokines 
in december  we filed with the fda for an investigational new drug ind application for our lead compound to treat allergy and asthma 
assuming the ind is accepted by the fda for the product and we successfully complete phase i clinical trials  we intend to begin shortly thereafter the process of seeking a licensee for continued development of the drug 
we expect that clinical trials for this drug in the large therapeutic area of allergy and asthma would require substantially more financial resources than will be available to us for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our strategy is to license the drug for further development by another company and receive license fees  milestone payments and or royalties if the drug is successfully developed 
assuming we are successful in our toxicology studies and the fda accepts our ind application  we intend by the fourth calendar quarter of to license the drug to another company that has the resources to fund and carry out the development program 
we anticipate that such a license arrangement would provide avanir with license fees and or milestone payments as well as royalties on product sales if the technology is successfully developed and approved for marketing by the fda 
we caution that many of our development efforts related to ige could experience delays  setbacks and failures  with no assurance that our research will ever reach completion of our intended plan  that we will be successful in finding a licensee  or that the licensee will be successful in carrying out the remainder of the clinical development  file an nda or obtain approval from the fda 
if we or our licensee were to experience one or more setbacks or failures in the development of the drug  we or our licensee may have to repeat the research at additional cost or abandon the development program 
government funded research projects we have been awarded three government funded research grants totaling million that are intended to reimburse us for costs of certain pre clinical research related to a potential treatment for genital herpes and antibodies for anthrax 
our million phase ii small business innovative research sbir grant and  california technology investment partnership caltip grant are for pre clinical and market research related to the development of a topical treatment for genital herpes hsv over a two year period 
we are using the sbir grant to fund certain pre clinical research related to genital herpes 
we are using the caltip funds for defining and assessing the market including assessment of competitive landscape  product opportunities  fda regulatory review expectations  brand identification and possible brand names for a potential genital herpes product 
additionally  in fiscal  we were awarded a  grant from the california center for advanced technology for research and development in fiscal and related to finding one or more antibodies to the toxins produced by anthrax 
other pre clinical research projects anti inflammatory research mif inhibitor in mid we acquired a proprietary series of compounds that appear to inhibit or block the activity of macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif 
mif is a protein that plays a central role in inflammation pathways 
our research indicates that mif may serve as a potential drug target in a variety of diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  crohn s disease  colitis  asthma and sepsis 
our goal is to identify and develop an orally administered compound that can be developed as an innovative therapy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
our mif technology platform is currently in the early pre clinical stage of development and is at too early of a stage of development to predict the cost and timing to complete the project 
cholesterol reduction ccm technology our research on cholesterol lowering agents is a very early stage drug discovery program that has been implemented to discover agents that will be valuable in the treatment and prevention of hyper cholesterolemia high cholesterol 
cholesterol is transported in the blood in large cholesterol rich particles called lipoproteins 
generally  low density lipoproteins ldl deliver the cholesterol to peripheral tissues including aorta and coronary arteries  whereas high density 
table of contents lipoproteins hdl remove excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues  and transport it to the liver for elimination 
we have a proprietary technology  code named ccm  that we are using to identify peptides that may be capable of accelerating the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transporting it to the liver for elimination 
because our ccm technology platform is at a very early stage of research  we are unable to predict the cost and timing for development of a drug 
this product is currently in the pre clinical development stage for a possible method of reducing undesirable levels of cholesterol 
monoclonal antibodies research as of september   we were engaged in research collaborations with three companies that desire to use our proprietary technology to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies to potential disease targets 
these research collaborations typically provide us with advance payments to conduct research and provide for milestone payments in the event that we are successful in meeting certain predetermined stages of development 
xenerex is also conducting research on developing antibodies to targets internally identified for possible addition to the company s own drug discovery and development programs 
because all of our research is at a very early pre clinical stage of development and is unpredictable in terms of the outcome  we are unable to predict the cost and timing for development of any antibody or drug 
other collaborative research programs on january   we entered into a collaborative research and development agreement with shanghai new asiatic pharmaceutical company  ltd  a division of shanghai pharmaceutical co  ltd 
under the agreement  we provided clinical and pre clinical research information on docosanol cream to shanghai new asiatic 
shanghai new asiatic is responsible for evaluating the regulatory approval requirements and size of the markets for the treatment of cold sores  genital herpes and herpes zoster shingles 
there can be no assurance that either the regulatory approval requirements or the size of market will be attractive to shanghai new asiatic to ensure the product will be developed 
critical accounting policies because of the significance of our revenue recognition policies to our financial statements  we believe it is appropriate to include our revenue recognition policies as critical accounting policies 
milestone payments in license agreements we recognize revenues from license fees when the performance requirements have been met  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of fees is probable 
we defer revenues and recognize them ratably over the life of the agreement when we have continuing obligations to perform under the agreement 
our largest and most significant license agreement is with glaxosmithkline 
on march   we transferred the rights to glaxosmithkline to manufacture  use  and sell abreva in the united states and canada and gave them full control  authority and responsibility over research  development  registration including actions required to obtain appropriate government approvals  and commercialization of the product in that territory 
glaxosmithkline has achieved and paid all of the performance milestones under the agreement 
with regard to the milestones  we have no further performance obligations 
future revenues to be earned under the glaxosmithkline agreement will come solely from royalty revenues 
we expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future 
we expect that each license agreement will have its own set of circumstances and terms of performance 
we will consider the specific facts and circumstances of each license agreement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for such items  including nonrefundable up front fees and milestone payments and taking into consideration when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonable assured 

table of contents royalties on licensed products we recognize royalty revenues from our licensed products based on the reported sales by our licensee and computed in accordance with the specific terms of the license agreement 
since the launch of abreva in october up to september   all of our royalties have come from glaxosmithkline 
we have entered into additional license agreements that contain royalties as a source of revenues  and we expect to enter into additional similar license agreements with foreign based companies 
sales of future royalty revenues in order to increase our cash position and to further fund our current development programs  we sold an undivided interest in our license agreement with glaxosmithkline to drug royalty usa and received an initial payment of million 
because of the ongoing involvement with drug royalty usa in earning future royalty revenues  we have classified the amount received from the purchaser as deferred revenue 
the amount classified as deferred revenue will be amortized under the units of revenue method  whereby amortization for a period is calculated by computing the ratio of proceeds received from the purchaser to the total payments expected to be made to the purchaser over the term of the license purchase agreement and then applying that ratio to the periodic cash payment 
research contracts in certain circumstances  we may enter into research contracts or collaborations having obligations to deliver to the customer multiple products and or services multiple deliverables in exchange for fees or milestone payments 
such contracts could include antibody generation services agreements and other forms of research collaborations 
as of september   xenerex had entered into three research collaboration arrangements  all of which have research initiation fees 
in these agreements  the customer provides antigens to xenerex 
xenerex performs research to develop potential antibodies for those antigens initial phase 
if  after a reasonable commercial effort is made to develop an antibody  it is determined that none exists  the contract is complete and the initiation fee is recognized 
if antibodies are developed  they are provided to the customer and a determination is made by the customer to have xenerex perform further research or terminate the remaining contract 
if the customer decides to have xenerex continue research on the developed antibodies  there exists in the contract milestones that are tied to the completion of the different phases of effort 
examples of milestones include when the customer files the biologics license application and when the customer obtains regulatory approval 
the research collaboration agreements also define the amount of royalties on product sales by the licensee  assuming the licensee successfully develops and obtains approval for marketing a product 
the license fees and royalty rates  while defined as part of the research collaboration agreement  would still be subject to completion of a definitive license agreement with the customer 
xenerex research initiation fees xenerex defers research initiation fees and recognizes the revenue once xenerex has completed its efforts to create antibodies 
under existing research agreements  if xenerex fails to create antibodies  then the contract may be terminated with no additional performance obligations  indicating that the earnings process is complete  provided xenerex has made a commercially reasonable effort to create antibodies 
the status of xenerex s three existing collaborative agreements are as follows 
table of contents peregrine pharmaceuticals the peregrine contract provides for the creation of antibodies to three target antigens provided by peregrine 
as of september   xenerex had advanced to the second stage of the research collaboration agreement for one of the three target antigens 
the second stage is intended to provide peregrine with more information on selected panels of the antibodies that meet the antibody characteristics desired by peregrine 
we earned and recognized a pro rata portion of the research initiation fee as revenue associated with our efforts and included the amount in our contract and license fee revenues for fiscal we have not completed the performance associated with stage two or other milestones in the agreement and have not earned or recognized any other revenues in fiscal eos biotechnology  inc the eos contract provides for the creation of antibodies to three target antigens provided by eos 
as of september   xenerex had advanced to the second stage of the research collaboration agreement for two of the three target antigens 
the second stage is intended to provide eos with more information on selected panels of the antibodies that meet the antibody characteristics desired by eos 
we earned and recognized the research initiation fee as revenue associated with our commercial efforts on all three antigens and included the amount in our contract and license fee revenues in the prior fiscal year ended september  we have not completed the performance associated with stage two or other milestones in the agreement and have not earned or recognized any revenues in fiscal dnax research  inc the dnax contract provides for the creation of antibodies to two target antigens provided by dnax 
we have not completed the commercial efforts associated with the research initiation fees or achieved any of the milestones in the agreement 
therefore  as of september   we had not earned or recognized any revenues under the agreement 
xenerex s receipt of milestone payments in the research phases of the research collaboration agreement  xenerex may receive payment either to start a research phase or to complete a research phase including receipt by the customer of the deliverable 
xenerex recognizes revenue once the product has been delivered  because the earning process would be complete and an exchange has been made 
factors taken into consideration in recognizing revenues include the following the performance criteria have been met  any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products or services  payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent on delivery of the remaining products or services  and we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event we do not deliver the remaining undelivered products or services 
commercial phase of xenerex research contracts xenerex research collaboration agreements provide that a final license agreement will be executed to incorporate the terms and conditions for the commercial phase of the contract 
we will evaluate revenue recognition for the commercial phase once a license agreement is executed and the commercial phase has commenced 
other research contracts as with all our research contracts  including the up front initiation fee  we defer revenue recognition until services have been rendered or products eg developed antibodies are delivered 
the milestones established within the contract are set to approximate the effort associated with the completion of each phase 
regardless of when we receive the payment associated with a research phase  we defer the revenue recognition until the service is completed or product is delivered 

table of contents nature of operating expenses avanir s operating expenses are influenced substantially by the amount of spending devoted to our clinical development programs and drug discovery research 
during the past two years  we have substantially expanded our drug development pipeline  which requires that we allocate significant amounts of our resources to research and development activities 
our spending on new business development and on general and administrative support staff tends to follow trends in our spending for research  but to a lesser extent 
other components of our operating costs include maintenance and operation of our laboratory and office facilities  depreciation  professional and consulting fees related to clinical trials and regulatory compliance  insurance  and investor relations 
we expect annual operating expenses will increase for the foreseeable future  in light of our expanded product development pipeline 
our business is exposed to significant risks  as discussed in the section entitled risk factors that might affect future operations  which may result in additional expenses  delays and lost opportunities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales revenues and on net income from continuing operations has been immaterial during the past three years 
prices for electricity increased in early fiscal  however  our operations do not consume a substantial amount of electricity other than for providing lighting and air conditioning for our offices and laboratories 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and net income loss vs 
for fiscal  the net loss attributable to common shareholders was million  or per share  compared to  in net income attributable to common shareholders in fiscal of  or approximately breakeven on a per share basis 
we expect to continue to pursue our drug development strategy focused on large market therapeutic areas with significant partnering and licensing potential 
to help fund and develop our products  we intend to seek licensees and partners to share the costs of development 
some of these potential license arrangements could materially change our outlook for future revenues and costs 
however  the timing of such potential arrangements is unpredictable 
to reach the stage of partnering or licensing our product candidates or technologies or marketing our own products  we expect to continue to invest at current or higher rates in our existing research and clinical development programs  which we expect will result in a loss for fiscal revenues vs 
revenues in fiscal decreased to million  compared to million in fiscal the million decrease in revenues for fiscal resulted primarily from the completion of milestone payments under the license agreement with our licensee  glaxosmithkline  in october revenues for fiscal included a final million milestone payment upon reaching the one year anniversary of abreva product launch and million in royalty revenues on abreva product sales 
other revenues in fiscal included  in sales of the active ingredient docosanol   in federal and state grant revenues  and  in contract and license fees from other areas 
revenues in fiscal included million in milestone payments and million in royalty revenues on abreva product

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described below  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
because substantially all our revenue  expenses  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is immaterial 
however  in the future we could face increasing exposure to foreign currency exchange rates as we expand international distribution of docosanol cream and purchase additional services from outside the us until such time as we are faced with material amounts of foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments  which can be used to hedge such risks 
we will evaluate the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposures as the needs and risks should arise 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income instruments with an average duration of years as of september  years as of september  
the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while achieving attractive yields  without significantly increasing risk 
we carry some investments that we intend to hold to maturity and others that we classify as available for sale 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk 
in general  we would expect that the volatility of this portfolio would increase as its duration increases
