item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  but not limited to  statements relating to future sales  gross margins  product development  operating expense levels and the sufficiency of financial resources to support future operations  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by that statute 
such statements are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and under the heading risks associated with portal s business and future operating results that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
overview portal develops  markets and supports customer management and billing product based solutions for communications and content service providers 
portal was incorporated in california in march beginning with fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have come from the license of one product  infranet and from related services 
revenues consist of infranet license  consulting  training  support and maintenance fees 
license revenues are comprised of perpetual or multiyear license fees  which are primarily derived from contracts with corporate customers and resellers 
we believe that future license revenues will be generated from three sources license fees from new customers  license fees for additional or new products to existing customers  and growth in the subscriber base of our existing customers  which will lead to increased revenue from subscriber based licenses or other licenses where the fees owed to us are based on increased revenues  transactions or other measures of usage 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant portal obligations with regard to implementation exist or remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we recognize license revenue using the residual method 
for electronic delivery  the software is considered to have been delivered when we have provided the customer with the access codes that allow for immediate possession of the software 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue from arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users resellers is not recognized until evidence of an arrangement with an end user has been received 
our policy should we enter into a transaction with a customer to purchase the customer s products contemporaneously with the customer s purchase of software from portal  is to recognize the amount of license fees paid to portal net of the fees paid for the customer s products 
services revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from systems integration or other consulting fees  maintenance agreements and training 
arrangements that include software services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
when software services are considered essential  revenue under the arrangement is recognized using contract accounting 
when software services are not considered essential  which has been the case in the majority of our license arrangements  the revenue related to the license is recorded upon delivery and the revenue related to the fair value of the software services is recognized as the services are performed 
fair value is based on the price charged when these services are sold separately 
maintenance agreements provide for technical support and include the right to unspecified upgrades on an if and when available basis 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized  as services revenue  on a straight line basis over the life of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
customer advances and certain billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
our cost of license fees includes a royalty payment for third party technology included in infranet 
resellers commissions are also included in cost of license fees when we are paid directly by a customer for a contract originated by a systems integrator 
agreements with some of the integrators require us to make a payment equal to a percentage of the license and maintenance revenues recognized 
we essentially did not incur any shipping  packaging or documentation printing costs  as our product is delivered electronically over the internet 
cost of services consists primarily of headcount related expenses  costs related to outside consultants  travel and overhead associated with delivering consulting and training and providing support to our customers 
we have a limited operating history as a software company 
we incurred a net loss of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our planned expense levels for each of the fiscal quarters of fiscal year exceed the revenues we generated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues from licenses of our products and sale of our services to achieve and maintain operating profitability 
we have established a series of relationships with hardware platform  software and service providers and systems integrators 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenues from customers that have significant relationships with our market and platform partners 
as a result of continuing consolidation in the communications and content delivery industries and the reduction in capital available for emerging companies  we expect to derive an increasing portion of our total revenues from large communications and content service providers 
in this regard  we anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenues will be derived from a fewer number of customers than in prior years 
we also plan to structure more of our transactions to provide for payments over a period of one year or more and to increase the number of licenses that have a fixed duration  rather than a perpetual term and that are based on usage limitations other than the number of subscribers 
one of the impacts of this change in license structuring could be that license revenue would be recognized ratably over the term of the license arrangement  or as payments from customers become due rather than being recorded as revenue upon delivery 
the portion of our total revenues that is derived from international operations has increased in recent years 
as a result  we will face greater exposure to the risks associated with international operations 
with respect to our services revenues  most of our professional services fees have been paid pursuant to time and materials arrangements 
we believe that in the future a larger portion of our services revenues will be based on fixed price contracts than in prior years 
this could result in the deferral of revenue until contract completion  in the event that we were unable to reliably budget and estimate our obligations under these contracts or determine the fair value of the services being performed 
for a description of factors that may affect our future results see risks associated with our business and future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate and may revise our estimates  including those related to the allowance for bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  accrued restructuring expenses and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements are very complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  several of which are discussed above  in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
for example  we are required to exercise judgment in evaluating risk of concessions to our customers when payment terms are beyond the normal credit period of net days 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
our customer base is highly concentrated in the communications and content service provider industries 
several of the leading companies in these industries have announced liquidity concerns 
if collection is not probable at the time the transaction is consummated  we do not recognize revenue until cash collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accrued restructuring expenses during the fiscal year ended january   we announced plans to restructure the company that were a combination of a reduction in workforce  consolidation of facilities and the write off of assets 
the restructuring charges during the year were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with these restructuring plans 
these estimates have been impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
we have not recorded payments related to potential settlements  as these amounts are not reasonably estimable and probable 
if  in the future  we were to agree upon additional severance payments  we would have to record additional restructuring charges in the period in which the settlement was determined to be reasonably estimable and probable 
we have reduced the amount of the facilities restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas we have vacant space 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges as related to the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring charges 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
results of operations revenues in millions  except percentages year ended january  change to year ended january  change to year ended january  license fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues total revenues total revenues decreased significantly in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a decrease in license fees 
license fees revenues decreased in absolute amounts and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal from fiscal as a result of a continued general economic slowdown affecting the primary markets for our products and services  and in particular  capital spending by communication service providers 
one individual customer  america online  inc  accounted for of total revenues during fiscal no individual customer accounted for or more of total revenues during fiscal license fees revenues increased in absolute amounts and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal from fiscal primarily as a result of the maturation of the infranet product and the expansion of our sales and marketing operations 
one customer accounted for of total revenues for the year ended january  service revenues decreased slightly in fiscal from fiscal due a decline in consulting services as result of fewer new customer implementations 
service revenues increased in fiscal from fiscal due to an increase in consulting  training  support and maintenance service fees related to the growth in new customers and to new implementations of infranet and the renewal of maintenance and support contracts by existing customers

north american revenues increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to continued expansion in north american marketing activities and growth of our sales force as well as greater acceptance of infranet 
international revenues for europe is defined by us as europe  middle east and africa and intercontinental is defined by us as asia pacific  japan and latin america 
international revenues also decreased substantially in fiscal from fiscal due to a continued global deferral of capital expenditures by telecommunications companies as well as general economic slowdown 
international revenues increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the growth of our direct sales force and increased marketing efforts worldwide

the decrease in cost of license fees in fiscal from fiscal is due to the decrease in revenue generated from our base of systems integrator partners 
cost of license fees increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to increased license revenue and increased resellers commissions resulting from expanding our base of systems integrator partners 
cost of services cost of services primarily consists of maintenance  consulting and training expenses 
cost of services increased slightly in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to an increase in the number of consulting and technical support personnel  in the beginning of the fiscal year  to support the actual and previously anticipated expansion of our installed base of customers and new implementations 
this increase was offset by a reduction in our services workforce as a result of a reduced number of professional consulting projects 
cost of services increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to an increase in the number of consulting and technical support personnel necessary to support both the expansion of our installed base of customers and new implementations 
gross margin for services was approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin for services  during fiscal  was due to reduced utilization of professional services personnel as a result of the decrease in new implementation projects 
the decrease in gross margin  during fiscal  was primarily due to the costs associated with the acquisition and assimilation of solution  which we acquired in november amortization of purchased developed technology in fiscal  we recorded an asset of million for purchased developed technology as a result of acquiring solution see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the value was determined  with the assistance of independent third party appraisers  by using the income approach which estimates the present value of cash flows from developed technology as based on management and industry assumptions and market data 
this purchased developed technology is being amortized  on a straight line basis  over its estimated useful life of four years 
as a result of acquiring baygate  inc baygate in may see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  we recorded an additional asset of million for purchased developed technology that was being amortized over its estimated useful life of three years 
in the quarters ended october  and january   we recorded charges of million and million to reflect the impairment of purchased developed technology related to our investment in baygate and solution  respectively see reduction in intangibles due to impairment below 
as of january   we no longer have purchased developed technology related to our investment in baygate due to a combination of impairment charges and amortization during fiscal future amortization expense of the remaining purchased developed technology related to our investment in solution is currently estimated to be million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our development and certain technical support efforts 
the increase in research and development  for all periods  was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel necessary to support both expanded functionality of infranet and increases in our quality assurance and product publications operations 
although we anticipate that the recent restructuring of our operations will reduce research and development expenses over the near term  these expenses may increase over the longer term 
we have not capitalized any software development costs to date 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force  marketing staff and marketing programs  including trade shows  advertising and costs associated with the recruitment of new and maintenance of existing  strategic partnerships 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a decrease in commission expense as a result of the decline in license revenues and a reduction in workforce as a result of our restructuring plans 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal due to a number of factors  including an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel  the opening of new sales offices worldwide and increased marketing programs 
although we anticipate that the recent restructuring of our operations will reduce sales and marketing expenses over the near term  these expenses may increase over the longer term 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources  as well as information system and facilities expenses not allocated to other departments 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal  which was attributable to an increase in bad debt reserves see note in notes to consolidated financial statements and depreciation of equipment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in facility lease expenses due to the implementation of our restructuring plans in fiscal see restructuring costs below and note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to a higher number of general and administrative personnel and to additional legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with business activities 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we incur greater legal and accounting costs in connection with expanding business activities 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in fiscal year in connection with stock options and restricted stock issued in and prior to and million  in the quarter ended july  in connection with the acquisition of baygate 
the deferred stock compensation reflects the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire certain shares of common stock and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
we amortized deferred compensation expense of approximately million  million and million during the years ended january   and  respectively 
this compensation expense relates to options awarded to individuals in all operating expense categories 
during the quarter ended january   the unamortized deferred compensation balance was reduced by million for individuals who are no longer employed at portal 
total deferred compensation at january  of approximately million is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options  which is generally four years  using a graded vesting method and will be fully amortized in fiscal in process research and development in fiscal  we recorded a one time charge of million for in process research and development projects  related to the acquisition of solution  for which technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the acquisition  the total fair value of these projects was estimated to be million 
the value of the projects was determined  with the assistance of independent third party appraisers  by estimating the costs to develop the in process technology into commercially feasible products and estimating the present value of the net cash flows management believed would result from the products 
amortization of goodwill goodwill  as related to the acquisition of solution  accounted for approximately and of total assets and stockholders equity  respectively  as of january  in fiscal year and  amortization expense of goodwill was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of million see reduction in intangibles due to impairment below 
goodwill was further reduced by million due to the reversal of excess accrued direct acquisition costs 
as of january   there is no remaining balance in goodwill 
reduction in intangibles due to impairment long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the presence of indicators exist that would suggest the impairment of assets  the estimated future net cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if impairment has occurred 
if such assets were deemed impaired  an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized 
if quoted market prices for the assets are not available  the fair value is calculated using the present value of estimated expected future net cash flows 
the cash flow calculations are based on management s best estimates  using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
during the second quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of solution these indicators included deterioration in the business climate and prospects and intentions for this subsidiary 
our reduction in force of our solution employee base in the second quarter of fiscal contributed to these factors 
with the assistance of independent valuation experts  we performed asset impairment tests at the solution subsidiary level  the lowest level for which there were identifiable cash flows related to these acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
the tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived assets resulting from the solution acquisition 
based on the results of these tests  we determined that long lived assets initially recorded in connection with this acquisition were significantly impaired 
we measured the impairment loss related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded its fair value 
measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future discounted cash flows at the solution level 
in performing this analysis  we used the best information available in the circumstances including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
the discounted cash flow analysis considered the likelihood of possible outcomes and was based on our best estimate of projected future cash flows 
the discount rate was based on historical risk premiums required by investors for companies of our size  industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to us 
the analysis indicated that our long lived assets for solution were impaired by an amount totaling million 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment write down of this amount during the second quarter of fiscal during the quarter ended october   we further reduced goodwill by million due to the reversal of excess accrued direct acquisition costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified additional indicators of impairment of our remaining solution long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded charges of million and million to reflect the impairment of goodwill and purchased developed technology  respectively  related to our investment 
due to the lack of revenues generated from baygate products together with the october reduction of workforce associated with baygate s product  we cancelled the further planned development of baygate related products 
based on these key factors  we recorded a charge of million during the quarter ended october   to reflect the impairment of purchased developed technology related to our investment in baygate 
we did not record any write downs of long lived assets during fiscal and restructuring costs in may and october  portal s board of directors approved plans to reduce our cost structure as a result of a change in market conditions 
the plans were a combination of reductions in our workforce  consolidations of facilities and asset write offs 
the workforce reductions affected all of our functional areas and all affected employees were notified prior to the end of the respective quarters 
as a result of the restructuring plans  we incurred charges of million  million and million  in the quarters ended july   october  and january   respectively 
the may plan reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
the million restructuring charge incurred during the quarter ended july  included approximately million of severance related amounts  million of committed excess facilities  primarily related to lease expenses net of anticipated sublease income  and million in asset write offs 
the october plan reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
the million and million charges in the quarters ended october  and january   respectively  included approximately million of severance related amounts  million of committed excess facilities  primarily related to lease expenses net of anticipated sublease income  and million in asset write offs 
as of january   the remaining restructuring reserves were million of which million represents committed excess facilities  net of anticipated sublease income  million represents severance related costs and million represents asset write offs see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments regarding severance are to occur through the second quarter of fiscal and payments for the excess facilities are expected to occur through april while we believe that our business realignment will assist us in streamlining operations  reducing expenses and thereby achieving profitability  we cannot assure you that we will achieve these anticipated results 
we may in the future be required to take additional actions  including further changes to the business organization  in order to realign the business with anticipated requirements 
if we are not successful in realigning our business to increase revenues and decrease costs  we may never achieve profitability 
interest and other income  net interest and other income include interest and dividend income from cash  cash equivalents and investments offset by interest expense paid on capital leases and notes payable 
interest and other income were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
other income  for fiscal  includes a million one time gain upon remeasurement of the liability related to the put option granted to accenture  which was settled upon the completion of our initial public offering in may interest and other income decreased approximately million or in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to declining interest rates on lower cash balances 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from the initial and secondary stock offerings  completed in may and october  being invested for a full year 
provision for income taxes the income tax provision was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the income tax provision for each of these fiscal years primarily relates to foreign withholding taxes on revenue and tax on earnings generated from operations in certain foreign jurisdictions 
although we recorded net losses of million  million and million for fiscal  and  our foreign operations were profitable for tax purposes primarily due to the intercompany charge back arrangements necessary under the local tax laws 
based on a number of factors  we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
these factors include consideration of past operating results  the competitive nature of our market and predictability of future operating results 
therefore  we have not recognized the full value of deferred tax assets as of january  we will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments including restricted investments of million totaled million at january   compared to a balance of million at january  we used cash totaling million in operations during the year ended january   an increase of million over the million generated in the year ended january  net cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily comprised of net losses adjusted for non cash expenses  a decrease in other accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million and a decrease in accrued compensation of million 
these decreases were offset by a decrease in net accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accrued liabilities was due to a reduction in spending in response to the worsening economic conditions 
the decrease in deferred revenue was due to a lack of new revenues to fully offset recognition of past deferrals 
accrued compensation decreased primarily due to the reductions in our workforce that were part of our restructuring plans see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to a combination of factors including a significant decrease in revenues  an increase in collections and an increase in the allowance for bad debts 
adjustments made for non cash expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  amortization of deferred stock compensation  purchased developed technology and goodwill  reduction in intangibles due to impairment  restructuring and write down of impaired investments amounted to million for fiscal the total cash outlay for both restructuring plans is estimated to be million which includes severance related costs as well as lease liabilities related to the consolidation of facilities and is expected to be funded by available cash 
of the million  lease payments for impacted facilities  net of expected sublease income  are expected to be million over the next nine years 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended january   an increase of million from the million used in the year ended january  net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended january  was primarily comprised of the maturities and sales of short term investments  net of purchases 
we have also continued to make significant investments in software  equipment and facilities 
during the year ended january   we purchased computer equipment and software  made leasehold improvements and purchased other capital equipment amounting to approximately million  primarily to support our ongoing operations and information systems 
historically  we have also used debt and leases to partially finance our operations and capital purchases 
no capital leases were entered into during fiscal we have raised equity capital from investors to fund our operations 
in fiscal and  we raised an additional million and million  respectively  from sales of common stock issued from our employee stock purchase plan and upon the exercise of stock options by employees  net of repurchases 
in fiscal  we completed an initial public offering and concurrent private sales of stock to cisco systems  inc and accenture that collectively raised million 
we also completed a follow on public offering in october  which raised approximately million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses 
in fiscal year  we also we raised an additional million from sales of common stock issued from our employee stock purchase plan and upon the exercise of stock options by employees and warrants by third parties  net of repurchases 
in november  we acquired solution the liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition included short term and long term notes payable 
in may  we paid in full the short term notes payable  which were comprised of two short term notes each bearing interest at per annum and were unsecured 
the long term notes payable are four mortgages for two facilities located in germany 
two of the mortgages accrue interest at per annum 
principal and interest are due in december and june on these two mortgages 
as of january   the balances due on these loans were million each 
the other two mortgages accrue interest at and per annum 
principal and interest payments are made on a monthly basis 
these two mortgages are due in october and november as of january   the balances due were million and million  respectively 
on may   we purchased all of the outstanding stock of privately held baygate for million in cash 
an additional payment of million in cash was made based on achievement of certain revenue and engineering objectives 
due to the lack of revenues generated from baygate products together with the october reduction of workforce associated with baygate s product  we cancelled the further planned development of baygate related products 
under a new agreement  a final payment of million was made in january in satisfaction of all our obligations to the baygate shareholders under the purchase agreement see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and international locations 
these leases are for terms expiring april through march in connection with our facility leases  we issued five letters of credit in lieu of a security deposit for the facilities see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
under all our facilities lease agreements  net of sublease income of million  we are obligated to make payments of approximately million  million  million  million and million in the years ending january     and  respectively and a total of million thereafter until expiration of the leases 
due to the restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal  several facilities were vacated or are under utilized 
some of these facilities have been subleased 
we are also attempting to sublease additional surplus facilities comprising approximately  square feet 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including related interest charges  as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
of the million in non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income  million has been included in accrued restructuring expenses as of january  in thousands total less than year years years over years long term notes payable capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income the following table summarizes our other commitments as of january  and the effect such commitments could have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods if the letters of credit or the guarantees were drawn upon 
restricted investments represent the collateral for these commitments 
total less than year years years over years in thousands letters of credit guarantees our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing international operations and other factors 
our planned expense levels for each of the fiscal quarters of fiscal year exceed the revenues we generated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  we will need to generate increased revenues from licenses of our products and sale of our services to achieve and maintain operating profitability 
as of the date of filing this report  we currently expect in the first quarter of fiscal year to use less than million of cash for operations  approximately million for restructuring and other activities and to have approximately million in cash and investments including restricted cash at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year although we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months  we may require additional financing within this time frame 
we may seek financing at any time that we determine market conditions are favorable 
additional funding  if needed  may cause dilution to our stockholders or the incurrence of debt and such funding may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
risks associated with our business and future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and assumptions 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described in this risks associated with our business and future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to update these statements or publicly release the results of any revisions to the forward looking statements that we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
it is difficult to predict our business because we have a limited history operating as a provider of customer management and billing software our results of operations for the fiscal year ended january  contained in this report are not necessarily indicative of results for our fiscal year ending january  or any other future period 
moreover  we have a relatively brief operating history as a provider of customer management and billing software and had no meaningful license revenue until therefore  we will experience the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  including those discussed in this report 
our business strategy may not prove successful and we may not successfully address these risks 
we cannot be certain that we will be profitable in order to be profitable  we must increase our revenues or reduce our expenses 
we may not be able to increase or even maintain our revenues and we may not achieve sufficient revenues for profitability in any future period 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million for fiscal year  and  respectively 
we expect to experience a net loss for fiscal year we recorded a substantial restructuring charge in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year in connection with a reduction in force and other expense reduction efforts initiated during the year 
we expect that our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year will be approximately equal to or lower than our revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our projected expenses for the first quarter of fiscal are targeted to exceed the amount of our anticipated first quarter revenues 
as a result  if we do not generate increased revenues from sales of our products or reduce expenses  we will not be profitable 
the decrease in capital expenditures by communications companies as well as the general economic slowdown has adversely affected our revenues and will make it difficult to increase revenues until spending in our target markets increases 
we also expect that we will face increased competition that may make it more difficult to increase our revenues 
even if we are able to increase revenues  we may experience price competition which would lower our gross margins and our profitability 
another factor that would lower our gross margins is any increase in the percentage of our revenues that is derived from indirect channels and from services  both of which have lower margins 
we have also undertaken a number of cost reduction efforts 
failure to achieve the desired reductions in our expenses will further increase our losses 
we cannot be certain that we will again achieve operating or net profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our revenues will be adversely affected as a result of economic conditions and stock market valuations affecting our target markets we primarily market our products and services to providers of communication and content services 
the substantial number of business failures and the decline in the market value of dot com and other technology companies in the past two years has made it more difficult for emerging communication and electronic content companies to obtain financing for their operations 
moreover  the market value  financial results and prospects of many large and established companies  including many large telecommunications companies  have also declined or degraded significantly 
emerging growth and established communications and content companies have continued to reduce or defer their purchases of software and related products and the introduction of many new communication services has been delayed or cancelled 
any general decrease by our customers and potential customers in their rate of software and network investments results in a significant decrease in our revenues and operating income 
these trends in technology and software spending dramatically hurt our business in fiscal year and will continue to seriously harm our business until conditions improve 
the current economic and capital spending downturn affecting our markets has made it increasingly difficult for us to collect accounts receivable and increased the time required to collect them 
a number of customers have ceased to operate or have become insolvent 
failure to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner has in the past and may continue to result in increased write offs  higher accounts receivable reserves and lower cash reserves that would adversely affect our financial results and available cash resources 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
for example  we achieved profitability in each of the first three quarters of fiscal year and reported net losses in the last five quarters 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of one or more public market analysts and investors and the price of our common stock may fall 
failure by technology companies to meet or exceed analyst expectations or any resulting changes in analyst recommendations or ratings frequently results in substantial decreases in the market value of the stock of such companies 
for example  the market value of our stock decreased significantly after the release of our financial results for the quarters ended october  and april  factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include variations in demand for our products and services  including decreases caused by reductions in technology spending within our target markets  the timing and execution of individual contracts  particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter  the timing of sales of our products and services  our ability to develop and attain market acceptance of enhancements to infranet and new products and services  market acceptance of new communications services for which our products are intended to support  delays in introducing new products and services  new product introductions by competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  announcements of new versions of products that cause customers to postpone purchases of our current products  the mix of products and services sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  the timing of releases of new versions of third party software and hardware products that work with our products  our ability to attract  integrate  train  retain and motivate a substantial number of sales and marketing  research and development  technical support and other management personnel with the needed competencies  our ability to expand our operations  the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  and global economic conditions generally  as well as those specific to providers of communications and content services 
we have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders for new license transactions 
in any given quarter  our sales have involved  and we expect will continue to involve  large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses of infranet would reduce our revenues  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance 
also  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month 
accordingly  delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
we have recorded as deferred revenue the fees from contracts that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements 
while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts that we enter into may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract is signed and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term 
as a result  a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods due to seasonal variations and we may fail to meet expectations we may also experience seasonality in our business 
in many software companies  the rate of growth or absolute amount of license fee revenues tends to decline from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the next year  due in part to the structure of sales compensation plans 
our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year was significantly lower than the preceding fourth quarter 
we currently expect that total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year will be equal to or lower than those in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year if we experience such seasonality in the future  our rate of growth or absolute revenues could decline in the first quarter of a fiscal year compared to the preceding fourth quarter 
in addition  the european operations of many companies experience some flatness in the summer months 
we may also experience such a pattern in our european operations 
such seasonality may cause our results of operations to fluctuate or become more difficult to predict and could cause us to fail to meet internal or analyst expected financial results 
it is difficult to predict the timing of individual orders because infranet has a long and variable sales cycle to date  the sales cycle for infranet generally has been three to nine months or more 
the long sales and implementation cycles for infranet may cause license revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
furthermore  the revenues derived from a sale may not be recognized immediately and could be spread over an extended period 
along with systems integrators and our other distribution partners  we spend significant time educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of infranet 
even after purchase  our customers tend to deploy infranet slowly and deliberately  depending on the specific technical capabilities of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy infranet 
our business depends on the commercial acceptance of our products and it is uncertain to what extent the market will accept them our future growth depends on the commercial success of our infranet family of products 
substantially all of our license fees revenues are derived from our infranet product family 
our business will be harmed if our target customers do not adopt and purchase infranet 
prospective customers may base their purchasing decisions based on a vendor s ability to support their customer management and billing needs for both their new services and their other existing service offerings  such as fixed wire or mobile voice telephony or cable television 
our ability to address these current and future service requirements with our current version of infranet and planned future enhancements may affect the market acceptance of infranet by prospective customers who desire an integrated customer management and billing solution for their different services 
our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products 
we are not certain that our target customers will widely adopt and deploy infranet as their customer management and billing solution 
in the future we may not be successful in marketing infranet or any new or enhanced products or services 
our future revenues will also depend on our customers licensing software for additional applications or for additional subscribers 
their failure to do so could harm our business 
our customers deploy infranet across a variety of computer hardware platforms and integrate it with a number of legacy systems  third party software applications and programming tools 
customers frequently use professional services from portal  third party system integrators or their own internal information technology organizations  or a combination thereof 
our ability to generate and increase or professional services revenues will depend in large part on the number of new license transactions and on our ability to gain a significant portion of the services associated with the implementation of infranet related projects 
we are not certain that our target customers will widely adopt and use our professional services 
in the future we may not be successful in marketing our services our failure to do so could harm our business 
the revenues we derive from our services business have a significantly lower margin than revenues derived from licensing infranet 
accordingly  the mix of license revenues and service revenues in any period will affect our operating margins for that period 
failure to meet analyst expectations for operating margins and profitability could cause a decrease in the market value of our common stock 
our quarterly revenue is generated from a limited number of customers and our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer a substantial portion of our license and services revenues in any given quarter has been  and is expected to continue to be  generated from a limited number of customers with large financial commitments 
for example  america online accounted for more than of our total revenues during each of the quarters of fiscal year as a result  if a large contract is cancelled or deferred or an anticipated contract does not materialize  our business would be harmed 
our total revenues could also be adversely affected if revenues from a significant customer in one period are not replaced with revenues from that customer or other customers in subsequent periods 
for example  america online is not anticipated to account for of our total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year as they have completed payment of the license fees for their initial order 
the communication and content industries we have targeted are consolidating  which could reduce the number of potential customers available to us 
in addition  several large telecommunications companies have announced decreases in their anticipated capital spending  which could have the effect of reducing future orders of our products 
moreover  many of our customers may have purchased sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy their current or anticipated requirements 
for all of these reasons our business could suffer in the future 
our inability to sublease surplus office space would increase our use of cash and operating expenses and adversely effect operating results we must periodically change our office facilities in various locations as the number of existing and projected employees changes for those locations or as existing leases expire 
securing and building out facilities takes significant lead time 
furthermore  because of the need to satisfy projected future expansion  the amount of space we have leased is generally more than the amount currently required 
significant office leases have terms of between and years 
as a result  we frequently sublease the portions of leased facilities that we have leased to meet our future expansion plans but do not currently need 
in addition  our reductions in our workforce undertaken over the past year have substantially reduced our facilities requirements in several locations 
as a result  we are attempting to sublease the facilities that we have previously leased but do not currently need 
portal has leased approximately  square feet and  square feet for its regional headquarters facilities in herndon  virginia and slough  united kingdom  respectively  for terms of ten and twenty years  respectively 
the amounts leased exceed our current requirements and we plan to sublease a majority of the facilities for a substantial portion  if not the entire balance  of the lease term 
moreover  we also plan to sublease a facility in cupertino that portal vacated earlier this year and that comprises approximately  square feet and is leased through december there is currently a large amount of vacant commercial real estate in the san francisco bay area 
moreover  currently prevailing rental rates in many locations are lower than those which we are obligated to pay under the leases 
we may therefore encounter significant difficulties or delays in subleasing such surplus space and may not be able to sublease it for rents equal to those which we are obligated to pay 
to the extent that we are unable to sublease this and other surplus space at an amount equal to our rent obligations for that space or to the extent sublessees fail to perform their obligations to pay rent  we could incur greater operating expenses than we initially planned or included within accrued restructuring charges 
such increases in operating expenses in a period could cause us to exceed our planned expense levels and adversely affect our financial results for that period 
furthermore  inability to sublease such space may adversely affect our planned uses of cash and our capital resources 
moreover  we have reduced the amount of the facilities restructuring charges we accrued in fiscal year by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas we have vacant space 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly  thus causing our accrual to be inaccurate 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges as related to the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to successfully plan and manage changes in the size of our operations our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have experienced rapid changes in our number of employees in recent years 
on march   we had employees compared to  employees on april  and employees on january  these changes have placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management resources our ability to train and allocate sufficient personnel resources to achieve our many objectives 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our worldwide work force 
we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations 
we must hire and retain qualified sales personnel to sell our products our financial success and our ability to increase revenues in the future depend considerably upon the productivity of our direct sales force that has historically generated a majority of our license revenues 
this productivity will depend to a large degree on our success in recruiting  training and retaining qualified direct salespeople 
there is strong competition for direct sales personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to sell our products 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired salespeople fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than we anticipate 
we also use systems integrators and other strategic relationships to implement and sell infranet we have entered into relationships with third party systems integrators  as well as with hardware platform and software applications developers and service providers 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our market opportunities and revenues from these relationships 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties or fail to grow our base of market and platform partners 
we may also be at a serious competitive disadvantage if we fail to maintain and enhance these indirect sales channels 
many of these partners also work with competing software companies and our success will depend on their willingness and ability to devote sufficient resources and efforts to marketing and resale of our products versus the products of others 
we may not be able to enter into additional  or maintain our existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our agreements with these parties typically are in the form of nonexclusive referral fee or reseller agreements that are effective for a limited period of time and may be renewed only by mutual agreement of both parties 
therefore  there is no guarantee that any single party will continue to market our products 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution  sales and marketing  implementation and support of our products than we would otherwise which would substantially increase our costs  and our efforts may not be as effective as those of our partners  either of which would harm our business 
our significant international operations make us much more susceptible to risks from international operations for the years ended january   and  we derived approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  from sales outside north america 
as a result  we face risks from doing business on an international basis  including  among others reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the united states dollar and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer sales and payment cycles  political and economic instability  seasonal reductions in business activity  potentially adverse tax consequences  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and variance and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations 
we currently have offices in a number of foreign locations including australia  canada  china  france  germany  italy  japan  malaysia  mexico  poland  singapore  spain  south korea  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom and may establish additional facilities in other parts of the world 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
in addition  we have sold infranet internationally for only a few years and we have limited experience in developing localized versions of infranet and marketing and distributing them internationally 
to date we have typically denominated nearly all of our international license revenues in us dollars 
therefore  a strengthening of the dollar versus other currencies could make our products less competitive in foreign markets or collection of receivables more difficult 
because our foreign denominated revenues have been minimal  we have not engage in currency hedging activities 
commencing in fiscal year  we plan to denominate a larger number of international transactions in euros and certain other currencies see also impact of foreign currency rate changes in item below 
in such event  we will face greater exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we may hedge our exposure on certain transactional balances that are denominated in foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
failure to effectively hedge foreign currency fluctuations would adversely affect our financial results 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage our international business due to any of the foregoing factors  our business could be adversely affected 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of infringement our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology or to develop products with the same functionality as our products 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
moreover  as the number of competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps  we expect that our software products may in the future become subject to third party infringement claims 
some of our competitors in the market for customer management and billing software may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology upon which they may claim our technology infringes 
any litigation  brought by us or by others  could be time consuming and costly and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and could have a material and adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
if a successful claim of product infringement were made against us  our business could be significantly harmed 
our business will suffer if our software contains significant errors or our product development is delayed we face possible claims and higher costs as a result of the complexity of our products and the potential for undetected errors 
due to the mission critical nature of infranet  undetected errors are of particular concern 
complex software  such as ours  always contains undetected errors 
the implementation of infranet  which we accomplish through our services division and with our partners  typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with an implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner  we could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project and to provide these services at reduced or no cost 
if our software contains significant undetected errors or we fail to meet our customers expectations or project milestones in a timely manner we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and implementation resources  injury to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us  and increased insurance costs 
our licenses with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
in addition  our license agreements generally cap the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the licensee to us for the product or service giving rise to the damages 
however  these contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable  in certain jurisdictions and under certain circumstances  and we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers internal systems 
a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs  damaging our reputation and distracting our management 
if we fail to release products on time  our business will suffer 
in the past we have failed to release certain new products and upgrades on time 
these delays may result in customer dissatisfaction  cancellation of orders and license agreements  negative publicity  loss of revenues  slower market acceptance  or legal action by customers against us 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to develop  license or acquire new products or enhancements to infranet on a timely and cost effective basis  or if these products or enhancements are not accepted by the market 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into infranet and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our business in the short term portions of infranet incorporate software developed and maintained by third party software vendors  such as operating systems  tools and database vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors and developers to a larger degree in our future products 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products or future products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
the absence of  or any significant delay in  the replacement of that functionality could result in delayed or lost sales and increased costs and could harm our business in the short term 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage technological change the market for our products and the services they are used to support is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
future versions of hardware and software platforms embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products obsolete 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
infranet is designed to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by our customers 
however  infranet may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments  accounting and other systems that our customers use 
we must constantly modify and improve our products to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to back office applications and other systems 
this may result in uncertainty relating to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications  which may harm our business 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete  which would harm our business 
the markets in which we sell our product are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we face competition from providers of customer management and billing software  such as amdocs ltd  convergys corporation which has acquired geneva technology ltd  csg systems international  inc and adc telecommunications inc we also compete with systems integrators and with internal information technology departments of larger communications providers 
many of our current and future competitors have significantly more personnel and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
we are aware of other companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with us 
furthermore  in recent years a number of our competitors have been acquired by companies larger than us who have sought to expand their cm b solutions capabilities 
the failure of portal to develop and market products and services that compete successfully with those of other suppliers in the market would harm our business 
portal anticipates that the market for its products and services will remain intensely competitive 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
also  current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they can use to compete more effectively 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of communication and content services we sell our products to organizations providing new and emerging communications and content services provided over a variety of communication networks including internet  fixed line  wireless and satellite networks 
consequently  our future revenues and profits  if any  substantially depend upon the market acceptance and expanded use of services provided through the internet and other communication methods 
rapid growth in the use of these services is a recent phenomenon and it may not continue 
as a result  a broad base of regular users of such services may not develop and the market may not accept recently introduced services and products that rely upon the adoption of such services  such as infranet 
many of the companies that are marketing broadband access to the internet or are offering new services over the internet  wireless networks and other communication mediums are relatively new businesses 
in the past two years  many so called dot 
com companies have failed and financing for emerging internet businesses has been increasingly more difficult to obtain 
we believe that the decline experienced in our north american operations since the third quarter of fiscal year is attributable in part to the difficulty experienced by several potential customers in receiving financing and a consequential impact on their decisions to make investments in customer management and billing products and services 
moreover  the market value  financial results and prospects of many large and established companies  including many large telecommunications companies  have also declined or degraded significantly 
emerging growth and established communications companies recently have been reducing or deferring their purchases of software and related products and the introduction of many new communication services has been delayed or cancelled 
this trend in technology and software spending has hurt and will continue to seriously harm our business until conditions improve 
any general decrease by our customers and potential customers in their rate of software and network investments would result in a significant decrease in our revenues and operating income 
to the extent that our customers and potential customers fail to achieve sustained profitability or obtain adequate funding  we could experience greater risk and difficulty collecting receivables from those customers that do purchase our products and services which would in turn harm our business and financial results 
future regulation of the internet or next generation communication services may slow their growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business it is possible that state and federal regulators could adopt laws and regulations that may impose additional burdens on those companies providing communications and content services 
the growth and development of new services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or for imposition of additional taxes 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations affecting communication services may slow their adoption or impose additional burdens on those companies providing such services 
a decline in the growth of next generation communication services could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise harm our business 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel despite overall reductions in our total headcount  we will continue to hire sales  support  marketing  administrative and research and development personnel in fiscal year and beyond 
competition for these individuals is intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
our business cannot succeed if we cannot attract qualified personnel 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing and support personnel in general 
acquisitions of additional companies or technologies may result in further disruptions to our business and management due to difficulties in assimilating personnel and operations we may make additional acquisitions or investments in other companies  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
financial difficulties of companies we have invested in could adversely affect our financial results we have made investments in three companies and may make investments in others in the future 
if at any time our investment in a company were deemed impaired  we may be required to reduce the book value of that investment  which would in turn reduce our earnings in that period 
such investments could be deemed impaired  for example  if the financial condition of those companies deteriorates 
as of january  and  respectively  we had approximately million total investment of million net of a valuation allowance of million and million invested in other companies 
during fiscal  we recorded a write down of million related to other than temporary impairment of these investments 
because the financial condition of these companies is outside our control  we cannot predict if  or when  the value of such investments would be required to be reduced 
the price of our common stock has been and will be volatile the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example the price of our common stock through january  has fluctuated between and per share 
future fluctuation could be a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
some of these factors include quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  failure to meet the expectations of industry analysts  changes in earnings estimates by us or by analysts  general conditions in the communications and content service industries  announcements and technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  increased price competition  and developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many internet and computer software companies  including ours  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies or our company 
decreases in the trading prices of stocks of technology companies are often precipitous 
for example  the price of our stock dropped rapidly and significantly during the first quarter of fiscal year  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and during the first quarter of fiscal year unpredictable foreign payroll taxes may cause our operating results to fluctuate in future periods causing us to fail to meet expectations we are generally subject to employer payroll taxes when our employees exercise their stock options 
the employer payroll taxes are assessed on each employee s gain  which is the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material 
these employer payroll taxes are recorded as an expense and are assessed at tax rates that vary depending upon the employee s taxing jurisdiction in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees 
however  because we are unable to predict how many stock options will be exercised  at what price and in which country during any particular period  we cannot predict  the amount  if any  of employer payroll expense that will be recorded in a future period or the impact on our future financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about portal s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for the reasons described under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks associated with portal s business and future operating results 
short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments rated the equivalent of standard poor s and moody s short term rating a p or long term rating of at least a a this policy dictates that we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments to a maximum of million to any one issuer 
our policy also dictates that all short term investments mature in months or less 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk and the weighted average interest rates  by year of expected maturity for portals investment portfolios as of january  this table does not include cash because cash is not subject to market risk 
it also does not include long term investments as they are held to maturity and  therefore  near term changes in market rates will not result in losses 
in thousands  except weighted average yields maturing within year maturing within years thereafter total as of january  cash equivalents weighted average yield investments weighted average yield total portfolio weighted average yield impact of foreign currency rate changes during fiscal year  most local currencies of our international subsidiaries weakened against the us dollar 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk has been insignificant primarily due to the denomination of nearly all of our sales transactions in us dollars 
for the fiscal year ended january   there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
to date  we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging 
as a global concern  we anticipate that our sales outside the united states will increasingly be denominated in other currencies 
in such event  we will face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations
