item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the following discussion  fiscal   and refer to the year ended march    and  respectively 
overview california micro devices corporation designs  develops and markets application specific integrated passive devices and complementary analog semiconductors 
our products provide signal integrity  electromagnetic interference filtering  electrostatic discharge protection  and power management solutions to original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
through proprietary manufacturing processes  we integrate multiple passive components onto single chips and enhance their functionality with discrete semiconductor functions 
our products are marketed primarily to customers in the mobile electronics  computing  led lighting  medical and other industries 
in the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved and we began to implement a program to streamline our manufacturing operations and focus our business on high volume products and in markets that we have  or believe we can achieve  a leadership position while leveraging our core technology strengths 
key parts of this strategy include the plan to outsource a significant portion of our wafer manufacturing to independent foundries and to discontinue certain older products 
in connection with outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer manufacturing  we are consolidating all of our internal wafer fabrication activities into our tempe  az facility with selected high value backend manufacturing activities continuing at our milpitas  ca headquarters 
in connection with these actions we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in the year ended march   which is reflected in operating expenses as special charges 
the restructuring program includes a workforce reduction and lease termination costs 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million compared to net sales for fiscal of million  a decrease of million  or 
the largest component of this decrease was in the communications infrastructure market followed by lower sales in the computer market 
net sales in the communications infrastructure market and computer market decreased to million and million  respectively  in fiscal from approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal also contributing to this decrease was our foundry business  in which net sales decreased from million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal these declines were partially offset by higher net sales in the mobile and other markets 
net sales from the mobile market almost trebled year over year  with net sales of approximately million in fiscal to net sales of approximately million in fiscal net sales from the medical market increased approximately million or from fiscal to fiscal also net sales into a lighting application increased million from fiscal to fiscal units shipped during fiscal decreased approximately million units to million units in fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were million as compared to revenues in fiscal of million  an increase of million  or 
the majority of this increase was in the computer and communication infrastructure markets 
units shipped increased in fiscal compared to the year earlier period 
gross margin 
gross margin is comprised of net sales less costs of sales 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  was a negative in fiscal compared to a positive in fiscal and a positive in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was in part the result of decreased manufacturing efficiencies on lower production volumes as sales decreased and also the result charges related to our revised manufacturing strategy 
fiscal gross margin includes charges of million relating to the write off of discontinued inventory on hand and at distributors in connection with our decision to outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing 
as a result of our decision to outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activity  our capacity at our tempe  az facility will not be fully utilized 
the costs related to this idle capacity are expensed as incurred 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  for fiscal was only slightly lower than gross margin for fiscal and was primarily due to the slight increase in the write off of certain excess inventory quantities in fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees  prototypes  masks  and other expenses for the development of process technology  new packages and products 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal and fiscal the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal is primarily the result of costs associated with the start up and operation of a new design center in austin  texas  including rent expense for the new center 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees  sales commissions  marketing and promotional expenses  and legal and other professional fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal is the result of higher legal and professional fees  almost entirely offset by lower compensation and sales commissions on lower revenues 
the increase from fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to increased commissions  increased personnel costs including the expansion of our presence in europe and the far east  and increased promotional activities 
special charges 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring and other special charges of million related to our decision to outsource a significant portion of our wafer manufacturing 
in connection with this decision  we will consolidate all of our internal wafer fabrication activities into our tempe  az facility  with selected high value backend manufacturing activities continuing at our milpitas  ca headquarters 
the million of special charges consists of expenses related to a workforce reduction  write down of certain manufacturing equipment and lease termination costs 
a summary of the charges is as follows total charge non cash charges cash payments restructuring liability at march  in thousands workforce reduction impairment of equipment facilities and other workforce reduction in connection with the restructuring program  we will reduce our headcount by approximately employees  primarily in the manufacturing functions and primarily located at our milpitas  ca facility 
approximately employees had been terminated as of march   with their severance and benefits paid in april  and we expect that the majority of the remaining employees will be terminated by the end of the second quarter of fiscal impairment of equipment as part of our restructuring program  we will outsource a significant portion of our wafer fabrication activities and consolidate most of our internal wafer fabrication activities into our tempe  az facility with selected high value backend manufacturing activities continuing at our milpitas  ca headquarters 
with the outsourcing of a significant portion of our wafer fabrication activities  the number and volume of products generated from the equipment located at our tempe facility will be significantly reduced 
as a result of these circumstances  we performed an analysis to determine if the manufacturing equipment at our tempe  az facility was impaired 
based on the analysis performed  which was based on our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  we determined that these assets were impaired and wrote down the value of the assets to their estimated fair value  resulting in a charge of million 
fair value was estimated as the amount for which the assets could be purchased in an arms length transaction 
facilities and other the restructuring plan calls for us to relocate from our milpitas facility once all internal wafer fabrication activities have been consolidated into our tempe  az facility 
as required by the lease for the milpitas facility  we are obligated to restore the milpitas facility to its pre lease condition 
accordingly  we recorded  in estimated renovation costs related to the milpitas facility 
we expect that the remaining cash expenditures relating to the workforce reduction will be paid in the second and third quarters of fiscal we expect to complete the implementation of this restructuring program during the next six months  with the remaining cash expenditures relating to facilities and other expected to be paid no later than the end of the second quarter of fiscal the restructuring liability is included in accrued liabilities in the balance sheet 
interest expense 
interest expense was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to is primarily due to the expiration of capital leases in fiscal  decreasing interest expense 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects financing of a portion of our capital expenditures during fiscal  which were at a higher level of expenditure than in fiscal interest income and other income expense  net 
interest income and other income expense  net was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal is primarily the result of lower interest income on lower average investment balances  offset in part by lower other expenses in fiscal  as fiscal included a  charge related to the write off of costs associated with a cancelled public offering of our common stock 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a  write off of costs associated with a cancelled public offering of our common stock 
income taxes 
in fiscal  there was no provision for income taxes due to the net loss incurred for the period 
in fiscal  we recorded a federal and state alternative minimum tax provision of  after taking into consideration the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
we did not incur income tax expense in fiscal due to the availability of tax loss carryforwards 
as of march   we had federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we have provided a valuation allowance against total deferred tax assets due to the uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits of the carryforwards 
see note of notes to financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations apb and amends or supersedes a number of interpretations of apb sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for by a single method the purchase method  all intangible assets acquired in a business combination are to be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they meet one of two criteria the contractual legal criterion or the separability criterion and in addition to the disclosure requirements in apb  disclosure of the primary reasons for a business combination and the allocation of the purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption 
when the amounts of goodwill and intangible assets acquired are significant in relation to the purchase price paid  disclosure of other information about those assets is required  such as the amount of goodwill by reportable segment and the amount of the purchase price assigned to each major intangible asset class 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june  in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we have not recorded any goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets prior to march  and accordingly  the adoption of this statement as of april  will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas provides accounting and reporting standards for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired and resolves significant implementation issues that existed with sfas we do not expect that adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue and or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and they have reviewed the disclosures of such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
the aspects of our revenue recognition policy that involve more significant judgments and estimates include the following collection is reasonably assured we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not probable  we defer recognition of revenue until the collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
deferred gross margin shipments to distributors with rights of return are deferred until the inventory is sold through to the end user 
at the time of shipment of product to distributors where there is the right of return  we record the standard margin in deferred margin on sales to distributors  a component of current liabilities on our balance sheet 
deferred margin represents our estimate of the standard margin on the sale to distributors 
at march   deferred margin on sales to distributors was million 
inventory and related reserves our inventory and related reserves policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
the aspects of our inventory and related reserves policy that involve more significant judgments and estimates include the following forecast of customer demand we provide reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on a comparison of quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand for the next months 
in forecasting customer demand  we make estimates as to  among other things  the timing of sales  the mix of products sold to customers  the timing of design wins and related volume purchases by new and existing customers  and the timing of existing customers transition to new products 
because a significant portion of our sales are through distributors and many parts may have small sales volume  the customer demand forecast process is not inclusive of all parts 
therefore  historical trends may also be used in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we review our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis considering all known facts and circumstances and adjust our forecast of customer demand accordingly 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
in fiscal  we recognized a benefit of approximately  relating to the sale or consumption of inventory that had been previously reserved 
to the extent that our forecast of customer demand materially differs from actual demand  our estimates used in determining cost of sales and gross margin could be positively or negatively impacted 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss will be measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
in fiscal  we determined that the carrying value of certain of our owned manufacturing equipment was no longer recoverable based on estimates of future cash flows 
our estimate of the future cash flows generated from this equipment decreased significantly in due to the completion of our plan to outsource a significant portion of our wafer fabrication activities to an independent foundry 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million in the second quarter of this equipment has a post impairment carrying value of approximately million and we anticipate it will continue to be used for the foreseeable future 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset for recoverability were based on current operating projections extended to the useful life of the asset group 
we have estimated the fair value of the equipment based on an outside appraisal that relied on market prices for purchases of similar equipment 
if the estimate of the cash flows were to decrease or increase by the assets would still not be recoverable 
litigation we are a party to lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including commercial and employment matters  which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
we review the current status of any pending or threatened proceedings with our outside counsel on a regular basis and  considering all the other known relevant facts and circumstances  recognize any loss that we consider probable and estimable as of the balance sheet date 
because of the potentially significant impact that any possible unfavorable outcome relating to any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  we consider this a critical accounting estimate 
during fiscal  and  we did not recognize a liability in our balance sheet for any pending threatened litigation  claims  or proceedings 
we have two cases pending in the santa clara county  state of california superior court in which the amount sought by the plaintiffs is several millions of dollars  and therefore a verdict in their favor would be materially adverse to our business 
although several years old  both cases have been stayed by courts until fairly recently  and as a result  both cases are early in the discovery phase  making it difficult to assess the probability of the opposing parties or ourselves prevailing with a significant degree of confidence 
the first case involves counterclaims brought by our former ceo  chan desaigoudar  after we sued him for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty 
the counterclaims are for  among other items  wrongful termination and improper termination of his stock option 
the second case involves a former employee  tarsaim l 
batra  who has sued the company and three of our former officers  mr 
desaigoudar  steve hencke and surendra gupta  likewise for wrongful termination of his employment and for deprivation of his stock options 
the us government in the past has prosecuted messrs 
desaigoudar  hencke  and gupta for criminal securities law violations 
mr 
gupta plead guilty before trial while messrs 
desaigoudar and hencke were convicted  however  their convictions were overturned and a retrial was imminent when last month they each entered a guilty plea as to one or more of the counts and are awaiting sentencing 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims of the opposing parties in both of these cases 
currently  we intend to vigorously pursue our defenses and or our claims against the opposing parties in these matters 
should we unexpectedly learn facts during discovery which lead us to reasonably estimate a negative outcome to these cases  or should one or both of these cases result in a verdict for the other parties  then we would provide for such liability as appropriate 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through a combination of debt and equity financing and cash generated from operations 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of march  was million  as compared to million at march  receivables decreased to million at march  compared to million a year earlier  primarily as a result of lower sales 
receivables days sales outstanding were days at march  as compared to days as of march  inventories decreased from million at march  to million at march   in part due to the write off of discontinued inventory of million and to decreased production volumes in response to decreased sales activity 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal reflecting our continued investment in new equipment to support our production of chipscale products 
operating activities used million of cash in fiscal the most significant usage of cash was our net loss before non cash charges of million 
increases in long term assets and decreases in other long term liabilities used an additional  of cash 
these uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets and increases in accounts payable and deferred margin on distributor sales  which provided million of cash for operations 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to net income of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  which were partially offset by an increase in inventories and decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of million 
cash used by operating activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of million which was more than offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  we generated cash of million from investing activities for fiscal as compared to using cash of million in fiscal and  in fiscal cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was the result of net proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million  partially offset by cash used to purchase capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million and was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our common stock of million 
in fiscal  we sold  shares of our common stock to several institutional investors and certain of our directors for gross proceeds of million  offset by cash offering expenses of  in addition  we received million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans and  from long term borrowings 
repayments of capital lease obligations and long term debt of million  partially offset these proceeds 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was the result of borrowings of long term debt and proceeds from the sale of our common stock of million  offset by repayments on long term debt and capital lease obligations of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million and resulted from proceeds from the sale of our common stock of million  partially offset by repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement which allows us to borrow up to a total of million under an equipment line of credit and a revolving line of credit  each of which cannot individually exceed million 
the amount available under the agreement is based on the amount of eligible equipment and accounts receivable 
under this agreement  which includes a subjective acceleration clause  we are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions and must maintain a compensating balance of million in order to retain the availability of the revolving credit line 
borrowings under the equipment line and the revolving line bear interest at an annual rate of prime plus and prime plus  respectively 
principal  in equal installments  and interest are due monthly for a term of months for all borrowings made under the equipment line 
borrowings under the revolving credit line have a term of months  with principal due at maturity and interest due in monthly installments 
borrowings under both lines are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
during fiscal  we entered into two capital equipment financing facilities aggregating million 
the terms of these facilities allowed us to borrow at prime plus 
during fiscal and  we borrowed the full amounts available under these facilities 
at march   no additional funds were available under these two facilities 
at march    was due under these facilities 
we expect to terminate these facilities and pay off this debt in full with the proceeds to be received under the loan and security agreement described above 
in july  we secured an additional million equipment financing facility with interest at prime plus 
during fiscal we borrowed  against this million facility 
at march    was due under this facility 
we expect to terminate this facility and pay off this debt in full with the proceeds to be received under the loan and security agreement described above 
in fiscal  we entered into a credit agreement allowing us to borrow up to  at an annual interest rate of prime plus  collateralized by our equipment and other assets 
in fiscal  we borrowed  against this agreement 
at march    was due under this facility 
we expect to terminate this facility and pay off this debt in full with the proceeds to be received under the loan and security agreement described above 
as of march   we were not in compliance with our financial covenants related to approximately million of our outstanding borrowings 
accordingly  the entire balance is classified as current liabilities in our balance sheet at march  we plan to pay off this debt in full with the proceeds received under the loan and security agreement described above 
additionally  as of march   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants related to our industrial revenue bonds 
in accordance with the terms of the industrial revenue bonds  our non compliance would need to continue for at least four consecutive quarters in order for the industrial revenue bonds to become callable 
we believe that we will be in compliance prior to the end of that period and accordingly  there is no impact on our short term liquidity due to our non compliance 
future maturities of long term debt and sinking fund requirements at march  are million in fiscal  million in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and million thereafter 
we lease certain of our manufacturing facilities and sales offices under non cancelable operating leases  expiring from fiscal to fiscal future minimum lease payments under these leases are  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal in may  we entered into a new facility lease for office and light manufacturing space in milpitas  ca 
total future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease are million 
operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we maintain revenue  margins  inventory  accounts receivable and operating expenses 
in fiscal  we began to implement a restructuring program aimed at streamlining our manufacturing operations  bringing our costs more in line with the current revenue levels and restoring profitability 
if we were not to adjust our operations and instead use the same amount of cash in our business operations in fiscal as we did in fiscal  we would run out of cash 
our operating plan for fiscal forecasts revenue growth and profit improvement  due in part to our focused sales and marketing efforts and in part to gross margin improvement and expense reductions resulting from our manufacturing outsourcing 
should we achieve that plan  we will require additional equipment financing which we may not be able to obtain on terms we consider reasonable and we may wish to raise additional equity capital to provide us with cash reserves and to fund future growth 
if we do not achieve the operating plan  we will need to further adjust our operations in order to conserve our cash  which will be used to fund operating losses instead of growth 
in such event  we may also need to raise additional equity capital  although such funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
regardless of whether we achieve our operating plan  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are not sufficient to support our activities  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing in order to sustain our operations at the level we desire 
the funds may not be available to us  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our cash until it is required to fund operations and capital investments 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes except for amounts related to our non qualified deferred compensation program 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to fluctuation in interest rates 
our investment portfolio includes debt instruments that are primarily united stated treasury and municipal bonds  high grade corporate bonds  and money market funds of less than one year in duration 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
our investment portfolio also consists of certain commercial paper that is also subject to interest rate risk 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
the interest rates on nearly all of our long term debt are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate fluctuations
