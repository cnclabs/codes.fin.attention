these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report  and the company disclaims any obligation to update such forward looking statements as a result of any change in circumstances or otherwise overview mro software is a leading global provider of strategic asset management solutions 
strategic asset management is the management and optimization of assets that have a significant impact on customer operations and performance  including assets used in a company s production  facilities  fleet and information technology it operations 
the company s integrated suite of software applications optimizes performance  improves productivity and service levels and enables asset centric procurement 
our strategic asset management solutions include maximo for the enterprise asset management eam market  maximo maincontrol for the it asset management itam market and our online commerce services ocs that enable asset centric procurement capabilities 
during fiscal  the company operated in two reportable industry segments the development  marketing and support of demand side software products and services  consisting of maximo enterprise and maximo extended enterprise and the development  marketing and support of supply side software products and services  consisting of enterprise catalog management and ocs 
at the beginning of fiscal  the demand side product offerings were re named strategic mro  and the supply side product offerings were split into two distinct product groups enterprise catalog management and ocs 
as all of these products were complementary to one another  the company repositioned to one reportable industry segment 
in june  we acquired maincontrol  inc and its it asset management product  mc empower re branded maximo maincontrol 
during the course of the fiscal year  we also began incorporating portions of our e commerce technologies into maximo and we redefined our ocs and enterprise catalog management solution  creating an asset centric procurement solution that would complement our asset management solutions maximo and maximo maincontrol 
we offer a single integrated suite of complementary products and services that enable our customers to manage all of their critical capital assets throughout their respective lifecycles of planning  procurement  deployment  tracking  maintenance and retirement 
all segment reported financial information contained in this report has been restated to reflect the company s repositioning to one industry segment  effective in the first quarter of fiscal year the company s management assesses operating results on an aggregate basis to make decisions about the allocation of resources 
as a result  we have redefined our one reportable industry segment as strategic asset management 
certain prior year financial statement items have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial conditions and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  page liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  in which different judgments and estimates by our management could materially affect our reported condition and results of operations  include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  and the valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition the company licenses its software products under noncancellable license agreements 
software license fee revenues are generally recognized upon contract execution and shipment  provided collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable  the fees are fixed or determinable  and no significant modification or customization of the software is required 
services revenues are comprised of consulting and training fees related to installation of the company s software solutions  maintenance support pcs contracts for software solutions  content management and cataloging services  annual commerce and transaction fees  and subscription based fees related to the company s online commerce services ocs business 
consulting  training  content management and cataloging services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
pcs revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  generally one year 
customers typically subscribe to ocs on an annual basis and revenue is recorded as services revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the applicable subscription period 
the company s multi element arrangements could include the following three elements a software license  b pcs  and c consulting  training and other services services 
revenue is allocated to the elements of the arrangement based upon the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of each element 
the company uses the residual method to recognize its software license revenue  because while we are able to determine the vsoe of fair value of pcs and services  we are unable to determine the vsoe of the fair value of software licenses 
under the residual method  the fair value of undelivered elements pcs and or services is deferred and recognized when the pcs and or services are delivered 
the difference between the amount of the total arrangement and the amount attributable to the undelivered elements pcs and or services is recognized as software license revenue 
vsoe is established for pcs and is based on the price of pcs when sold separately 
the pcs renewal rate is a relatively consistent percentage of the stipulated software license fee  offered to all customers 
vsoe for consulting services is based on fixed hourly rates set according to the skill level of the consultant required 
vsoe for training services is based on an established per student fee structure 
for those multi element arrangements  where we cannot establish vsoe for the undelivered elements  the software license value is recognized together with the consulting services over the period the consulting services are provided 
contract accounting is applied to any arrangement that includes significant customization or modification of the software 
revenue for services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is significant uncertainty about receipt of payment  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
in situations that involve disputes  any conceded amounts are written off against revenue in the period that the dispute is resolved 
our customers do not have any right of return except as stipulated under a standard day warranty that runs concurrent with pcs 
the company does not maintain any reserves with respect to this warranty based on a history of high performance of our software 
on the rare occasion that a customer insists on conditions of acceptance  the company defers revenue until the customer s acceptance is obtained and the condition has been satisfied 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net days 
payment terms that extend beyond net days from the contract date but are within twelve months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful history of collecting on such types of arrangements 
total accounts receivable with extended payment terms were million as of september  for those customers who are deemed not to be credit worthy  revenue is deferred until payment is received 
revenue from products sold through indirect channels resellers is recognized upon shipment of the software  as long as evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility is probable and the fee is fixed or determinable 
revenue is page recorded net of any commissions or discounts 
our resellers do not have any right of return beyond the standard day performance warranty that runs concurrent with pcs 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts  which reflects the company s estimate of the amounts owed by customers that customers will be unable or otherwise fail to pay 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and limits the amount of credit when deemed necessary 
the company believes that the current estimate of allowances for doubtful accounts recorded as of september   adequately covers any potential credit risks 
however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates and their payment defaults exceed our estimates  then we may need to increase our allowance reserves  which will result in a charge to income in the period that the adjustment is made 
the company did not record a provision for estimated sales returns 
based on our history of sales returns and an analysis of credit memos  we determined that a provision was not needed 
if the historical data we used to calculate the basis for a provision does not properly reflect future returns  then a provision for returns will be recorded in the period that such a determination is made 
deferred income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting for income taxes in accordance with fas the company computes deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes 
the company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax asset 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future expected tax benefit when it is more likely than not to be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
negative evidence that would suggest the need for a valuation allowance for the company consists of our recent cumulative operating losses 
however  since these operating losses are attributable to several charges that we believe are non recurring in nature  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance in relation to these losses 
the non recurring charges contributing to the company s recent cumulative operating losses consist of goodwill amortization from recent acquisitions and a large initial investment into the internet e commerce market 
positive evidence that would negate the need for a valuation allowance consists of the projection of future pre tax profits and a strong earnings history for the company prior to these operating loss years 
the company believes future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
in the event that it is determined that we cannot realize the net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets will be made and will result in a charge to income in the period such a determination is made 
the net deferred tax asset amount recorded as of september  is million 
the company has established a valuation allowance with respect to certain canadian net operating loss carryforwards  the net operating losses acquired from applied image technologies  inc ait  and various state net operating loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance was based upon expected earnings within individual tax jurisdictions and statutory limitations imposed by tax jurisdictions  which will more likely than not reduce our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards 
these valuation allowances are thousand  million and thousand  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company periodically reviews its long lived assets  including intangible assets resulting from acquisitions  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair value 
the company estimates whether future cash flows expected to result from the use of assets exceed the carrying amount of the assets 
in the page event that the company judges that an impairment exists  all or a portion of the asset will be written off based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in order to determine the fair value  the company obtains quoted market prices or utilizes valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the company s products and businesses are operated as a single product suite and do not maintain separate cash flows or operating margins 
as of september   all remaining goodwill has been assigned to one reporting unit and will be reviewed for impairment at the entity level 
the company also periodically assesses the useful life of its fixed assets and intangibles and may in the future need to adjust the life of an asset and write it off 
acquisitions on june   the company completed the acquisition of maincontrol  inc maincontrol  a provider of it asset management solutions 
the purpose of the acquisition was to expand the company s product base and enable us to offer products that manage a broader range of an enterprise s strategic assets 
the company reports the revenues of it asset management with its strategic mro product offering and has re named this combined product offering strategic asset management 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company acquired all outstanding equity of maincontrol for a combination of mro common stock and cash 
the company paid million in cash and issued  shares valued at per share 
the share price was calculated by averaging the closing price of a share of mro software s stock for five days before and five days after the announcement date of the merger  as reported by the nasdaq national market 
the total purchase price  including transaction expenses of thousand  was million 
an additional amount of thousand is payable contingent upon reaching certain revenue thresholds through december  thousand of the contingent amount has been paid and recorded as goodwill at september  if the remaining thousand of contingent payments are made  the company will account for the payments as additional purchase price and will allocate it to goodwill 
the company allocated the purchase price as such million to current and other assets  million to acquired technology  million to customer contracts  thousand to backlog  thousand to software documentation  thousand to a non compete agreement  million to goodwill  and million to current liabilities 
the purchase price allocation was based on then current intentions for future use of the acquired assets  estimate of future projected cash flows  analysis of historical financial results and review of customer contracts 
acquired technology will be amortized over six and one half years  customer contracts will be amortized over four years  backlog will be amortized over one year  software documentation will be amortized over three years and the non compete agreement will be amortized over two years 
page results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  revenues software support and services total revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administration amortization of goodwill and other intangibles total operating expenses loss from operations other income loss income before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss income page revenues the company s revenues are derived primarily from two sources i software licenses  and ii fees for support and services 
the company has organized its product offerings into three categories asset management products and services  enterprise catalog management products and services and online commerce services 
our asset management products consist of the maximo and maximo maincontrol software products and services

fiscal fiscal fiscal year year year ended change ended change ended in thousands software licenses    percentage of total revenues support and services    percentage of total of revenues total revenues    fiscal compared to fiscal software license revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was mainly attributable to a decrease in maximo software license revenues 
maximo software license revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in the company attributes this decrease to a continued slowdown in its customers it spending  slower than expected adoption of maximo  and overall adverse economic conditions 
the company recognized million of software license revenues related to its it asset management product maximo maincontrol that was acquired from maincontrol  inc in june enterprise catalog management software licenses increased to thousand in fiscal from thousand in fiscal the company has not yet realized any software license revenue from its collego catalog management product  which was acquired in august this product has been incorporated into ocs and has not been offered for sale as a stand alone product since july support revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively

service revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
maximo service revenues decreased to million from million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a decline in maximo software licenses sold  which reduced the demand for services related to customer implementations 
the company derives a large portion of its services revenues from the implementation of maximo software that has recently been sold to new customers  and our services revenues are therefore driven largely by our maximo license sales 
the company recognized thousand of service revenues related to its maximo maincontrol product that was acquired from maincontrol  inc in june enterprise catalog management service revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal enterprise catalog management services revenues consists of content normalization services  and the decrease in these revenues is due to a continued page decrease in demand for these services  and a stagnant e commerce market

ocs support and service revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a single large subscription contract for million  which is being recognized ratably over the month term of the contract

the company will maintain its investment in this solution commensurate with the level of sales  while simultaneously controlling operating and administrative expenses

change to asp model for ocs supply side products 
in fiscal  with the high end of the market for supply side on line commerce software saturated  the company began to target the low end of the market and transitioned to an asp subscription model for its supply side ocs products  which was more appropriate to the low end of the market 
the change to an asp model combined with the focus on a different supplier market affected the company s customer base and its revenues for fiscal as follows a the company s customer base was broadened from a smaller number of relatively large industrial suppliers purchasing perpetual licenses of supply side products at a high price point  to greater numbers of relatively small suppliers  purchasing annual subscriptions to these products at a low price point  and b we changed from recording revenues as upfront perpetual software licenses to recording revenues as services  ratably over the service period  which is generally one year 
the change to an asp model  combined with the change in focus to a new supplier market  resulted in a decrease of software revenues from our supply side ocs products 
in fiscal  the company recorded revenue of million from its sales of perpetual licenses of its supply side ocs products

this change in the target market segment and sales model accounts for million of the decline in supply side software license revenues

factors affecting future performance the nature of forward looking information is that such information involves significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
certain public documents of the company and statements made by our authorized officers  directors  employees  agents and representatives  acting on behalf of the company  may include forward looking information  which will be influenced by the factors described below  and by other assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
forward looking information is based on assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections regarding the company s future results as well as the future effectiveness of the company s strategic plans and future operational decisions 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company are subject to the risk that the forecasts  projections  and expectations of management  or assumptions underlying such forecasts  projections and expectations  may become inaccurate 
accordingly  actual results and the company s implementation of its plans and operations may differ materially from forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the following discussion identifies certain important factors that could affect the company s actual results and actions and could cause such results and actions to differ materially from forward looking statements 
our inability to keep pace with the rapid changes in technology that characterize our industry would damage our competitive position 
the computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements by us and by our competitors 
our success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our current products  and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  respond to evolving customer requirements and changing industry standards  and achieve market acceptance 
in particular  we believe that we must continue to respond quickly to users needs for new functionality and to advances in hardware and operating systems  and that we must continue to create products that conform to industry standards regarding the communication and interoperability among software  hardware and communications products of different vendors 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and changes in customer requirements  or if we have any significant delays in product development or introduction  then we could lose competitiveness and revenues 
we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements  or that we will not experience significant delays in our development efforts 
in addition  we cannot give any assurance that our new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
finally  when we develop new products or enhancements to our existing products  it is possible that potential customers will defer or delay their decisions to purchase existing products while the newer products and enhancements are being developed  released and proven in the market 
such delays page could have a material  adverse impact on ongoing sales of existing products  and on the company s business and our results of operations 
we depend substantially on our maximo r product  and any developments that caused reduced market acceptance of maximo would harm our business 
most of our revenues are derived from the licensing of our maximo family of products and sales of related services and support 
our financial performance depends largely on continued market acceptance of maximo  and on the acceptance and market penetration of maximo  the new internet centric version of maximo 
we believe that continued market acceptance of maximo  and our revenue stability and growth  will largely depend on our ability to continue to enhance and broaden the capabilities of maximo  both by broadening the core maximo functionality and developing specialized functionality targeted at key customer industries 
any factor adversely affecting sales of maximo  such as delays in further development  significant software flaws  incompatibility with significant hardware platforms  operating systems or databases  increased competition or negative evaluations of the product would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and our results of operations 
in addition  as with any new software product  it is possible that our customers will experience difficulties in implementing maximo and achieving the desired performance  either as a result of the inherent instability of new technology  or of a perceived shortfall in the functionality of a new product in comparison with the prior  more mature versions 
if our maximo customers have difficulties installing and using the software or if they are not satisfied with the performance or functionality of maximo  and if we were therefore unable to obtain customer references  our maximo sales would suffer  which would have an adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 
the market addressed by our maximo maincontrol product is in turmoil  and a significant new competitor may emerge 
our maximo maincontrol product is targeted at the it asset maintenance market 
in the past  peregrine systems  inc had the biggest single share of this market  peregrine recently filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result of peregrine s bankruptcy  some prospective maximo maincontrol customers have questioned the validity of the market  and some have adopted a wait and see attitude towards purchasing products in this market 
the ultimate disposition of peregrine s it asset related business may have a detrimental affect on the company s ability to market its maximo maincontrol product 
if peregrine successfully emerges from bankruptcy with streamlined operations and without the burden of its pre bankruptcy liabilities  the company may be faced with a stronger competitor 
during the bankruptcy process  peregrine may auction off its it asset related business  and the buyer could become a significant competitor of the company in this market 
this new competitor may have previously been a competitor of the company  or it may be a new entrant in the company s competitive landscape 
there is considerable uncertainty about the future of peregrine s it asset related business  and the prospects for the it asset maintenance market and the company s ability to market and sell maximo maincontrol may be affected by the outcome of peregrine s bankruptcy proceedings 
the company has included sales of maximo maincontrol in its projections and guidance for fiscal  and if the itam market or peregrine s bankruptcy has an adverse affect on maximo maincontrol sales  there could be an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our online commerce services offering may decline further 
our ocs business is dependent on the success and growth of the online business to business market in general  and ocs operations and revenues have declined as the market for business to business e commerce platforms and supporting solutions has experienced significant turmoil  general downturn  and demand for these solutions has been sharply reduced 
there is no clear indication of whether or when this market may re emerge  or the direction that it may take 
as a result  we cannot predict whether or when solutions that enable business to business e commerce  marketplaces or exchanges  such as ocs  will gain acceptance and be adopted on a repeated or predictable basis 
we are unlikely to see any growth in revenues from our ocs page solutions until the markets for business to business solutions in general  and for e commerce initiatives related to industrial products and services in particular  stabilize  move and grow in an understandable and predictable direction and our existing ocs revenues may be reduced further if these markets continue to decline 
our sales efforts rely on distributors  resellers  sales agents and other channel partners  and on companies with which we have strategic relationships  whose actions we cannot control 
as part of our efforts to maintain and grow our revenues  we must depend on our existing distribution channels  and we must also develop new channels 
we cannot control the actions of our distributors  resellers  agents and other channel partners  and if these companies suffer business downturns or fail to meet their objectives  our revenues and results of operations will suffer as a result 
we have entered into strategic relationships with various larger companies  such as ibm corporation  i technologies  inc  rockwell automation  at kearney  inc  and others 
in order to generate incremental revenue through these relationships  we must integrate our products and solutions with those of the other companies 
each party to those strategic relationships must coordinate with and support each other s sales and marketing efforts  and each party must make significant sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  we have agreed to develop a version of maximo  which will operate with ibm s websphere  aix and db products  and to market the ibm versions of our products in preference to other versions 
maximo sales will therefore be affected by the success and acceptance of the ibm websphere  aix and db products relative to those of ibm s competitors 
we may experience difficulties in gaining market acceptance of the ibm version of our products  and difficulties in integrating and coordinating our products and sales efforts with those of ibm 
finally  our alliance with ibm may be viewed negatively by customers or prospects that have not adopted the ibm technology platform  and competitive alliances may emerge among other companies that are more attractive to our customers and prospective customers 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and to seasonal variation 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results  which may negatively impact the price of our stock 
we believe that these quarterly fluctuations are partly attributable to our sales commission policies  which compensate members of our direct sales force for meeting or exceeding annual quotas  and therefore tend to influence our fourth and first quarter revenues 
in addition  our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated historically due to the number and timing of product introductions and enhancements  customers delaying their purchasing decisions in anticipation of new product releases  the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers  the timing of product shipments and the timing of marketing and product development expenditures 
we typically realize a significant portion of our revenue from sales of software licenses in the last two weeks of a quarter  frequently even in the last few days of a quarter 
failure to close a small number of large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we face challenges with the maincontrol acquisition  and we may not be successful in addressing a new and broader market 
we recently completed the acquisition of maincontrol  inc  which markets a product that enables companies to manage  track and maintain their information technology it assets  such as computers  telephones and networks 
one of the assumptions underlying our acquisition of maincontrol was that our existing customers might be interested in purchasing our new it product  however  in many cases the people who purchased maximo may not have responsibility for or authority covering the management of their company s it assets 
with the acquisition of maincontrol  our positioning with existing and prospective customers has changed  in that we are now offering products  which can manage more of a company s critical physical assets  such as its it assets  in addition to those managed by maximo  such as plant floor assets  vehicles and facilities 
if we are unable to obtain access to executive page levels in our customers and prospective customers organizations  we will be unable to sell a solution that covers more than just the plant floor assets  the vehicle fleet  the facilities or the it assets 
moreover  it is possible that our attempts to characterize this combination of target markets as a single or composite market will not be accepted within the industry  by market analysts or by our customers  and as a result we will not gain the cross market sales opportunities and synergies that we hoped for in the maincontrol acquisition 
products and technologies we acquire through acquisitions may fail to meet our expectations 
we may from time to time purchase software products or technologies from other companies  or as part of our acquisition of other companies  such as our acquisition of maincontrol 
while we exercise due diligence in determining whether acquired products or technologies are suitable and of commercial quality  there can be no assurances that the new products or technologies will ultimately meet our expectations  that we will be able to employ and retain the personnel necessary for us to effectively exploit the new products or technologies  that we will be able to successfully integrate the new products or technologies with or into our existing products and product architecture  that we will be able to effectively distribute the new products or technologies through our existing sales force and channels  that we will be able to retain existing customers and revenue streams that may have been associated with the new products or technologies prior to their acquisition by us  or that such existing customers may not demand that we remedy problems that were not known or disclosed at the time of the acquisition 
as a result of the foregoing  we may not realize the benefits intended from such acquisitions or recover its investments  which would have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 
we face intense competition in the markets we serve 
the market for strategic asset maintenance software such as maximo and maximo maincontrol is fragmented by geography  by hardware platform and by industry orientation  and is characterized by a large number of competitors including both independent software vendors and certain enterprise resource planning erp vendors 
independent software vendors include datastream systems  inc and indus international  inc maximo also competes with integrated erp systems  which include integrated maintenance modules offered by several large vendors  such as sap  oracle  jd edwards and others 
maximo maincontrol competes with companies in it asset management market  such as computer associates  inc and peregrine systems  inc currently  maximo competes with products of a number of large vendors  some of which have traditionally provided maintenance software running on mainframes and minicomputers and are now offering systems for use in the client server environment 
maximo also encounters competition from vendors of low cost maintenance management systems designed initially for use by a single user or limited number of users as vendors of these products upgrade their functionality to enter the client server market 
certain of our competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technological resources than we do 
to the extent that such competitors increase their focus on the asset maintenance or planning and cost systems markets  or on the industrial supply chain market  we could be at a competitive disadvantage 
our international operations subject us to special risks 
a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from operations outside the united states 
our ability to sell our products internationally is subject to a number of risks 
general economic and political conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
exposure to currency fluctuations and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable could affect our sales 
we could be affected by the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign import laws  united states export laws and regulatory requirements 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and increase our operating costs 
page our software products are dependent on third party providers of software and services  and failure of these parties to perform as expected  or termination of our relationships with them  could harm our business 
we have entered into nonexclusive license agreements with other software vendors  pursuant to which we incorporate into our products and solutions software providing certain application development  user interface  business intelligence  content and graphics capabilities developed by these companies 
we have also agreed to bundle ibm s websphere application server  its aix operating system and db database programs with maximo 
if we cannot renew these licenses at all or on commercially reasonable terms  or if any of such vendors were to become unable to support and enhance its products  we could be required to devote additional resources to the enhancement and support of these products or to acquire or develop software providing equivalent capabilities  which could cause delays in the development and introduction of products incorporating such capabilities 
our failure to successfully anticipate trends in internet technology and standards could prevent our products and services from achieving or maintaining market acceptance 
we recently released maximo  which is entirely based upon java and other technologies emerging and recently adopted in conjunction with the internet 
new internet technologies and applications are developing rapidly and are continuously being introduced  competing for acceptance in the market  and changing 
mro supply chain management using electronic commerce is an emerging market with many standards and technologies either competing for acceptance or remaining to be developed 
accordingly  for our maximo and ocs offerings to be successful  we must accurately predict and successfully implement those standards and technologies that ultimately gain long term acceptance in the market 
we believe that electronic commerce products and technologies complement our strategic asset management products 
we cannot give any assurance that we will successfully anticipate trends in this market  that we will be successful in internet technology development or acquisition efforts or that our internet applications  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
periodically  we are subject to income tax audits 
while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations or critical accounting policies could materially adversely affect us 
new laws  regulations or standards related to us or our products  and new accounting pronouncements  could be implemented or changed in a manner that could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may be forced to perform more fixed price services contracts 
a trend may be emerging among customers in our market towards offering consulting and implementation services on a fixed price basis  whereby the company agrees to deliver the contract requirements for a fixed fee  regardless of the actual number of person hours actually provided  as opposed to our traditional services arrangements where we deliver services on a time and materials basis 
in cases where services are provided on a fixed price basis and software is licensed at the same time  and if the services are essential to the overall solution desired by the customer or if the company cannot determine the fair value of the services being delivered  then the company may be required to recognize the license revenue from such transactions under the contract method of accounting 
page this would likely result in a postponement of recognition of  or even a reduction in  software license revenues  and could adversely affect our results of operation 
we may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property 
our success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we currently have one united states patent and one patent pending within the us and corresponding applications pending in various foreign countries  and we protect our technology primarily through copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements 
our software products are sometimes licensed to customers under shrink wrap or click wrap licenses included as part of the product packaging or acknowledged by customers who register on line 
although  in larger sales  our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses may be accompanied by specifically negotiated agreements signed by the licensee  in many cases our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees 
certain provisions of our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  including provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program  and limitations or liabilities and exclusions of remedies  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot give any assurance that the steps that we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or development by others of similar technology 
although we believe that our products and technology do not infringe on any valid claim of any patent or any other proprietary rights of others  we cannot give any assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  could result in the deterioration or outright loss of our patent rights  copyrights or other intellectual property  and could potentially have a material adverse result on our operating results and financial condition 
loss of the services of one or more of our key executive officers or inability to recruit needed sales  services and technical personnel could adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent on certain key executive officers  technical and sales employees  and the loss of one or more of such employees could have an adverse impact on our future operations 
we do not have employment contracts with any personnel  and we do not maintain any so called key person life insurance policies on any personnel 
we continue to hire a significant number of additional sales  services and technical personnel 
competition for hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and from time to time we may experience difficulty in locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications within the desired geographic locations  or with certain industry specific domain expertise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
our stock price has been volatile  and you could incur losses as a result of future fluctuations in our stock price 
there have recently been significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software and e commerce companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  general macro economic and market conditions unrelated to our performance may also affect demand for our products and services  our results of operations  and our stock price 
our business is sensitive to general economic conditions  and to overall downturns in the economy and in industrial spending 
the us and worldwide economies have recently experienced a recession or similar conditions  with a negative effect on our revenues and operations 
as industrial page companies experience downturns  they often delay or cease spending on capital assets and it infrastructure including software and related services 
as a result  our revenues have in the past fallen  and may again in the future fall  below expectations 
if the us and worldwide economies do not recover and if growth and it spending do not materialize  our revenues may be decreased  and there could be a material adverse result on our operating results and financial condition 
other risks the foregoing is not a complete description of all risks relevant to our future performance  and the foregoing should be read and understood together with and in the context of similar discussions which may be contained in the documents that we file with the sec in the future 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revision to the foregoing or any update to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on its cash equivalents and marketable securities and exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at september   the company held million in cash equivalents and marketable securities consisting of taxable and tax exempt municipal securities 
cash equivalents are classified as available for sale and valued at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity 
the company develops its products in the united states and markets them in north america  europe  middle east and africa  australia  asia pacific and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
currently  the company has no hedging contracts
