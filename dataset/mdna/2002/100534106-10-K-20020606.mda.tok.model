our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for bad debts our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgements and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable

we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months
