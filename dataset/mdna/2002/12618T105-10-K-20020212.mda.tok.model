item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cra is a leading economic and business consulting firm that applies advanced analytic techniques and in depth industry knowledge to complex engagements for a broad range of clients 
founded in  our firm provides original  authoritative advice to law firms  corporations  and governments worldwide 
we are often retained in high stakes matters  such as multibillion dollar mergers and acquisitions  new product introductions  major capital investment decisions  and complex litigation 
we offer two types of services legal and regulatory consulting and business consulting 
we estimate that we derived approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal from legal and regulatory consulting  approximately percent from business consulting  and approximately percent from neuco 
we derive revenues principally from professional services rendered by our employee consultants 
in most instances  we charge clients on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues in the period when we provide our services 
we charge consultants time at hourly rates  which vary from consultant to consultant depending on a consultant s position  experience  and expertise  and other factors 
outside experts may or may not bill clients directly for their services 
as a result  we generate substantially all of our professional services fees from the work of our own employee consultants 
factors that affect our professional services fees include the number and scope of client engagements  the number of consultants we employ  the consultants billing rates  and the number of hours our consultants work 
in addition to professional service fees  a portion of our revenues represents expenses billed to clients  such as travel and other out of pocket expenses  charges for support staff and outside contractors  and other reimbursable expenses 
our costs of services include the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our employee consultants 
our bonus program awards discretionary bonuses based on our revenues and profitability and individual performance 
costs of services also include out of pocket and other expenses that are billed to clients  and the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of support staff whose time is billed directly to clients  such as librarians  editors  and programmers 
our gross profit  which equals revenues less costs of services  is affected by changes in our mix of revenues 
we experience significantly higher gross margins on revenues from professional service fees than on revenues from expenses billed to clients 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our administrative and support staff  bonuses to outside experts for generating new business  office rent  and marketing and other costs 
in june  we invested approximately  for a majority interest in neuco  inc neuco was established by us and an affiliate of commonwealth energy systems as a start up entity to develop and market a family of neural network software tools and complementary application consulting services for electric utilities 
neuco s financial statements are consolidated with our financial statements 
neuco earned revenues of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal neuco sustained net losses of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal  and generated a net profit of approximately  in fiscal there are no assurances that neuco will remain profitable in the future 
on may   in a series of transactions that resulted in an infusion of new equity in neuco  our ownership interest in neuco was reduced to percent 
the transactions were accounted for as an increase in minority interest and common stock 
the portion of neuco s income or loss allocable to its minority owners is shown as minority interest in our consolidated statements of income  and that amount  together with the capital contributions to neuco of its minority owners  is shown as minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
all significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated 
before may   we owned percent of neuco 
on october   we acquired the consulting business of dr 
gordon c 
rausser for million in cash 
the acquisition price may increase based upon the business meeting specified performance targets over the ensuing three fiscal years 
in addition  we loaned dr 
rausser million  on a full recourse basis  for the purchase of our common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method  and the results have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 

table of contents on july   we acquired certain assets from pa consulting group  inc for million in notes payable 
the acquisition has been accounted for under purchase accounting  and the results of operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
in connection with this acquisition all litigation between pa consulting group and us and our employees  which litigation we described in our form q for the quarterly period ended may   was dismissed with prejudice on july  from fiscal until april  we were taxed as an s corporation and did not pay federal and some state income taxes 
in connection with our initial public offering in april  we terminated our s corporation status  and accordingly  are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which revised the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
specifically  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to amortization  but will be monitored annually for impairment 
any impairment will be measured based upon the fair value of the related asset based upon the provisions of sfas no 
the company intends to elect early adoption of this accounting standard in fiscal year the adoption of this accounting standard is expected to reduce goodwill amortization by approximately  in fiscal year our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in november  and accordingly  our fiscal year will periodically contain weeks rather than weeks 
in fact  fiscal will contain weeks 
this additional week of operations in the fiscal year will affect the comparability of results of operations of these week fiscal years with other fiscal years 
historically  we have managed our business based on a four week billing cycle to clients and  consequently  have established quarters that are divisible by four week periods 
as a result  the first  second  and fourth quarters of each fiscal year are week periods  and the third quarter of each fiscal year is a week period 
however  the fourth quarter in week fiscal years is weeks long 
accordingly  quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful if the quarters being compared have different lengths 
the terms fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to the week periods ended november   november   november   november   and november   respectively

costs of services 
costs of services increased by million  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  costs of services decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a decrease in bonuses paid to employee consultants who source business to us

interest income  net 
net interest income increased by  or percent  from  in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase resulted from interest earned on investments of the proceeds of our public offerings and interest earned by neuco on funds received from a minority partner in the second quarter of fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was essentially the same  amounting to million in each of fiscal and fiscal our effective tax rate increased slightly from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal minority interest 
minority interest in the loss of neuco increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of november   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million  and working capital of million

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  consisting of million used to purchase furniture  fixtures  and computer equipment  offset by net sales of investments 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  consisting principally of payments on notes payable in connection with the acquisition of pa consulting group  inc these notes are payable on a quarterly basis through december  in connection with our acquisition of the consulting business of dr 
rausser  we loaned dr 
rausser million  on a full recourse basis  which he used to purchase shares of our common stock 
the loan is scheduled to be repaid in if the acquired business meets specified performance targets  we will owe dr 
rausser additional consideration  payable in the first quarter of fiscal we currently have available a million revolving line of credit with fleet national bank  which is secured by our accounts receivable 
this line of credit automatically renews each year on june unless earlier terminated by either fleet national bank or us 
no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit as of november  we believe that current cash balances  cash generated from operations and credit available under our bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
factors affecting future performance we depend upon only a few key employees to generate revenue our business consists primarily of the delivery of professional services  and accordingly  our success depends heavily on the efforts  abilities  business generation capabilities  and project execution of our employee consultants 
if we lose the services of any employee consultant or if our employee consultants fail to generate business or otherwise fail to perform effectively  that loss or failure could harm our business 
our employee consultants generated engagements that accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal and fiscal our top five employee consultants generated approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal and percent in fiscal we do not have any employment agreements with our employee consultants  and they can terminate their relationships with us at will and without notice 
the noncompetition agreements that we have with many of our employee consultants offer us only limited protection and may not be enforceable in every jurisdiction 
our failure to manage our expanding business successfully could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations any failure on our part to manage our expanding business successfully could harm our business 
we have continued to open new offices in new geographic areas  including foreign locations  and to expand our employee base as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions 
operations in our foreign offices are subject to foreign currency fluctuations and cultural differences that could affect utilization 
opening and managing new offices requires extensive management supervision and tends to increase our overall selling  general and administrative expenses 
from fiscal to fiscal  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased from percent to percent of our revenues  which contributed to a decline in our net income from fiscal to fiscal expansion creates new and increased management  consulting  and training responsibilities for our employee consultants 
expansion also increases the demands on our internal systems  procedures  and controls  and on our managerial  administrative  financial  marketing and other resources 
we depend heavily upon the managerial  operational  and administrative skills of our officers  particularly james c 
burrows  our president and chief executive officer  to manage our expansion 
new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect the overall quality of our work 
our entry into new lines of business could adversely affect our results of operations if we attempt to develop new practice areas or lines of business outside our core economic and business consulting services  those efforts could harm our results of operations 
our efforts in new practice areas or new 
table of contents lines of business involve inherent risks  including risks associated with inexperience and competition from mature participants in the markets we enter 
our inexperience may result in costly decisions that could harm our business 
clients can terminate engagements with us at any time our engagements generally depend upon disputes  proceedings  or transactions that involve our clients 
our clients may decide at any time to seek to resolve the dispute or proceeding  or abandon the transaction 
our engagements can therefore terminate suddenly and without advance notice to us 
if an engagement is terminated unexpectedly  the employee consultants working on the engagement could be underutilized until we assign them to other projects 
accordingly  the termination or significant reduction in the scope of a single large engagement could harm our business 
we depend on our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions consulting business we derived approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal  and percent in fiscal years and  from engagements in our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions practice areas 
any substantial reduction in the number or size of our engagements in these practice areas could harm our business 
we derived almost all of these revenues from engagements relating to enforcement of united states antitrust laws 
changes in federal antitrust laws  changes in judicial interpretations of these laws  or less vigorous enforcement of these laws as a result of changes in political appointments or priorities or for other reasons could substantially reduce our revenues from engagements in this area 
in addition  adverse changes in general economic conditions  particularly conditions influencing the merger and acquisition activity of larger companies  could also adversely affect engagements in which we assist clients in proceedings before the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
the current economic downturn is adversely affecting mergers and acquisitions activity  which is reducing the number and scope of our engagements in this practice area 
any continuation or worsening of the downturn could cause this trend to intensify  which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we derive our revenues from a limited number of large engagements we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large engagements 
if we do not obtain a significant number of new large engagements each year  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could suffer 
our largest engagements accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal  percent in fiscal  and percent in fiscal our largest clients accounted for approximately percent  percent  and percent of our revenues in those years 
in general  the volume of work we perform for any particular client varies from year to year  and a major client in one year may not hire us again 
our business could suffer if we are unable to hire additional qualified consultants as employees our business requires us to continually hire highly qualified  highly educated consultants as employees 
our failure to recruit and retain a significant number of qualified employee consultants could harm our business 
relatively few potential employees meet our hiring criteria  and we face significant competition for these employees from our direct competitors  academic institutions  government agencies  research firms  investment banking firms  and other enterprises 
many of these competing employers are able to offer potential employees significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths  or geographic locations than we can 
competition for these employee consultants has increased our labor costs  and a continuation of this trend could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations 
we depend on our outside experts we depend on our relationships with our exclusive outside experts 
in each of fiscal and fiscal  six of our exclusive outside experts generated engagements that accounted for approximately percent and 
table of contents percent of our revenues in those years 
we believe that these outside experts are highly regarded in their fields and that each offers a combination of knowledge  experience  and expertise that would be very difficult to replace 
we also believe that we have been able to secure some engagements and attract consultants in part because we could offer the services of these outside experts 
most of these outside experts can limit their relationships with us at any time for any reason 
these reasons could include affiliations with universities with policies that prohibit accepting specified engagements  the pursuit of other interests  and retirement 
twenty two of our approximately outside experts have entered noncompetition agreements with us as of november  the limitation or termination of any of their relationships with us or competition from any of them after these agreements expire could harm our business 
to meet our long term growth targets  we need to establish ongoing relationships with additional outside experts who have reputations as leading experts in their fields 
we may be unable to establish relationships with any additional outside experts 
in addition  any relationship that we do establish may not help us meet our objectives or generate the revenues or earnings that we anticipate 
acquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses 
the expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we acquire a business  we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own 
moreover  we may be unable to achieve the financial  operational  and other benefits we anticipate from any acquisition 
competition for future acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets 
further  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  such as one time charges related to the acquisition diversion of our management s time  attention  and resources loss of key acquired personnel increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial  operational  financial  and administrative systems dilutive issuances of equity securities the assumption of legal liabilities amortization of acquired intangible assets potential write offs related to the impairment of acquired goodwill difficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures additional conflicts of interests the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business 
our international operations create special risks 
we may continue our international expansion  and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special risks  including greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations cultural differences that adversely affect utilization currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
table of contents longer sales cycles restrictions on the repatriation of earnings potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses less stable political and economic environments if our international revenues increase relative to our total revenue  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our operating results 
in any event  any of these factors could seriously harm our business 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations from one quarter to the next 
if our revenues or net income in a quarter fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock could fall significantly 
our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons  including the following the number of weeks in the quarter the number  scope  and timing of ongoing client engagements the extent to which we can reassign employee consultants efficiently from one engagement to the next employee hiring the extent of discounting or cost overruns severe weather conditions and other factors affecting employee productivity collectibility of receivables because we generate almost all of our revenues from consulting services that we provide on an hourly fee basis  our revenues in any period are directly related to the number of our employee consultants  their billing rates  and the number of billable hours they work in that period 
we have a limited ability to increase any of these factors in the short term 
accordingly  if we underutilize our consultants during one part of a fiscal period  we may be unable to compensate by augmenting revenues during another part of that period 
in addition  we are occasionally unable to fully utilize any additional consultants that we hire  particularly in the quarter in which we hire them 
moreover  a significant majority of our operating expenses  primarily office rent and salaries  are fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues fail to meet our projections in any quarter  that could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our net income 
for these reasons  we believe our historical results of operations do not necessarily predict our future performance 
potential conflicts of interests may preclude us from accepting some engagements we provide our services primarily in connection with significant or complex transactions  disputes  or other matters that are usually adversarial or that involve sensitive client information 
our engagement by a client frequently precludes us from accepting engagements with the client s competitors or adversaries because of conflicts between their interests or positions on disputed issues or other reasons 
accordingly  the number of both potential clients and potential engagements is limited 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide consulting services  particularly in the telecommunications industry  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of potential clients for our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to continue some of our ongoing engagements or accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interests 
any of these events could harm our business 

table of contents maintaining our professional reputation is crucial to our future success our ability to secure new engagements and hire qualified consultants as employees depends heavily on our overall reputation as well as the individual reputations of our consultants and principal outside experts 
because we obtain a majority of our new engagements from existing clients or from referrals by those clients  any client that is dissatisfied with our performance on a single matter could seriously impair our ability to secure new engagements 
any factor that diminishes our reputation or the reputations of any of our personnel or outside experts could make it substantially more difficult for us to compete successfully for both new engagements and qualified consultants 
any loss of reputation could harm our business 
intense competition from other economic and business consulting firms could hurt our business the market for economic and business consulting services is intensely competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors 
in general  there are few barriers to entry into our markets  and we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the economic and business consulting industries 
in the legal and regulatory consulting market  we compete primarily with other economic consulting firms and individual academics 
in the business consulting market  we compete primarily with other business and management consulting firms  specialized or industry specific consulting firms  the consulting practices of large accounting firms  and the internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
many of our competitors have national and international reputations as well as significantly greater personnel  financial  managerial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
some of our competitors also have a significantly broader geographic presence than we do 
our engagements may result in professional liability our services typically involve difficult analytical assignments and carry risks of professional and other liability 
many of our engagements involve matters that could have a severe impact on the client s business  cause the client to lose significant amounts of money  or prevent the client from pursuing desirable business opportunities 
accordingly  if a client is dissatisfied with our performance  the client could threaten or bring litigation in order to recover damages or to contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or otherwise breached our obligations to the client could expose us to significant liabilities and tarnish our reputation 
these liabilities could harm our business 
the price of our common stock may be volatile our stock price has been volatile 
from november  to november   the trading price of our common stock ranged from to 
many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including the following variations in our quarterly results of operations the hiring or departure of key personnel or outside experts changes in our professional reputation the introduction of new services by us or our competitors acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors changes in accounting principles changes in the legal and regulatory environment affecting clients changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts future sales of shares of common stock in the public market market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole 
table of contents in addition  the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company 
any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the time and attention of our management and other resources  or otherwise harm our business 
our charter and by laws and massachusetts law may deter takeovers our articles of organization and by laws and massachusetts law contain provisions that could have antitakeover effects and that could discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions  including the election of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of november   we were exposed to market risks  which primarily include changes in us interest rates 
we maintain a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of one year or less and a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of two years or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because these financial instruments are readily marketable  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position
