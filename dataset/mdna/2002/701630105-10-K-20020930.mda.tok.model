item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial information included in this annual report on form k and with factors that may affect future results set forth on page the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  and in part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedule and reports on form k 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgement by our management which subjects them to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying our accounting policies  our management uses its best judgement to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  information available from other outside sources  and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
we believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve more complex management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  and other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product  at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
license fees and royalty income are recognized when earned 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with sfas no 
and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand and  as such our estimate of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory will change  which we will record in the period such determination was made 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of flexible interconnects principally for sale to the automotive  telecommunications and networking  diversified electronics  aerospace and computer markets 
we believe that our development of innovative materials and processes provides us with a competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete 
during the past three fiscal years  we have invested approximately million in property and equipment and approximately million in research and development to develop materials and enhance our manufacturing processes 
we believe that these expenditures will help us to meet customer demand for our products  and enable us to continue to be a technological leader in the flexible interconnect industry 
our research and development expenses are included in our cost of products sold 
we formed a chinese joint venture  parlex shanghai  in to better serve our customers that have production facilities in asia and to more cost effectively manufacture products for worldwide distribution 
effective october   we purchased the share of parlex shanghai held by one of our joint venture partners  shanghai jinling co  ltd s jinling  increasing our equity interest in parlex shanghai to 
parlex shanghai s results of operations  cash flows and financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements 
we are in the process of transferring the production of our automotive related products utilizing our palflex r technology from our methuen  massachusetts facility to parlex interconnect  a wholly owned subsidiary of parlex asia pacific limited  which is located in china 
recent acquisitions on march   we acquired the businesses of poly flex circuits  inc and poly flex circuits limited collectively poly flex  wholly owned subsidiaries of cookson group plc  for a purchase price  including acquisition costs  of approximately million 
this acquisition further diversified our product offerings by providing us with polymer thick film and surface mount assembly capabilities 
poly flex has manufacturing facilities in cranston  rhode island and the united kingdom 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items in our statements of income as a percentage of total revenue 
you should read the table and the discussion below in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
fiscal year ended june  total revenues cost of products sold gross loss profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income loss income from operations before income taxes and minority interest net loss income comparison of years ended june    and total revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of from million reported in fiscal revenues were generated primarily from product sales with decreases in each of our principal product lines  flexible circuits and laminated cable 
reductions in revenues are attributable to the general decline in customer demand within the global electronics industry and a general downturn of the us economy 
this downturn has had a significant impact on parlex s customers and their end markets 
we experienced significant reductions in revenues from our customers in the telecommunications and networking  and computer peripheral markets  which affected all of our manufacturing operations 
while sales are expected to increase  we are not able to predict the time frame within which there will be renewed sales due to the economic uncertainty in these markets  and there is no assurance that sales will not fluctuate significantly in the future 
revenue decline was partially offset by improved performance in the military  automotive  and home appliance markets 
in fiscal  total revenues were million  an increase of from million reported in fiscal our flex circuit operation in methuen experienced a reduction in product sales of million or for fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal the decrease in product sales at the methuen facility was due primarily to a decrease in purchases from customers in the telecommunications industry as a result of excess inventory held by these customers 
the decline in product sales from our methuen operation was offset by the inclusion of additional revenues of million from our poly flex operation  acquired in march  and increased sales from our other operations of million 
total revenues included licensing and royalty fees of approximately  for fiscal   for fiscal and  in fiscal licensing and royalty fees for fiscal included amounts related to our million patent assignment agreement with polyclad laminates  inc the final installment of the polyclad agreement was recognized in fiscal although we intend to continue developing materials and processes that we can license to third parties  we do not expect that licensing and royalty revenues will represent a significant portion of total revenues in the near term 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million  or of total revenues  for fiscal  versus million  or of total revenues for fiscal the increase includes million for the elimination of excess facilities   for severance costs associated with reductions in workforce  and million for increases in inventory reserves and inventory write downs 
in addition  the methuen operation continued to experience low capacity utilization and correspondingly  significant unfavorable manufacturing variances 
in fiscal these variances totaled approximately million and have been charged to cost of products sold 
to improve utilization in fiscal  we will relocate our salem  new hampshire laminated cable business to methuen 
in fiscal  a reduction in force eliminated approximately employees  primarily in the united states  through proactive cost controls  improved operational efficiency and reduced manufacturing volume 
inventory reserves were recorded to reflect increased risk from sustained economic downturn in the electronics industry and in particular the telecommunications market 
during the past year  we have made a significant investment to improve our margins through the transfer of labor intensive manufacturing operations to more cost effective locations 
a large portion of the final assembly  inspection  and test procedures previously performed in our methuen and salem  new hampshire facilities are now performed in mexico 
during fiscal we continued to transfer a significant share of our palflex operations to china 
the transfer of manufacturing capabilities is costly  however this investment is core to our long term strategy for cost effective manufacturing 
although these cost reduction measures are expected to improve our gross margins  a return to profitability is predicated upon operational performance  a favorable product mix and increased sales 
in fiscal  cost of products sold was million  or of total revenues versus million  or of total revenues in fiscal the increase includes a million charge for severance and inventory reserves associated with the slowdown in the technology markets 
in addition  the methuen operation experienced unfavorable manufacturing variances of approximately million or of its total revenues 
the manufacturing variances are due to excess manufacturing capacity associated with a decrease in product sales for fiscal the increase in the cost of products sold in also includes costs associated with our poly flex operation  which was acquired in march selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  or of total revenues  and million or of total revenues for the comparable period in the prior year 
the decreases were primarily the result of continued cost controls mandated by current economic conditions 
decreases were partially offset by investment in a regionally focused corporate sales organization 
these sales teams are responsible for marketing and selling the entire parlex product offering to existing and potential customers within their territories 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for the comparable period in the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of the poly flex operation  which was million for fiscal versus million in fiscal in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses included a charge of million for severance and bad debt allowance associated with the slowdown in our technology markets 
other income and interest expense and provision for income taxes 
other income of  was primarily comprised of interest income on short term investments 
in fiscal  other income of  was comprised of interest income from short term investments and  received relative to the settlement of legal claims associated with our methuen building addition 
interest expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal the interest expense represents interest incurred on our short and long term borrowings for working capital needs and interest expense associated with deferred compensation 
the increase in fiscal represents the interest on our borrowings required to finance our poly flex acquisition 
our loss before income taxes and the minority interest in our chinese joint venture  parlex shanghai  was million and million for fiscal years and respectfully 
we earned income of million for fiscal we own of the equity interest in parlex shanghai and  accordingly  include parlex shanghai s results of operations  cash flows and financial position in our consolidated financial statements 
our effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from net operating losses generated in lower tax jurisdictions and a decreased amount of available tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
net cash used in operations during fiscal was million 
operating losses of million adjusted for minority interest  depreciation and amortization  used million of operating cash 
this was offset by million generated from a reduction in our working capital requirements 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal these funds were used to purchase million of capital equipment and other assets  and to acquire our joint venture partner s minority interest in parlex shanghai for million 
cash generated from investing activities included the sale of higher yielding investment grade corporate and united states government debt securities of million and  received from cookson group plc as a final settlement related to our fiscal acquisition of the poly flex business 
cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal  and represented the net borrowings and repayments on our bank debt 
net cash used in operations during fiscal was million 
the decrease in operating cash resulted from an increase in working capital including million in payments to our suppliers 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal these funds were used to purchase million of higher yielding investment grade corporate and united states government debt securities and million of capital equipment expenditures net of  received from cookson group plc as partial settlement of certain purchase price adjustments related to the poly flex acquisition 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and represented the net borrowings and repayments of our bank debt and cash received through the exercise of stock options 
in june  our subsidiary  parlex interconnect  executed a  loan agreement the loan agreement with citic ka wah bank limited  a hong kong bank 
proceeds received under the loan agreement are to be used exclusively for financing land  building  plant and machinery and other working capital requirements and to prepay parlex interconnect s two current short term bank notes with combined outstanding balances of million as of june  as of june   no amounts were outstanding under the loan agreement 
borrowings under the loan agreement accrue interest at a fixed rate equal to libor plus a margin of 
interest is payable at the end of each interest period which varies from one to six months 
as a condition of the approval of this loan agreement  our subsidiary  parlex asia pacific ltd  and we have provided a guarantee of the payment of this loan 
the loan agreement contains a cross default provision that would permit the lender to accelerate the repayment of our obligation under the loan agreement in the event of our default on other financing arrangements 
as of august   total borrowings were million 
these borrowings were used to repay local short term bank notes of million and fund future equipment and working capital requirements 
on april   we executed the second amendment to our loan agreement the credit agreement originally dated march  
the credit agreement provided our bank with a secured interest in all of our assets with the exception of our real estate 
we may borrow up to a total of  based on a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and marketable securities 
no further advances of principal will be made under this credit agreement after december  at our discretion  borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at either a variable rate equal to the bank s prime rate at june  or a fixed rate equal to libor plus a margin that varies from to 
as of june  we have  as provided for under our credit agreement  converted million of our credit agreement borrowings into libor contracts with maturities of three months 
the libor plus margin for these contracts varies between and 
interest on the libor contracts is payable at the end of each libor term 
the credit agreement carries an annual commitment fee of to on the average daily unused portion of the bank s commitment 
interest is payable monthly 
the credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit  which reduce our availability for borrowings under the credit agreement  and which a  letter of credit is outstanding at june  the credit agreement permits us to pay cash dividends to the extent that such payment would not cause us to violate the aforementioned covenants 
the credit agreement has certain restrictive covenants related to current ratio  tangible net worth  total liabilities to tangible net worth  interest coverage ratio  debt service coverage ratio and income and capital expenditure targets 
as of june   we were not in compliance with the restrictive covenants related to income targets and tangible net worth coverage and our outstanding advances under the credit agreement exceeded the allowable borrowing base 
we received a waiver of all covenant violations at june  we have executed a third amendment to the credit agreement as of september  and are now in compliance with all covenants and our advances are within the borrowing base 
on september   we executed the third amendment to our loan agreement the third amendment 
the third amendment increases our bank s security interest to include a first mortgage on our methuen  massachusetts facility 
in addition  our total availability for borrowings under the credit agreement was reduced to  at september  and will be reduced to  by march  the borrowing base was amended so as to be calculated as of eligible accounts receivable plus of the appraised value of the methuen facility  less amounts outstanding under letters of credit 
the third amendment also amends the restrictive covenants for periods subsequent to june  to remove the interest coverage ratio  amend the definition of minimum tangible net worth  and amend the future income targets 
at june  we are in compliance with the restrictive covenants  as amended  and anticipate being in compliance with the terms of the amended agreement for the foreseeable future 
throughout fiscal and into fiscal  we took a series of steps to reduce operating expenses and to restructure operations  which consisted primarily of reductions in workforce and consolidating manufacturing operations 
we continue to implement plans to control operating expenses  inventory levels  and capital expenditures as well as plans to manage accounts payable and accounts receivable to enhance cash flows and maintain compliance with the restrictive covenants under the credit agreement 
our plan includes the following actions consolidation of some of our manufacturing facilities  including the closing of the salem  new hampshire facility during fiscal  the transfer of certain manufacturing processes from our domestic operations to our lower cost international manufacturing operations  particularly those in the people s republic of china  expand our products in the home appliance  laptop computer  and radio identification frequency and smart card markets  and the continued monitoring and reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
furthermore  we are exploring alternative financing arrangements to partially replace or supplement our financing arrangements to provide us with longer term financing to support our current working capital needs 
we believe that our cash on hand and cash expected to be generated during fiscal will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating obligations for the foreseeable future 
if we require alternative external financing to repay or refinance our existing financing obligations or fund our working capital requirements  we believe that we will be able to obtain new external financing 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such new financing 
recent accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement on financial accounting standards no  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  if an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life  it shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment  for each reporting unit  on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in accordance with the guidelines in sfas  we determined we have one reporting unit 
upon adoption of sfas  we performed an impairment review and concluded that there are no necessary adjustments

we are currently evaluating the impact  but do not expect a material impact  resulting from the adoption of sfas nos 
  and on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
our future results may differ materially from the current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our business could continue to be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
our operating results have been materially adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced electronics industry spending 
if economic and market conditions do not improve  our business  results of operations or financial condition could continue to be materially adversely affected 
if we cannot obtain additional financing when needed  we may not be able to expand our operations and invest adequately in research and development  which could cause us to lose customers and market share 
the development and manufacturing of flexible interconnects is capital intensive 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  expansion of operations and research and development 
we expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
we may need to raise additional funds either through borrowings or further equity financings 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise the required funds when needed  we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose revenue and market share 
our operating results fluctuate and may fail to satisfy the expectations of public market analysts and investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect our results to continue to fluctuate in the future 
our results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including the timing and volume of orders from customers  the timing of introductions of and market acceptance of new products  changes in prices of raw materials  variations in production yields and general economic trends 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or exceed the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our quarterly results depend upon a small number of large orders received in each quarter  so the loss of any single large order could harm quarterly results and cause our stock price to drop 
a substantial portion of our sales in any given quarter depends on obtaining a small number of large orders for products to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which the orders are received 
although we attempt to monitor our customers needs  we often have limited knowledge of the magnitude or timing of future orders 
it is difficult for us to reduce spending on short notice on operating expenses such as fixed manufacturing costs  development costs and ongoing customer service 
as a result  a reduction in orders  or even the loss of a single large order  for products to be shipped in any given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
this  in turn  could cause our stock price to decline 
because we sell a substantial portion of our products to a limited number of customers  the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer would harm our operating results 
historically we have sold a substantial portion of our products to a limited number of customers 
our largest customers based on sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our total revenues in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer would cause our revenues to decline and have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unable to respond effectively to the evolving technological requirements of customers  our products may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and we may lose revenues and market share 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities 
we will need to develop and market products that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the materials and processes that we are currently developing will result in commercially viable technological processes  or that there will be commercial applications for these technologies 
in addition  we may not be able to make the capital investments required to develop  acquire or implement new technologies and equipment that are necessary to remain competitive 
it is also possible that the flexible interconnect industry could encounter competition from new technologies in the future that render flexible interconnect technology less competitive or obsolete 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change  our products may become less competitive or obsolete and we may lose customers and revenues 
a significant downturn in any of the sectors in which we sell products could result in a revenue shortfall 
we sell our flexible interconnect products principally to the automotive  telecommunications and networking  diversified electronics  aerospace  home appliance and computer markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one sector  a significant downturn in any of these market sectors could cause a material reduction in our revenues  which could be difficult to replace 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers  and any interruption in our primary sources of supply  or any significant increase in the prices of materials  chemicals or components  would have an adverse effect on our short term operating results 
we purchase the bulk of our raw materials  process chemicals and components from a limited number of outside sources 
in fiscal  we purchased approximately of our materials from dupont and northfield acquisition co 
doing business as sheldahl  our two largest suppliers 
we operate under tight manufacturing cycles with a limited inventory of raw materials 
as a result  although there are alternative sources of the materials that we purchase from our existing suppliers  any unanticipated interruption in supply from dupont or sheldahl  or any significant increase in the prices of materials  chemicals or components  would have an adverse effect on our short term operating results 
if we acquire additional businesses  these acquisitions will involve financial uncertainties as well as personnel contingencies  and may be risky and difficult to integrate 
we have completed two acquisitions in the past four years and we may acquire additional businesses that could complement or expand our business 
acquired businesses may not generate the revenues or profits that we expect and we may find that they have unknown or undisclosed liabilities 
in addition  if we do make acquisitions  we will face a number of other risks and challenges  including the difficulty of integrating dissimilar operations or assets  potential loss of key employees of the acquired business  assimilation of new employees who may not contribute or perform at the levels we expect  diversion of management time and resources  and additional costs associated with obtaining any necessary financing 
these factors could hamper our ability to receive the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions we may pursue  and could adversely affect our financial condition and our stock price 
the additional expenses and risks related to our existing international operations  as well as any expansion of our global operations  could adversely affect our business 
we own a equity interest in our joint venture in china  parlex shanghai  which manufactures and sells flexible circuits 
we also operate a facility in mexico for use in the finishing  assembly and testing of flexible circuit and laminated cable products 
we have a facility in the united kingdom where we manufacture polymer thick film flexible circuits and polymer thick film flexible circuits with surface mounted components and intend to introduce production of laminated cable within the next year 
we will continue to explore appropriate expansion opportunities as demand for our products increases 
manufacturing and sales operations outside the united states carry a number of risks inherent in international operations  including imposition of governmental controls  regulatory standards and compulsory licensure requirements  compliance with a wide variety of foreign and us import and export laws  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in trade restrictions  tariffs and barriers  political and economic instability  longer payment cycles typically associated with foreign sales  difficulties in administering business overseas  labor union issues  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
international expansion may require significant management attention  which could negatively affect our business 
we may also incur significant costs to expand our existing international operations or enter new international markets  which could increase operating costs and reduce our profitability 
we face significant competition  which could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
we face competition worldwide in the flexible interconnect market from a number of foreign and domestic providers  as well as from alternative technologies such as rigid printed circuits 
many of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources 
new competitors could also enter our markets 
our competitors may be able to duplicate our strategies  or they may develop enhancements to  or future generations of  products that could offer price or performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures could also necessitate price reductions  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products priced in other currencies 
we will need to make a continued high level of investment in product research and development and research  sales and marketing and ongoing customer service and support in order to remain competitive 
we may not have sufficient resources to be able to make these investments 
moreover  we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position in the flexible interconnect market 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate key personnel  we may not be able to develop  sell and support our products and our business may lack strategic direction 
we are dependent upon key members of our management team 
in addition  our future success will depend in large part upon our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining such personnel 
we currently maintain a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million on each of herbert w 
pollack and peter j 
murphy 
if we lose the service of messrs 
pollack or murphy or one or more other key individuals  or are unable to attract additional qualified members of the management team  our ability to implement our business strategy may be impaired 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical and sales personnel  we may not be able to develop  sell and support our products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be harmed and our revenues could be adversely affected 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we own patents issued and have patent applications pending in the united states and have several corresponding foreign patent applications pending 
our existing patents may not effectively protect our intellectual property and could be challenged by third parties  and our future patent applications  if any  may not be approved 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies 
competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our competitors could offer similar products using materials  processes or technologies developed by us  potentially harming our competitive position and our revenues 
if we become involved in a protracted intellectual property dispute  or one with a significant damages award or which requires us to cease selling some of our products  we could be subject to significant liability and the time and attention of our management could be diverted 
although no claims have been asserted against us for infringement of the proprietary rights of others  we may be subject to a claim of infringement in the future 
an intellectual property lawsuit against us  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
a successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling  or redesign  products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property 
we could also be required to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology 
we might not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to develop a non infringing technology on a timely basis or to license the infringed technology on acceptable terms  our revenues could decline and our expenses could increase 
we may in the future be required to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
litigation with respect to patents and other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other aspects of our business 
market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile  and our stock price may be volatile as well 
from time to time the us stock market has experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices for the common stock of technology companies in particular have been extremely volatile 
in the past  broad market fluctuations that have affected the stock price of technology companies have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
if we were to become involved in this type of litigation  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management s attention  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our operating expenses and reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  product or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these regulations  could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we could also be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured
