c narrative description of business cement  aggregate and concrete the cac business segment includes the manufacture and sale of cement  aggregates  ready mix concrete  concrete block and brick 
production and distribution facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california  with markets extending into contiguous states 
in addition  txi has certain patented and unpatented mining claims in southern california which contain deposits of limestone 
the company does not place heavy reliance on patents  franchises  licenses or concessions related to its cac operations 
cement txi s cement operations produce portland cement as its principal product 
also produced are specialty cements such as white  masonry and oil well 
cement production facilities are located at four sites in texas and california midlothian  texas  south of dallas fort worth  the largest cement plant in texas  hunter  texas  south of austin  and oro grande and crestmore  california  both near los angeles 
except for the crestmore facility  the limestone reserves used as the primary raw material are located on fee owned property adjacent to each of the plants 
raw material for the crestmore facility is purchased from outside suppliers 
information regarding each of the company s facilities is as follows plant rated annual productive capacity tons of clinker manufacturing process service date estimated minimum reserves years midlothian  tx dry wet hunter  tx dry oro grande  ca dry crestmore  ca dry n a the company uses its patented cemstar process in both of its texas facilities and its oro grande  california facility to increase combined annual production by approximately 
the cemstar process adds slag  a co product of steel making  into a cement kiln along with the regular raw material feed 
the slag serves to increase the production of clinker which is then ground to make cement 
the primary fuel source for all of the company s facilities is coal  however  the company displaces approximately of its coal needs at its midlothian plant and approximately of its coal needs at its hunter plant by utilizing alternative fuels 
the company s facilities also consume large amounts of electricity obtained primarily under fixed price firm supply contracts of short duration 
the company believes that adequate supplies of both fuel and electricity are readily available 
the company produced approximately million tons of finished cement in  million tons in and million tons in total annual shipments of finished cement were approximately million tons in  million tons in and million tons in of which million tons in  million tons in and million tons in were shipped to outside trade customers 
the company markets its cement products throughout the southwestern united states 
the principal marketing area includes the states of texas  louisiana  oklahoma  california  nevada  arizona and utah 
sales offices are maintained throughout the marketing area and sales are made primarily to numerous customers in the construction industry  no one of which accounted for more than ten percent of the trade sales volume in cement is distributed by rail or truck to eight distribution terminals located throughout the marketing area 
the cement industry is highly competitive with suppliers differentiating themselves based on price  service and quality 
aggregate  concrete and other products txi s aggregate operations  which include sand  gravel  crushed limestone and expanded shale and clay  is conducted from facilities primarily serving the dallas fort worth  austin and houston areas in texas  the alexandria  new orleans  baton rouge and monroe areas in louisiana  the oakland san francisco and los angeles areas in california  and the denver area in colorado 
the following table summarizes certain information about the registrant s aggregate production facilities type of facility and general location number of plants estimated annual productive capacity estimated minimum reserves years crushed limestone north central south texas million tons sand gravel north central texas million tons central texas million tons louisiana million tons south central oklahoma million tons expanded shale clay north central south texas million cu

reserves identified with the facilities shown above and additional reserves available to support future plant sites are contained on approximately  acres of land  of which approximately  acres are owned in fee and the remainder leased 
the expanded shale and clay plants operated at percent of practical capacity for with sales of approximately million cubic yards 
production for the remaining aggregate facilities was percent of practical capacity and sales for the year totaled million tons  of which approximately million tons were shipped to outside trade customers 
in addition  the registrant owns and operates three industrial sand plants and an aggregate blending facility 
the cost of transportation limits the marketing of these various aggregates to the areas relatively close to the plant sites 
consequently  sales of these products are related to the level of construction activity near these plants 
these products are marketed by the company s sales organization located in the areas served by the plants and are sold to numerous customers  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
the distribution of these products is provided to trade customers principally by contract or customer owned haulers  and a limited amount of these products is distributed by rail for affiliated usage 
the company s ready mix concrete operations are situated in three areas in texas dallas fort worth denton  houston and east texas  in north and central louisiana  and at one location in southern arkansas 
the following table summarizes various information concerning these facilities location number of plants number of trucks texas louisiana arkansas the plants listed above are located on sites owned or leased by the company 
txi manufactures and supplies a substantial amount of the cement and aggregates used by the ready mix plants with the remainder being purchased from outside suppliers 
ready mix concrete is sold to various contractors in the construction industry  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
the major concrete products manufactured and marketed by the company are summarized below products locations prepackaged concrete and related products dallas fort worth  texas austin  texas cresson  texas houston  texas bossier city  louisiana concrete block alexandria  louisiana bossier city  louisiana monroe  louisiana clay brick athens  texas mineral wells  texas mooringsport  louisiana the plant or distribution sites in the above locations are owned by the company 
the products are marketed by the company s sales force in each of these locations  and are primarily delivered by trucks owned by the company 
because the cost of delivery is significant to the overall cost of most of these products  the market area is generally restricted to within approximately one hundred miles of the plant locations 
these products are sold to various contractors  owners and distributors  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
in most of txi s principal markets for concrete products  the company competes vigorously with at least three other vertically integrated concrete companies 
the company believes that it is a significant participant in each of the texas and louisiana concrete products markets 
the principal methods of competition in concrete products markets are quality and service at competitive prices 
steel txi s steel facilities  located in midlothian  texas and dinwiddie county  virginia  follow a market mill concept which entails the low cost production of a broader array of steel products than a traditional mini mill 
txi uses its patented near net shape casting technology at both facilities 
the process provides energy and capital cost savings in the making of wide flange beams and other structural steel products 
the texas facility has two electric arc furnaces with continuous casters that feed melted steel to a bar mill  a structural mill and a large beam mill 
finished rolled products produced include beams up to twenty four inches wide  merchant bar quality rounds  special bar quality rounds  reinforcing bar and channels 
the virginia facility has one electric arc furnace and in line processing units consisting of two near net shape casters and a sophisticated rolling mill 
finished products produced include beams up to thirty six inches wide  sheet piling  h piling and channels 
the rated annual capacities of the operating facilities are as follows rated annual productive capacity tons approximate facility square footage texas melting rolling virginia melting rolling the bar and structural mills produced approximately million tons of finished products in  million tons in and million tons in the principal raw material is recycled steel 
shredded steel represents approximately of the raw material mix 
a major portion of the shredded steel requirements of the texas facility is produced by an on site shredder operation utilizing primarily crushed auto bodies purchased on the open market 
the company purchases shredded steel on the open market to meet the requirements of the virginia facility 
another grade of recycled steel  heavy  representing approximately of the raw material mix is also purchased on the open market 
the purchase price of recycled steel is subject to market forces largely beyond the company s control 
the supply of recycled steel is expected to be adequate to meet future requirements 
the steel mills consume large amounts of electricity and natural gas 
electricity for the texas facility is obtained from a local utility under fixed price firm supply contracts typically of short duration 
electricity for the virginia facility is obtained from a local utility under an interruptible supply contract with price adjustments that reflect increases or decreases in the utility s fuel costs 
natural gas is obtained from local gas utilities under supply contracts 
the company believes that adequate supplies of both electricity and natural gas are readily available 
the company s steel products are marketed throughout the united states and to a limited extent in canada and mexico 
sales are primarily to steel service centers and steel fabricators for use in the construction industry  as well as  to cold finishers  forgers and original equipment manufacturers for use in the railroad  defense  automotive  mobile home and energy industries 
the company does not place heavy reliance on franchises  licenses or concessions 
none of txi s customers accounted for more than ten percent of the steel segment s sales in sales to affiliates are minimal 
orders are generally filled within days and are cancelable 
delivery of finished products is accomplished by common carrier  customer owned trucks  rail or barge 
the company competes with steel producers  including foreign producers  on the basis of price  quality and service 
certain of the foreign and domestic competitors  including both large integrated steel producers and mini mills  have substantially greater assets and larger sales organizations than txi 
intense sales competition exists for substantially all of the steel segment s products 
risks relating to the company competition all of the markets in which the company participates are highly competitive 
the company competes in each of its cement  aggregate and concrete products markets with several other domestic suppliers of these products as well as with importers of foreign cement 
the company competes in its steel markets with national and international producers of steel products 
some of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have less financial leverage than the company 
the company competes on the basis of  among other things  competitive prices  prompt availability  customer service and quality products 
sensitivity to economic cycles  seasonality and weather a significant percentage of the company s sales of both cac and steel products is attributable to the level of construction activity  which is affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer spending habits and employment 
the company s cac operating profit is generally lower in its fiscal quarter ended february as compared to the other three fiscal quarters due to the impact of winter weather on construction activity 
extended periods of inclement weather can adversely impact construction activity at other times of the year as well 
steel results are also affected by the company s shut downs scheduled every twelve to twenty four months to refurbish its steel production facilities 
growth strategy a significant element of the company s operating strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions that either expand or complement the company s products or markets or to build new or expand existing production facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms  that the company will be able to obtain the permits necessary to build new or expand existing production facilities  that the company will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions or expansions on acceptable terms or that the company will be able successfully to integrate such acquisitions into existing operations 
availability and pricing of raw materials the company is dependent upon purchased scrap steel as a raw material and upon energy sources  including electricity and fossil fuels 
accordingly  the company s results of operations and financial condition have in the past been  and may again in the future be adversely affected by increases in raw material costs or energy costs  or their lack of availability 
status of certain tariffs a group of domestic cement producers  including the company  filed antidumping petitions which have resulted in the imposition of significant antidumping duty cash deposits on grey portland cement and clinker imported from mexico and japan 
in addition  the us department of commerce has signed agreements with the venezuelan government and venezuelan cement producers  which are designed to eliminate the dumping and illegal subsidization of grey portland cement and clinker from venezuela 
on an annual basis  the antidumping duties are subject to review by the department of commerce to determine whether the current antidumping duty deposit rates should be adjusted upward or downward 
in  the antidumping code of general agreement on tariffs and trade was substantially altered pursuant to the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations 
us legislation approving and implementing the uruguay round agreements requires the department of commerce and the us international trade commission itc to conduct sunset reviews of all outstanding antidumping and countervailing duty orders and suspension agreements  including the antidumping orders against grey portland cement and clinker from mexico and japan and the suspension agreements on grey portland cement and clinker from venezuela  to determine whether they should be terminated or remain in effect 
in  the department of commerce and the itc conducted sunset reviews of the antidumping orders and suspension agreements and determined that they should remain in effect for another five years 
in july  complaints were filed with the itc and the us department of commerce by the company  northwestern steel wire co  nucor yamato steel co 
and the united steelworkers of america seeking to impose antidumping and countervailing duties against imports of structural steel beams from germany  japan  south korea and spain 
in june and july  the itc made respective determinations that an industry in the united states is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of such imports from japan and korea that the department of commerce has determined are subsidized and sold in the united states at less than fair value 
as a result of the itc s affirmative determinations  the department of commerce directed the us customs service to impose countervailing and antidumping duties on imports of certain structural steel beams from these two countries 
however  imports of structural steel beams from other countries increased significantly and the committee for fair beam imports composed of northwestern steel wire co  nucor corp  nucor yamato steel co 
and the company again petitioned the itc and the u 
s 
department of commerce concerning imports of certain structural steel beams from china  germany  luxembourg  russia  south africa  spain and taiwan 
on june   the itc determined that  although the department of commerce had determined that these imports were being sold in the united states at less than fair value  such imports did not materially injure or threaten with material injury an industry in the united states 
impact of environmental laws the operations of the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal and state environmental laws and regulations environmental laws or laws 
under these laws  the us environmental protection agency epa and agencies of state government have the authority to promulgate regulations which could result in substantial expenditures for pollution control and solid waste treatment and disposal 
three major areas regulated by these authorities are air quality  waste management and water quality 
emissions sources at the company s facilities are regulated by a combination of permit limitations and emission standards of statewide application  and the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with its permit limitations and laws and regulations applicable to its existing facilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that future changes in permit limitations and emission standards will not adversely affect the company s ability to build new or expand existing production facilities 
many of the raw materials  products and by products associated with the operation of any industrial facility  including those for the production of steel  cement or concrete products  contain chemical elements or compounds that can be designated as hazardous substances 
such raw materials  products and by products may also exhibit characteristics that result in their being classified as a hazardous substance or waste 
some examples are the metals present in cement kiln dust ckd  electric arc furnace dust eaf dust generated by the company s steel facilities and the ignitability of the waste derived fuels which the company uses as a primary or supplementary fuel substitute for nonrenewable coal and natural gas to fire its cement kilns 
currently  ckd is exempt from hazardous waste management standards under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra if certain tests are satisfied 
txi has demonstrated that the ckd it generates satisfies these tests 
however  the epa plans to apply site specific waste management standards to ckd under the clean air act and rcra to assure that the environment is protected 
the company has established operating practices and is implementing waste management programs which it believes will comply with these anticipated standards  but there can be no assurances that such practices and programs will continue to comply in the future if regulations become more restrictive 
the company utilizes hazardous materials such as gasoline  acids  solvents and chemicals as well as the materials that have been designated or characterized as hazardous waste by the epa  which the company utilizes for energy recovery 
this necessitates the company familiarize its work force with the more exacting requirements of applicable environmental laws and regulations with respect to human health and the environment related to these activities 
the failure to observe these exacting requirements could jeopardize the company s hazardous waste management permits and  under certain circumstances  expose the company to significant liabilities and costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances into the environment or claims by employees or others alleging exposure to hazardous substances 
the company s steel facilities generate  in the same manner as other similar steel plants in the industry  eaf dust that contains lead  chromium and cadmium 
the epa has listed this eaf dust  which is collected in baghouses  as hazardous waste 
the company has contracts with reclamation facilities in the united states and mexico pursuant to which such facilities receive the eaf dust generated by the company and recover the metals from the dust for reuse  thus rendering the dust non hazardous 
in addition  the company is continually investigating alternative reclamation technologies and has implemented processes for diminishing the amount of eaf dust generated 
the company intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment  but since many of these requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable  presently not determinable  or are likely to be affected by future legislation or rule making by government agencies  it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs of compliance and their effect on the company s operations  future net income or financial condition 
notwithstanding such compliance  if damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment has been or is caused by the conduct of the company s business or hazardous substances or wastes used in  generated or disposed of by the company  the company may be liable for such damages and be required to pay the cost of investigation and remediation of such contamination 
the amount of such liability could be material and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material liability in connection with possible claims related to the company s operations and properties under environmental laws 
other items txi has approximately  employees  employed in cac operations   employed in steel operations and the balance employed in corporate resources 
the company is involved in the development of its surplus real estate and real estate acquired for development of high quality industrial  office and multi use parks in the metropolitan areas of dallas fort worth and houston  texas and richmond  virginia

this reflects a million decrease in interest incurred as a result of lower average outstanding debt at lower interest rates offset by a million decrease in interest capitalized 
with the completion of the company s major plant expansions no interest was capitalized in interest expense in increased million from the prior year due to a million increase in interest incurred as a result of higher average outstanding debt offset by a million increase in interest capitalized 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  in and in the primary reason that the current tax rate differs from the statutory corporate rate is due to percentage depletion that is tax deductible and state income tax expense 
dividends on preferred securities net of tax dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary net of tax benefit amounted to million in each of the three years in the period ending critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more complex judgments and estimates 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the company s products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
goodwill 
management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the applicable reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the company s products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
environmental liabilities 
the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and makes provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity  in addition to cash from operations  include a credit facility and an agreement to sell trade accounts receivable 
the company has available a revolving credit facility which expires in march as provided by the terms of agreement  the company has elected to reduce the borrowing capacity of the facility from million to million effective august  at may   million was outstanding under the facility and an additional million had been utilized to support letters of credit 
the company s total debt  including debt under the facility  is limited based on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at may   million of additional debt could have been incurred 
the company s agreement to sell on a revolving basis an interest in a defined pool of trade accounts receivable of up to million is subject to annual renewal 
at may   the entire amount available under this agreement had been sold 
cash from operations funded debt reductions of million and capital expenditures of million 
the long term debt to total capitalization ratio was reduced from to 
the company generally finances its major capital expansion projects with cash from operations and long term borrowing 
maintenance capital expenditures and working capital are funded by cash from operations 
in addition  the company leases certain mobile and other equipment used in its operations under operating leases which in the normal course of business are renewed or replaced by other leases 
at may   the company s estimated future payments under its contractual obligations are summarized  as follows total future payments by period after in thousands long term debt operating leases preferred securities of subsidiary total contractual obligations future payments under leases exclude mineral rights which are insignificant and are generally required only for products produced 
outstanding letters of credit generally only collateralize payment of recorded liabilities 
the company expects cash from operations  borrowings under its current or similar revolving credit facility and its agreement to sell trade accounts receivable to be sufficient to provide funds for capital expenditure commitments  scheduled debt repayments and working capital needs 
cash flows net cash provided by operations was million in  compared to million in the prior year 
increased net income and deferred taxes were offset in part by changes in working capital items 
higher steel shipments increased receivables million 
cac receivables declined million and raw material and supply inventories grew million as wet weather in the company s texas markets reduced ready mix and aggregate sales in the may quarter 
collection of tax refund claims reduced receivables million 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million due primarily to lower trade accounts payable 
deferred taxes include a million alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that is available for offset against future regular income taxes 
net cash used by investing activities was million in  compared to million in the prior year  consisting principally of capital expenditure items 
capital expenditures for normal replacement and technological upgrades of existing equipment and expansions of the company s operations excluding major plant expansions were million  down million from the fiscal year capital expenditure budget is estimated currently at approximately million 
in  million was incurred in completing the expansion of the company s midlothian  texas cement plant 
net cash used by financing activities was million in  compared to million in the prior year 
long term debt was reduced million 
in  the company purchased  at a cost of million  approximately  shares of its common stock for general corporate purposes 
the company s quarterly cash dividend at 
per common share remained unchanged from the prior year 
other items litigation in november  chaparral steel company  a wholly owned subsidiary  filed an action in the district court of ellis county  texas against certain graphite electrode suppliers seeking damages for illegal restraints of trade in the sale of graphite electrodes 
the company has obtained settlements from the major producers of graphite electrodes named in the action 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  air emissions  furnace dust disposal and wastewater discharge 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  however  from time to time the company receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that the company is or may be in violation of certain environmental laws and regulations 
based on its experience and the information currently available to it  the company believes that such claims will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
despite the company s compliance and experience  it is possible that the company could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable
