ebitda  before pre opening expenses is defined as ebitda adjusted to exclude costs incurred during development and prior to the opening of a facility pre opening expenses 
ebitda and ebitda  before pre opening expenses should not be considered measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
items excluded from ebitda and ebitda  before pre opening expenses are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
ebitda and ebitda  before pre opening expenses are key measures used by management to evaluate our consolidated operations and provide useful information to investors 
ebitda and ebitda  before pre opening expenses should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities  or performance or liquidity 
because ebitda and ebitda  before pre opening expenses are not measurements determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  these measurements as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements of other companies

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and related financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we focus primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we design  develop  own and operate hospitals in partnership with physicians  most of whom are cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons 
while each of our hospitals is a freestanding  licensed general acute care hospital  we focus on serving the unique needs of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease 
since january  we have developed ten hospitals in seven states  including arizona  arkansas  california  new mexico  ohio  south dakota and texas  where we opened our newest hospital in harlingen  texas on october  as of december   we had nine hospitals in operation with a total of licensed beds and had sold one hospital in mcallen  texas 
we are currently in the process of developing our tenth hospital  which will be a heart hospital located in st 
tammany parish just north of new orleans  louisiana  our eleventh hospital  which will be a heart hospital located in san antonio  texas  our twelfth hospital  which will be a heart hospital located in glendale  near milwaukee  wisconsin  and our thirteenth hospital  which will be a heart hospital located in lafayette  louisiana 
we expect to open these four new hospitals during march st 
tammany parish  the late summer of san antonio  and the fall of glendale and lafayette 
these four new hospitals are expected to have a total of licensed beds 
our hospital division accounted for of our net revenue for our fiscal year ended september  in addition to our hospitals  we provide cardiovascular care services in diagnostic and therapeutic facilities located in eight states and through mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories 
we also provide consulting and management services tailored primarily to cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons 
we completed our initial public offering in july by issuing  new shares of our common stock at a price of per share  thereby generating aggregate gross proceeds of million 
we recognized net proceeds from the public offering of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
concurrent with the public offering  we completed a series of transactions that we undertook to prepare for the public offering and to increase our ownership interest in some of our hospitals 
first  we established medcath corporation as our new holding company by issuing  shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our predecessor holding company  medcath holdings  inc second  we completed a series of transactions in which we issued  shares of our common stock valued at the public offering price and paid approximately million cash to acquire additional ownership interests in five of our hospitals from our physician and hospital partners in each of those hospitals 
the shares of common stock issued in these transactions were in addition to the shares sold in the public offering 
the cash paid in these transactions was financed with a portion of the net proceeds from the public offering 
hospital ownership and capital structure each of our hospitals is organized as either a limited liability company or limited partnership  with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries serving as the manager or general partner and typically holding from to of the ownership interest in the entity 
in most cases  our physician partners own the remaining ownership interests as members or limited partners 
in some instances  local market conditions have made it advantageous for us to organize a hospital with a community hospital investing as a partner in addition to physicians 
in three of our hospitals  there are hospital partners that hold ownership interests of  and 
we include in our consolidated financial statements hospitals over which we exercise substantive control  including all hospitals in which we own more than a interest 
we use the equity method of accounting for hospitals in which we hold less than a interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control 
the following table identifies our hospital ownership percentages as of the end of each of our three most recent fiscal years

heart hospital of san antonio san antonio  tx late summer the heart hospital of milwaukee glendale wi fall heart hospital of lafayette lafayette  la fall as a result of the increase in our ownership interest in tucson heart hospital from a minority to a majority ownership position in july  we obtained substantive control of that hospital and began consolidating in our financial statements the hospital s results of operations and financial position from the date of acquisition 
we had previously been required to use the equity method of accounting for tucson heart hospital  which means that we included in our consolidated statement of operations only a percentage of the hospital s reported net income or loss for each reporting period as equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
during our fiscal year  we also included in our consolidated financial statements one hospital  dayton heart hospital  in which we owned less than a interest  but over which we exercised substantive control 
at the beginning of our fiscal year  we obtained a greater than interest in dayton heart hospital due to our community hospital partner forfeiting its interest in that hospital 
effective october   we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the public offering to an acquire additional ownership interest in our heart hospital of new mexico from our physician and hospital partners 
the acquisition increased our ownership interest in the heart hospital of new mexico from a minority ownership position to a majority ownership position  and we obtained substantive control of the hospital 
accordingly  we began to consolidate in our financial statements the hospital s results of operations and financial position from october  the first day of our fiscal year 
before acquiring this additional interest  we were required to account for our investment in the heart hospital of new mexico using the equity method of accounting  which means that we included in our consolidated statement of operations only a percentage of the hospital s reported net income or loss for each reporting period as equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
as of october  the first day of our fiscal year  our heart hospital of south dakota is the only hospital in which we do not have a majority ownership interest and for which we do not consolidate the hospital s results of operations and financial position in our consolidated financial statements 
during  we were approached with two offers to buy our mcallen heart hospital  in which we owned a interest 
on march   the hospital was sold to an affiliate of universal health services  inc for approximately million 
approximately million of the sale proceeds were used to repay the hospital s long term debt  including intercompany debt 
the net proceeds of the sale have been and will be distributed to the owners of the hospital based on their respective ownership percentages 
hospitals under development are typically capitalized with a mix of debt and equity 
equity represents approximately to of our new hospital s anticipated development costs  which include real estate acquisition  construction costs  equipment purchases and pre opening expenses  with debt accounting for the remainder of the project costs 
commercial banks or real estate investment trusts typically provide financing to fund a portion of a hospital s real estate acquisition  construction and related costs  while lenders affiliated with our equipment vendors typically provide debt financing for a hospital s equipment needs 
new hospital development on october   we opened our newest hospital in harlingen  texas 
this hospital  which represents our ninth hospital in operation  focuses on cardiovascular care as well as orthopedics  neurology  obstetrics and gynecology 
as of december   we had four hospitals under development  including a heart hospital that will be located in st 
tammany parish just north of new orleans  louisiana  a heart hospital that will be located in san antonio  texas  a heart hospital that will be located in the city of glendale  near milwaukee  wisconsin  and a heart hospital that will be located in lafayette  louisiana 
these four new hospitals are expected to open during march st 
tammany parish  the late summer of san antonio  and the fall of glendale and lafayette 
once a new hospital venture is formed and the partners have contributed their capital  it typically takes approximately to months to develop the heart hospital 
the development costs for our five most recently opened hospitals  including the cost of equipment and capitalized construction period interest  have ranged from million to million depending on the size of the hospital and its location 
these costs were incurred throughout the construction period  with approximately of the costs being incurred in the last six months before opening the hospital 
in addition  we incur pre opening expenses throughout the development process  with the majority of these expenses incurred during the six to eight month period immediately prior to opening the heart hospital 
pre opening expenses for our five most recently opened hospitals have ranged between million and million per hospital 
approximately of these pre opening expenses were for personnel and for marketing and advertising 
the balance was distributed among several categories including staff recruitment and relocation  office and equipment rentals  travel and meals for the staff and other operating expenses such as property taxes  legal expenses  insurance and utilities 
we expect to begin development on between one and three new heart hospitals each year 
sources of revenue by division the largest percentage of our net revenue is attributable to our hospital division  which reflects our continuing strategic focus and investment in new hospitals 
based on our continued investment in the development of hospitals  we believe our hospital division s percentage of consolidated net revenue will continue to increase in future periods 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each of our consolidating divisions to consolidated net revenue in the periods indicated  on a pro forma basis to reflect the sale of our mcallen heart hospital and the consolidation of the tucson heart hospital resulting from the transactions discussed above 
pro forma year ended september  division hospital diagnostic services corporate and other net revenue sources of revenue by payor we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations  and our patients directly 
generally  our net revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payor mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
since cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects older people  the proportion of net revenue we derive from the medicare program is higher than that of most general acute care hospitals 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our hospital division s net revenue we earned by category of payor in each of our last three fiscal years 
hospital year ended september  division medicare and medicaid commercial and other total hospital division net revenue payments we receive from the medicare and medicaid programs for services rendered to patients also comprise a significant part of our total net revenue 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenue we earned by category of payor in our last three fiscal years 
consolidated year ended september  division medicare and medicaid commercial and other total consolidated net revenue we expect the net revenue that we receive from the medicare program as a percentage of total consolidated net revenue to increase in future periods because the percentage of our total consolidated net revenue generated by our hospital division will continue to increase as we open new hospitals 
other factors that will cause the percentage of our hospital division s net revenue received from medicare to increase include our focus on cardiovascular disease  which disproportionately affects older people  the general aging of the population and the restoration of some payments under the balanced budget refinement act of and the benefits improvement and protection act of the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  which correlates to the physician s diagnosis of the patient s illness 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
a reduced rate of increase in medicare payments may have an adverse impact on our net revenue 
the payments we receive under the medicare program also include outlier payments for patients with higher than average costs 
we are also reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies  such as fee for service charges and rates based on diagnosis related groups  or drgs 
we limit the number of per diem contracts we accept from managed care organizations because we believe these contracts do not reimburse us sufficiently for the efficiencies that we achieve in our hospitals 
we do not accept capitation contracts from any payors 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes as experience develops or new information becomes known 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine and have the potential to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid and other third party payors such as commercial insurers and health maintenance organizations are generally less than our established billing rates 
payment arrangements with third party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge or per visit  a discount from established charges  per diem payments  reimbursed costs subject to limits and or other similar contractual arrangements 
as a result  net revenue for services rendered to patients is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts as services are rendered 
we account for the difference between the estimated realizable rates under the reimbursement program and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which are accrued on an estimated basis in the period that the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known and final settlements are determined 
estimates of contractual adjustments are made on a payor specific basis and based on the best information available regarding our interpretation of the applicable laws  regulations and contract terms 
we continually review the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to the laws and regulations and any changes in the contractual terms of our programs 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties  which can take several years to determine the final amounts earned under the programs 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings as contractual adjustments in the periods that such adjustments become known or as the service years are no longer subject to audit  review or investigation 
due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
management fee revenue in our diagnostic services division is recognized under fixed rate and percentage of income contractual arrangements as services are rendered 
in some cases  this division also recognizes management fee revenue under cost reimbursement and equipment lease contractual arrangements 
our cardiology consulting and management operations  which is included in our corporate and other division  recognizes management fee revenue under various percentage of income and cost reimbursement contractual arrangements and consulting and other revenue under service contractual arrangements 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients in our hospital division 
the remainder of our accounts receivable generally consist of amounts due from billings to hospitals for various cardiovascular care services performed in our diagnostics division and amounts due under consulting and management contracts in our cardiology consulting and management division 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on such factors as payor mix  aging and the historical collection experience and write offs of our respective hospitals and other business units 
within our hospital division  which comprised of our accounts receivable at september   we rely on periodic detailed reviews of historical collections and write offs at each of our hospitals to estimate this allowance 
adverse changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care reimbursement could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
general and professional liability risk due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the general and professional liability insurance markets  the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly 
as a result  we expect our total insurance premiums  including professional and general liability  property  business  auto  directors and officers  workers compensation and other coverages to increase approximately million for our fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  we expect to assume a greater portion of the risk  through self insured retention and higher deductibles  under our new commercial insurance policies during fiscal than in prior fiscal years 
on june   our three year combined insurance policy that provided medical malpractice claims coverage on a claims made  first dollar basis expired  and we became partially self insured under a one year policy providing coverage for claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim 
at the same time  to provide coverage for claims incurred prior to june   but not reported as of that date under the expired claims made policy  we purchased tail insurance coverage  the full cost of which we were required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to recognize as an operating expense in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of increasing premiums for malpractice insurance during fiscal  the increase we paid for our new policy compared to the premiums we paid for the old policy was significant 
because we have retained up to million of liability per claim under the new policy  we are required to recognize up to the first million of estimated expense liability for each malpractice claim incurred under the new policy period beginning june  as of september   our total estimated liability for its self insured retention on medical malpractice claims  including incurred but not reported claims  was  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain this reserve based on actuarial estimates by an independent third party  who based the estimates on our historical experience with claims and assumptions about future events 
the actuarial determined estimate of the costs of the self insured retention for the current one year policy period through may  has been determined to be approximately million for our consolidated operating entities 
in addition to reserves for medical malpractice  we also maintain reserves for our self insured healthcare and dental coverage provided to our employees 
as of september   our total estimated reserve for self insured liabilities on employee health and dental claims was million  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we also maintain commercial stop loss coverage for our health and dental insurance program of  per plan participant 
we maintain this reserve based on our historical experience with claims 
we continually review our estimates for self insured liabilities and record adjustments as experience develops or new information becomes known 
the changes to the estimated liabilities are included in current operating results 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  including such factors as changes in medical costs and changes in actual experience  there is a reasonable possibility that the recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
also  there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
we expect both the premium costs and the self insured retention under our various general and professional liability risk programs will increase our other operating expenses during the next twelve months 
as we open new hospitals and diagnostic and therapeutic centers  we also expect to incur additional premium costs and self insured retention costs to reflect the additional risk exposure 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable 
we continually consider internal and external factors such as hospital and physician contract changes  local market developments  changes in third party reimbursement methodologies  national health care trends  and other publicly available information 
measurement of the amount of the impairment  if any  may be based on quoted market prices  if available  or an estimate based on valuation techniques available in the circumstances  including discounted cash flows using our cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections that we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
as considerable judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows and fair values  there is a reasonable possibility that actual results may vary significantly from such estimates 
goodwill goodwill arising from business combinations completed after june  is accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
also effective october   the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
accordingly  we do not amortize goodwill  but rather we subject our goodwill to an annual test at september for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we will also test goodwill of our reporting units between annual tests if an event occurs  or circumstances change  that indicate an impairment may exist 
our reporting units with goodwill include our hospital division and our diagnostics division 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting units principally using multiples of earnings valuation methods as of september   which did not result in any impairment loss when compared to the carrying amounts of our reporting units 
earnings allocated to minority interests earnings allocated to minority interests represent the allocation of profits and losses to minority owners in our consolidated subsidiaries 
with respect to our consolidated hospitals  each hospital s profits and losses are generally allocated for accounting purposes to us and our minority partners on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective ownership percentages 
however if the cumulative losses of a hospital exceed its initial capitalization and committed capital obligations of our partners  then we are required  due to the respective at risk capital positions  by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to recognize a disproportionate share of the hospital s losses that otherwise would be allocated to all owners on a pro rata basis 
in such cases  we will then recognize a disproportionate share of the hospital s future profits to the extent we have previously recognized a disproportionate share of the hospital s losses 
the determination of at risk capital position is based on the specific terms of each hospital s operating agreement  including each partners contributed capital  obligation to provide working capital loans  to contribute additional capital  or to guarantee the outstanding obligations of the hospital 
during each of our last three fiscal years ended september    and  our reported earnings losses allocated to minority interests of million  million and million  respectively  would have been million  million and million had we not recognized disproportionate allocations as described above 
therefore  for the fiscal years ended september   and our reported income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of million  million and million  respectively  would have been million  million and million 
we expect our earnings allocated to minority interests to fluctuate in future periods as we either recognize disproportionate losses and or recoveries thereof through disproportionate profits of our hospitals 
as of september   we had remaining cumulative disproportionate loss allocations of approximately million that we may recover in future periods  or be required to recognize additional disproportionate losses  depending on the results of operations of each of our hospitals 
we could also be required to recognize disproportionate losses at our other hospitals not currently in disproportionate allocation depending on their results of operations in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are provided for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or for that future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  our effective income tax rate was  which was below our statutory rate of due primarily to the reversal of valuation allowances we had recorded to fully offset our net deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal in future periods we expect our effective income tax rate  and related income tax expense or benefit  to increase and more closely approximate our statutory rate 
in addition  the amount of current income tax liability we will have in future periods may be offset by million and million of gross federal and state  respectively  net operating loss carryforwards from prior periods we have available as of september  results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
this information has been derived from the consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this report 
year ended september  net revenue operating expenses personnel expense medical supplies expense bad debt expense other operating expenses depreciation amortization loss gain on disposal of property and equipment gain on sale of hospital impairment of long lived assets income from operations other income expenses interest expense interest income other income expense  net equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates income loss before minority interest and income taxes and extraordinary item minority interest income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax benefit expense year ended september  income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income loss year ended september  compared to year ended september  net revenue increased million  or  to million in our fiscal year ended september  from million in our fiscal year ended september  of the million increase in net revenue  our hospital division generated a million increase and our diagnostic services division generated an million increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our corporate and other division which includes our cardiology consulting and management operations 
the million increase in our hospital division s net revenue includes the effect of four events 
in march  we sold our mcallen heart hospital  in july  we began consolidating the financial results of our tucson heart hospital  and on october   we began consolidating the financial results of our heart hospital of new mexico 
these three events in our hospital division combined for a net increase of million in net revenue during fiscal from fiscal lastly  in june  one of our hospitals reached a favorable settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider  which resulted in that hospital recognizing an additional million of net revenue for fiscal the remaining million increase in our hospital division s net revenue was primarily attributable to a increase in adjusted admissions and a increase in revenue per adjusted admission 
the million increase in our diagnostic services division includes the effect of two events 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we received an arbitration award involving a billing dispute with our hospital joint venture partner in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers  which increased net revenue for fiscal by million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million increase in net revenue from management fees resulting from the favorable settlement of a billing dispute between one of our managed diagnostic centers  sun city cardiac center  and sun health corporation  which owns and operates the hospital where the center is located 
under the terms of the settlement  sun city cardiac center was awarded total proceeds of million relating to service fees  attorney fees and interest costs owed during the period of the contractual dispute 
we own a interest in sun city cardiac associates  which manages sun city cardiac center and receives management fees for performing such services 
excluding the effect of these two events  our diagnostic services division generated a million increase in net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal this million increase was primarily due to rate increases over the prior year  including those resulting from a new services agreement executed with the sun city cardiac center  an increase in the number of diagnostic procedures over the prior year in several of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers  and to the opening of three new diagnostic and therapeutic centers during the second quarter of fiscal these increases in net revenue were partially offset by a decrease attributable to the curtailment of procedures in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers that we elected to close in october due to the center s results of operations not meeting our long term strategic objectives 
the million decrease in our corporate and other division s net revenue was due to the settlement and expiration of one management contract during the third quarter of fiscal and another management contract during the first quarter of fiscal  offset in part by an increase in management fees and consulting fees we received from physicians remaining under management in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
on a same facility basis in our hospital division  which includes tucson heart hospital and excludes heart hospital of new mexico and mcallen heart hospital  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal admissions decreased and adjusted admission declined 
these operating measures reflect the impact of certain events at two of our hospitals 
the first was our decision to convert the emergency department to a chest pain clinic at bakersfield heart hospital 
the primary reason we converted the emergency department to a chest pain clinic was in response to a payment dispute with a large managed care provider in that market 
as we anticipated at the time of the conversion  the hospital experienced a decline in overall admissions after the conversion 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we reached a favorable settlement with the managed care provider 
as a result of this settlement and other factors  we have been evaluating whether to reopen the emergency department provided it would not detract us from our primary mission of providing quality cardiovascular care 
in december  bakersfield heart hospital s board of directors approved such a plan to reopen the emergency department  and we are currently pursuing the steps necessary to reopen the emergency department  including obtaining the required regulatory approvals 
the second event affecting our same facility operating measures was our decision to terminate several managed care relationships  primarily associated with our tucson heart hospital  that we determined no longer met our long term strategic objectives 
the final event impacting our same facility operating measures was a reduction in available beds during the fourth quarter of fiscal at two of our hospitals due to renovations and repairs being performed at these facilities 
these renovations resulted in fewer beds being available at these two hospitals during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal of these beds  beds are currently back in service and the other beds are expected to be back in service by the end of january also on a same facility basis  inpatient catheterization procedures increased while inpatient surgical procedures decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal average length of stay in our same facility hospitals decreased to days for fiscal compared to days for fiscal personnel expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the million increase was primarily incurred by our hospital division and included million that was attributable to the net increase resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of our mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining increase of million was primarily due to higher wage rates and benefit costs at our other hospitals  and an increase in use of contract nurses in certain of our hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  personnel expense represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostic services division  personnel expense represented of net revenue for fiscal medical supplies expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase was primarily incurred by our hospital division  and included a net increase of million resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining increase of  in our other hospitals was primarily due to the increased number of procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by the improved pricing realized from volume purchasing opportunities and vendor consolidation initiatives in our hospital division 
as a percentage of net revenue  medical supplies expense decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  medical supplies expense represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostic services division  medical supplies expense represented of net revenue for fiscal we expect our medical supplies expense to increase as new technologies  such as drug eluting stents  are introduced into the cardiovascular care market 
the amount of increase in our medical supplies expense  and the relationship to net revenue  in future periods will depend on many factors such as the introduction  availability  cost and utilization of the specific new technology by physicians in providing patient care  as well as any changes in reimbursement amounts we may receive from medicare and other payors 
bad debt expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in bad debt expense was due to a million net increase resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
this million increase was partially offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense at our other hospitals 
as of september   the end of our fiscal year  our hospital division s days of net revenue in accounts receivable were days compared to days as of september  we attribute this decline in days and the decrease in our same facility hospitals bad debt expense to improved receivables collection procedures and other processes we have implemented in our business offices and the decline in aged receivables resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement 
as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  bad debt expense represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostic services division  bad debt expense represented of net revenue for fiscal other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal other operating expenses include primarily maintenance  rent  property taxes  insurance  utilities  advertising  travel  professional fees  contract services and support services provided to operating divisions by our corporate office 
of the million increase in other operating expenses  million occurred within our hospital division  of which million was due to the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining million increase in our hospital division s other operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in the medical malpractice insurance costs of our other hospitals resulting from the change in our insurance program during the third quarter of fiscal see discussion found under the caption  critical accounting policies 
also contributing to this remaining increase in other operating expense was an increase in maintenance expense in our oldest hospital  an increase in property taxes in certain of our markets  and an increase in unreimbursed costs  primarily legal expense  incurred in connection with the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in sales and use and gross receipts taxes in one of our heart hospitals resulting from a favorable ruling by the state taxing authority in which that heart hospital operates that this hospital was exempt from the related taxes 
the diagnostic services division s other operating expenses increased  due to the combined effect of the increased costs of medical malpractice coverage  as previously discussed  in that division and the net revenue growth in its operations  offset in part by cost reductions from exiting certain low margin services in that division 
the remaining million increase in other operating expenses occurred in our corporate and other division  and was due to an increase in our corporate expenses to support the growth in our operating divisions for fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in the expenses of our cardiology consulting and management operations consistent with its decline in operations for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  other operating expenses represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostic services division  other operating expenses represented of net revenue for fiscal pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal pre opening expenses represent expenses specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
as of september   we had five hospitals under development  including harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital  heart hospital of san antonio  the heart hospital of milwaukee and heart hospital of lafayette 
on october   we opened the harlingen medical center 
the other four new hospitals are expected to open during march louisiana  late summer of san antonio and the fall of milwaukee and lafayette 
we expect pre opening expenses for each of these four hospitals will range between approximately million and million per hospital 
historically based on our five most recently developed consolidated hospitals  approximately of our pre opening expenses for a new hospital have been for personnel and for marketing and advertising 
the remaining costs have been distributed among several categories including staff recruitment and relocation  office and equipment rentals  travel and other operating expenses such as legal expense and utilities 
while we incur pre opening expenses throughout the development process  we expect to incur the majority of these expenses during the six to eight month period immediately prior to the opening of the hospital 
we expect pre opening expenses to increase for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in development activity related to the four hospitals currently under development and others that we may begin to develop during the next fiscal year 
depreciation increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal of this million increase  million was due to the net increase resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining increase was primarily due to depreciation on capital expenditures related to equipment and information systems made since fiscal we expect depreciation expenses to increase for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the opening of harlingen medical center in october and the scheduled openings between march and the fall of of our other hospitals currently under development 
amortization decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to our adoption of sfas no 
on october  under the new accounting rules  we were required to discontinue goodwill amortization at the beginning of our fiscal and subject our goodwill to an annual impairment test  which was performed on a transitional basis as of october  and on a recurring annual basis as of september   and which did not result in any impairment losses 
for fiscal  we recognized goodwill amortization of approximately million 
the remaining decrease in amortization occurred in our corporate and other division and was due to the impairment of other intangible assets recognized in the second quarter of fiscal see discussion under fiscal compared to fiscal  and the write off of other intangible assets in connection with the settlement and expiration of another management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations during the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recognized approximately million gain on the partial settlement of a cardiology management contract that occurred in december this gain is included in gain on sale of property  equipment and other asserts in our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease in interest expense occurred despite a million net increase in interest expense resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the decrease in interest expense excluding the effect of these three events was due to a general reduction in our variable rate interest costs and a reduction in our average total outstanding indebtedness during fiscal compared to fiscal the debt reduction was primarily due to the use of proceeds from the sale of mcallen heart hospital in march and our initial public offering in july to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
also in july  three of our hospitals reduced their interest expense by refinancing approximately million of their mortgage debt 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which was primarily due to the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico 
upon consolidation of each of these hospitals  we were required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to begin eliminating interest income in our corporate division on working capital advances outstanding to these hospitals 
we expect the total amount of our outstanding indebtedness will increase in future periods as a result of the debt we will incur to finance the development of additional hospitals  including those currently under development 
accordingly  we expect our interest expense to increase consistent with the increase in indebtedness and changes in market interest rates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million  or  to million for fiscal from a loss of million for fiscal equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates represents our share of the net earnings of hospitals in which we own less than a equity interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control 
in july  we began consolidating the financial results of our tucson heart hospital  and in october  we began consolidating the financial results of our heart hospital of new mexico after completing acquisitions that increased our ownership interests in each of these hospitals to a majority position 
we had previously been required to account for our minority investment in each of these hospitals using the equity method of accounting 
we now have only one hospital in which we hold less than an equity interest that we are required to account for as an equity investment during fiscal this heart hospital commenced operations in march we also continue to hold a small number of additional equity investments  primarily in our diagnostic services division 
earnings allocated to minority interests decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the million decrease in earnings allocated to minority interests includes the effect of million recognized in the second quarter of fiscal resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital  million recognized in the third quarter of fiscal resulting from the amounts we received in the arbitration award involving a billing dispute with our hospital joint venture partner in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers  and the million recognized in the second quarter of fiscal resulting from the sun city cardiac settlement 
excluding these three events  earnings allocated to minority interests increased approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal of this million increase  million was due to the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and heart hospital of new mexico  as previously discussed 
the remaining  increase was due to improved operating results in our other consolidated hospitals and improved operating results in certain joint ventures in our diagnostic services division  offset in part by the increase in pre opening expenses for hospitals under development 
income tax expense increased to million for fiscal from  for fiscal during fiscal  we had net deferred tax assets  primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards that were fully offset by valuation allowances 
these offset net deferred tax assets also included the deferred tax asset related to our minority equity investment in our one remaining unconsolidated affiliate hospital 
during fiscal  we determined all of our valuation allowances were no longer required and reversed the allowances in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as a result of generating income before income taxes of million during fiscal and the reversal of all of our valuation allowances  we recognized million of deferred income tax expense along with  of current income tax expense during fiscal because we continue to have net operating loss carryforwards available from prior periods  we have no material current income tax liability 
in future periods we expect our effective income tax rate  and related income tax expense or benefit  to increase to more closely approximate our statutory rate 
in addition  the amount of current income tax liability we will have in future periods may be offset by million and million of federal and state  respectively  net operating loss carryforwards from prior periods we have available as of september  year ended september  compared to year ended september  net revenue increased million  or  to million in our fiscal year ended september  from million in our fiscal year ended september  of the million increase in net revenue  million was generated by our hospital division  million by our diagnostics division and million by corporate and other division  which includes our cardiology consulting and management operations 
the million increase in our hospital division s net revenue includes the effect of certain events that occurred in only one of the two fiscal years 
in march  we sold our mcallen heart hospital  which resulted in a million decrease in net revenue  and in july we began consolidating our tucson heart hospital upon our acquiring a majority ownership interest  which resulted in an million increase in net revenue 
in fiscal  we recognized a million favorable settlement of an insurance claim and a million unfavorable change in reimbursement from one of our primary payors 
adjusted for these events  the increase in the hospital division s net revenue in fiscal was million  which was primarily due to an increase in number of procedures performed in our hospitals 
of this million increase  million was generated in our hospitals that had been open for more than months as of september   including one that opened near the end of fiscal  and million was generated by one hospital that opened near the beginning of fiscal of the million increase in net revenue in our diagnostics division  million was due to amounts we received from an arbitration award involving a billing dispute with our hospital joint venture partner in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers 
the remaining million was due to an increase in diagnostic procedures over the prior fiscal year 
the million increase in net revenue in our corporate and other division was primarily due to an increase in management fees and consulting fees paid to us by physicians under management in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
personnel expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in personnel expense was primarily incurred by our hospital division 
of the million increase  million was due to one hospital that opened near the beginning of fiscal this new hospital experienced a significant increase in the number of procedures performed in fiscal  and consequently  the staffing requirements during fiscal were considerably higher than during fiscal another million of the increase in our hospital division was due to the consolidation of our tucson heart hospital beginning in july lastly  another million of the increase in our hospital division was due to a higher number of procedures performed at our hospitals that had been open for more than months as of september  and higher wage rates and benefit costs  offset in part by the decrease in personnel expense resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital on march  as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal medical supplies expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal of the million increase in medical supplies expense  million was incurred by our hospital division 
of this million increase in our hospital division  million was due to one hospital that opened near the beginning of fiscal this new hospital experienced a significant increase in the number of procedures performed between fiscal and fiscal  and consequently  the volume of medical supplies used was higher during fiscal another million of the increase in our hospital division was due to the consolidation of our tucson heart hospital beginning in july the remaining million increase in our hospital division was due to a higher number of procedures performed at our hospitals that had been open for more than months as of september  and an increased level of unreimbursed research activities in one of our hospitals  offset in part by the decrease in medical supplies expense resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital on march  the remaining  increase in medical supplies expense was in our diagnostic services division due to an increase in diagnostic procedures performed during fiscal compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of net revenue  medical supplies expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to improved pricing realized from volume purchasing opportunities 
bad debt expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal of this million increase in bad debt expense  million was due to one hospital that opened near the beginning of fiscal and another  was due to the consolidation of our tucson heart hospital beginning in july bad debt expense increased approximately million at our hospitals that had been open for more than months as of september  this increase in same facility hospitals was due to the growth in net revenue in those hospitals  offset in part by the million decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital on march  as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal our hospital division incurred a million increase in other operating expenses  of which million was due to one hospital that opened near the beginning of fiscal and another million resulted from the consolidation of our tucson heart hospital beginning in july the remaining million increase in our hospital division was primarily due to an increase in property taxes and utility costs in certain of our markets and an increase in contract services and other expenses related to several business office initiatives in our hospitals that had been open for more than months as of september   offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of the mcallen heart hospital on march  our diagnostic services and corporate and other divisions also incurred increases in other operating expenses consistent with the net revenue growth in their operations 
as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from  for fiscal pre opening expenses represent expenses specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
as of september   we had three hospitals under development  including harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital and heart hospital of san antonio 
as of september   we only had one hospital under development  harlingen medical center 
depreciation and amortization remained constant at million in fiscal and depreciation expense decreased slightly by  while amortization increased by  for fiscal compared to fiscal the decreases in depreciation resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital on march  more than offset the increase resulting from the consolidation of tucson heart hospital beginning in july  and the increase in depreciation on capital expenditures related to equipment and information systems made during fiscal similarly  the decrease in amortization resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital nearly offset an increase in the amortization of a practice management contract during fiscal to reflect a reduction in its estimated economic life 
on march   mcallen heart hospital  in which we owned a interest  was sold to an affiliate of universal health services  inc for approximately million 
approximately million of the sale proceeds were used to repay the hospital s long term debt  including intercompany amounts paid to us  which we then used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
after the write off of approximately million of our goodwill and step up basis in mcallen heart hospital  which arose from our going private transaction in fiscal  we recognized a net gain of million in our consolidated results of operations for fiscal approximately million was recognized in earnings allocated to minority interests as a result of the sale 
this minority interest amount was determined before the write off of our goodwill and step up basis and after the allocation of amounts to us for recovery of disproportionate losses of mcallen heart hospital  which we had previously recognized in our consolidated results of operations 
in march  we recognized an impairment of long lived assets due to unfavorable developments with a physician group under a management contract that caused us to reevaluate the carrying value of the assets of that management contract 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of  in march to adjust the long lived assets of that management contract to the anticipated future discounted cash flows 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in interest expense was due to a general reduction in our variable rate interest costs due to declining market rates and a reduction in our average total outstanding indebtedness during fiscal compared to fiscal the debt reduction was primarily due to several significant transactions during fiscal first  we reduced our debt in march as a result of the sale of mcallen heart hospital and the use of our portion of the net proceeds from that sale  along with cash provided by our other operations  to pay down debt under our revolving credit facility 
second  we used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in july to repay all remaining amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
third  in july three of our hospitals reduced their interest costs by refinancing approximately million of their existing mortgage indebtedness with new mortgage debt under our new million credit facility 
interest income increased slightly by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to an increase in short term investments resulting from the temporary investment of the remaining proceeds from the initial public offering in july  offset by the decline in the market rates on short term investments in fiscal compared to fiscal equity in net losses of unconsolidated affiliates remained relatively consistent at million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal 
in july  we began consolidating our tucson heart hospital upon increase of our ownership interest to a majority position 
we had previously been required to account for our investment in tucson heart hospital using the equity method of accounting 
also  effective october  the first day of our fiscal we increased our ownership in the heart hospital of new mexico from a minority to a majority ownership position and obtained substantive control of that hospital  and consequently  we will begin consolidating that hospital for our fiscal as a result of these transactions  we currently have only one hospital in which we hold less than a equity interest that we will continue to account for as an equity investment during our fiscal  along with certain equity investments in our diagnostic services division 
earnings allocated to minority interests increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal of the million increase in earnings allocated to minority interests  million was due to improved operating results in two of our consolidated hospitals  offset in part by a decrease in the earnings of one of our other consolidated hospitals and pre opening expenses at our hospitals under development 
the remaining million increase was due to the allocation of the gain on the sale of mcallen heart hospital to the minority owners  and the allocation to the minority owners of the income from the amounts we received in an arbitration award involving a billing dispute with our hospital joint venture partner in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers 
income tax expense increased slightly due to state taxes in one of our markets in fiscal in july  three of our hospitals refinanced a portion of their indebtedness by borrowing million under our new credit facility to fund the repayment of million of outstanding principal under their existing credit arrangements   of prepayment penalty  and million of debt issuance costs 
as a result of the prepayment penalty and unamortized debt issue costs on the existing indebtedness  we recognized an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt of  net of minority interest and income taxes 
selected quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly consolidated operating results for each of our last five quarters 
we have prepared this information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and included all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
these quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
three months ended september  june  march  december  september  statement of operations data net revenue income from operations equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates minority interest net income loss cash flow and other data net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities ebitda ebitda  before pre opening expenses our results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
cardiovascular procedures can often be scheduled ahead of time  permitting some patients to choose to undergo the procedure at a time and location of their preference 
some of the types of trends that we have experienced in the past and may experience again in the future include the markets where some of our hospitals are located are susceptible to seasonal population changes with part time residents living in the area only during certain months of the year  patients choosing to schedule procedures around significant dates  such as holidays  and physicians in the market where a hospital is located schedule vacation from their practice during the summer months of the year  around holidays and for various professional meetings held throughout the world during the year 
to the extent these types of events occur in the future  as in the past  we expect they will affect the quarterly results of operations of our hospitals 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow activities our consolidated working capital was million at september  and million at september  the decrease of million in working capital resulted primarily from increases in accrued construction and development costs  short term borrowings  accounts payable  accrued compensation and current portion of long term debt  offset in part by increases in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  net  medical supplies  deferred tax assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets combined with a decrease in accrued property taxes and other accrued liabilities 
the increase in accrued construction and development costs resulted from increased construction activity at our hospitals under development and accrued purchases of medical equipment that was received by harlingen medical center but not yet invoiced by the vendor  and therefore not funded by long term debt  as of september  the increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits primarily resulted from the consolidation of heart hospital of new mexico in fiscal beginning october  and an increase in personnel at harlingen medical center in preparation for the hospital opening on october  the increase in the short term borrowings was due to a working capital loan at heart hospital of new mexico to fund operations 
the increase in current portion of long term debt was also primarily due to the consolidation of heart hospital of new mexico 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from cash flows provided by operations  proceeds from the favorable settlement of the sun city cardiac center billing dispute  proceeds from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  offset in part by cash used to acquire the increased ownership interest in heart hospital of new mexico 
the increase in accounts receivable  net  resulted from the consolidation of heart hospital of new mexico in fiscal  and growth in our net revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to fiscal offset in part by increased collections in our hospital division 
medical supplies inventory also increased as a result of the consolidation of heart hospital of new mexico in fiscal and volume purchases of inventory at several of our hospitals near the end of fiscal the increase in deferred tax assets was due to the reversal of our valuation allowances  which fully offset our deferred tax assets at september   and the recognition of deferred tax assets during fiscal year the increase in prepaid expense and other current assets was primarily due to the increase in premiums we paid for our new medical malpractice insurance our operating activities provided net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash of million for fiscal the million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was the result of cash flow provided by our operations  which increased significantly for fiscal compared to fiscal  and the net increase in our working capital components as discussed above excluding the increase of million in accrued construction and development costs which is a non cash activity 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was the result of cash flow provided by our operations and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities offset by an increase in accounts receivable  net  medical supplies inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
our investing activities used net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash provided of million for fiscal the million of net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to our capital expenditures for hospitals under development  our acquisition of the increased ownership in heart hospital of new mexico  and our acquisition of a nuclear management company in our diagnostic division  partially offset by a decrease in advances made to our unconsolidated affiliate hospital and proceeds from the settlement of a cardiology management contract during fiscal the million of net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of mcallen heart hospital in march  offset in part by our acquisition of an increased ownership in five of our hospitals in connection with our initial public offering july  our capital expenditures primarily related to our hospitals under development  and advances made to our unconsolidated affiliate hospitals during fiscal we expect to continue to invest cash in our hospital development program in future periods 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash of million for fiscal the million of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of short term debt and long term debt  net of loan acquisition costs of million  offset in part by repayments of long term debt and capital leasing obligation of million and distributions to  net of investments by  minority partners of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was the result of the net proceeds from our initial public offering of million combined with proceeds from issuance of short term and long term debt  net of loan acquisition costs of million  offset in part by repayments of short term debt  long term debt and capital leasing obligations of million  distributions to  net of investments by  minority partners of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  we expect to continue to obtain capital principally through proceeds from issuance of long term debt related to our hospital development program 
capital expenditures expenditures for property and equipment for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
included in the million of capital expenditures for fiscal were capital expenditures of million for our hospitals under development 
included in the million of capital expenditures for fiscal were capital expenditures of million for our hospitals under development 
in addition to our capital expenditures funded from cash flows  we funded million and million of capital expenditures for equipment during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  by incurring capital lease obligations 
we also accrued million and million of capital expenditures for construction and development costs related to our hospitals under develop during fiscal and  respectively 
we expect our capital expenditures for our hospitals under development will increase for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in development activity related to the four hospitals currently under development and others that we may begin to develop during the next fiscal year 
in addition  we expect to incur significant capital expenditure as long as we develop new hospitals 
obligations  commitments and availability of financing as described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we had certain cash obligations at september   which are due as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt obligations under capital leases total debt other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps operating leases  net of rental income total other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps  consists of a working capital note due to a hospital investor partner at one of our hospitals 
the obligation is due as funds are available and therefore is included in the thereafter category in the above table 
at september   we had million of outstanding debt  million of which was classified as current 
of the million of outstanding debt  million was outstanding to lenders to our hospitals and million was outstanding under capital leases and other miscellaneous indebtedness 
no amounts were outstanding to lenders under our million revolving credit facility at september   however  we had letters of credit issued of million  which reduced our availability for additional borrowings to million under the facility 
in addition to the debt and cash obligations set forth above  we expect to incur additional indebtedness during fiscal and future periods as we develop new hospitals 
the development and construction of the four hospitals currently under development in texas  louisiana and wisconsin will require us to incur additional long term debt of between million and million during the next to months 
we expect approximately million of this additional long term debt will be mortgage debt  of which approximately million is available from designated  but unused  commitments and remaining undesignated borrowings available under the master credit facility as of september  we intend to finance the remaining million of mortgage debt through other long term borrowings under terms similar to our master credit facility 
we expect the remaining million of additional long term debt will be equipment debt primarily financed through a combination of debt and capital leases provided by lenders affiliated with the equipment vendors 
we became a party to a new million master credit facility in july in connection with our initial public offering 
in addition to providing a source of capital to refinance approximately million of the indebtedness of three of our existing hospitals  the master credit facility provided us with million to finance the construction and development of new hospitals under our hospital development program 
as of september   million of the initial million had been designated  of which million had been borrowed to finance the development of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital 
in november  an additional million was designated for use in funding the development of heart hospital of san antonio 
the remaining million is available to finance other projects in our hospital development program 
the master credit facility matures on july  and borrowings bear interest at libor plus a margin that ranges to 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee each month at a rate of 
the master credit facility includes covenants that require maintenance of certain financial ratios regarding leverage levels and debt service coverage as well as various restrictive covenants 
also in may  harlingen medical center obtained a new debt commitment to finance its equipment 
this new debt commitment allows the hospital to borrow up to million until april  during this time  interest will accrue at the prime rate plus basis points 
after such date  amounts funded under the loan shall accrue interest at a fixed rate of interest equal to a specific treasury note yield  plus a margin 
upon the conversion of the loan to a fixed rate of interest  the principal amount outstanding will be repaid over a time period equal to either five or seven years  depending on the type and manufacturer of equipment originally purchased under the facility 
as of september   harlingen medical center had borrowed million of the million available 
as of september   we were committed under construction contracts for our hospitals under development and had paid and accrued amounts under such contracts as follows in millions amount amount amount committed paid accrued harlingen medical center louisiana heart hospital heart hospital of san antonio the heart hospital of milwaukee separate from our master credit facility as discussed above  our revolving credit facility provides million in availability  million of which is designated for short term borrowings and million of which is available to issue letters of credit 
as of september   we had used million of this availability to issue letters of credit and consequently had availability for additional borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures on january  and borrowings under the facility bear interest at either the libor or the prime rate plus various applicable margins that are based upon financial covenant ratio tests 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee each month at a rate of 
the revolving credit facility includes various restrictive covenants  including restrictions on certain types of additional indebtedness  investments  asset sales  capital expenditures  dividends  sale and leasebacks  contingent obligations  transactions with affiliates  changes in our corporate structure  and fundamental changes 
the covenants also require maintenance of various ratios regarding leverage levels and debt service coverage 
we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our outstanding debt at september   with the exception of certain financial ratio covenants related to the mortgage loan at one of our hospitals and the reit loan at another of our hospitals 
the mortgage lender granted a waiver for the breach of that hospital s financial ratio covenants at september  and agreed to amend the financial ratios through june   at which time the financial ratio covenant reverts to the original terms of the loan 
we are currently seeking a waiver of the specific financial covenant from the reit lender at our other hospital  and we have the ability to refinance the hospital s debt within the next twelve months 
we guarantee either all or a portion of the obligations of our hospital subsidiaries for bank mortgage loans 
we also guarantee a portion of the obligations of our hospital subsidiaries for equipment and other notes payable 
we receive a fee for providing these guarantees from the hospitals or the physician investors 
we also guarantee approximately of the real estate and equipment debt of heart hospital of south dakota  the one hospital in which we owned a minority interest at september   and therefore do not consolidate the hospital s results of operation and financial position 
we provide such guarantee in exchange for a fee from the hospital 
the total amount of this real estate and equipment debt was approximately million at september   and accordingly  the we guarantee was approximately million 
the hospital was in compliance with all covenants in the instruments governing its debt at september  the total amount of this hospital s debt is secured by the hospital s underlying real estate and equipment  which were financed with the proceeds from the debt 
because we do not consolidate heart hospital of south dakota s results of operations and financial position  neither these assets nor the accompanying liabilities are included in the value of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million  together with the remaining net proceeds of our initial public offering of million  borrowings available under the master credit facility not yet designated for a development hospital of million  borrowings available under equipment debt commitments of million  cash balances in our development hospitals of million  and other long term debt and capital leases we expect to incur will be sufficient to finance our hospital development program  other capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next to months 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing changes in reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs that will continue to limit payments we receive under these programs 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to legislative and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments may  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of our hospitals or require other changes in our operations 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages  such as the growing nationwide shortage of qualified nurses  occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have to date offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services and expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover  or offset  future cost increases
