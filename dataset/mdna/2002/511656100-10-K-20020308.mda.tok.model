item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition growth and expansion as of december   the company had offices serving counties in northern indiana 
the company added two new offices and sold five existing offices during since  the company has added eighteen new offices through acquisition and internal growth 
as a result of the office sales in  total assets decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  the company opened a third office in st 
joseph county in may and a third office in allen county in september the company intends to open an office in dekalb county in and also continues to evaluate additional expansion opportunities 
the company will consider future acquisition and expansion opportunities with an emphasis on markets that it believes would be receptive to its business philosophy of local  independent banking 
on september   the company sold five southern market offices to first farmers bank and trust of converse  indiana 
the offices included in the sale are located in peru  greentown  wabash  roann  and logansport  indiana 
collectively  the offices had approximately million in deposits  million in loans  million in intangible assets  million in fixed assets and million in vault cash 
the sale resulted in a gain of  management believes the sale of these non strategic branches will position the company to focus on growth opportunities in its core northern markets  which are anchored by the cities of warsaw  fort wayne  elkhart and south bend  indiana 
the divestiture of five branches resulted in a decrease in assets of million  or from billion in to billion in including the sale of the five branches  total loans increased  or million  from million in to million in commercial loans increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in mortgage loans and a decrease of million  or  in consumer loans 
these changes reflect the strategy implemented in to focus on commercial loan growth  as well as somewhat tighter credit standards due to the weaker economic conditions 
total securities decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decision to decrease the security portfolio was primarily driven by the decrease in deposits from the branch sale 
core deposits  total deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements also decreased  or million  from million in to million in as a result of the branch sale 
the primary decrease was in large time deposits  which decreased million  or from million in to million in the company experienced a million  or  growth in assets from billion in to billion in the primary increase occurred in total loans  which increased  or million  from million in to million in commercial loans grew from million to million  an increase of million versus consumer loans decreased million  or  versus during  the company strategically focused on loan growth in the commercial loan portfolio that historically produces higher returns than the consumer loan portfolio 
mortgage loans increased  or million  versus to million  reflecting the higher volume of mortgage originations and the company s decision to retain a higher volume of mortgage loans versus selling the loans in the secondary market 
core deposits  total deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements increased million  or  from million in to million in large time deposits  which are primarily short term  increased million  or  from million in to million in the company utilized these deposit increases to fund the loan and other asset growth that occurred during liquidity management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
the company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet these potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio 
given current prepayment assumptions  the cash flow from the securities portfolio is expected to provide approximately million of funding in in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   the company had million in federal fund lines with correspondent banks and may borrow up to million at the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the company recorded its securities in the available for sale afs portfolio 
therefore the company may sell securities to meet funding demands 
management believes that the securities in the afs portfolio are of high quality and would therefore be marketable 
approximately of this portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  federal agency securities or mortgage backed securities directly or indirectly backed by the federal government 
in addition  the company has historically sold mortgage loans on the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create an additional source of funding 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million as of december to million as of december  the primary driver of this decrease was the effect of the branch sale 
other uses of funds were purchases of securities  an increase in loans and payments for the branch sale 
purchases of securities totaled million 
net loans increased million in  which was net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during payments for the branch sale were million 
the major sources of funds included proceeds from sales  calls and maturities of securities of million and proceeds from the sale of loans of million 
lower interest rates created more demand for residential real estate mortgage loans and resulted in an increase in proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million to million as of december  a million increase in deposit balances was the primary driver behind this change 
other sources of funds included proceeds from calls and maturities of securities totaling million and proceeds from the sales of loans of million 
a rising rate environment contributed to a slowing demand for residential real estate mortgage loans and resulted in a decrease in proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans 
in addition  the company did not generate any securities gains in versus securities gains of million in the major uses of funds included an increase in loans  purchases of securities and fixed asset additions 
loans increased approximately million  which was net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during purchases of securities totaled million and purchases of land  premises and equipment were million 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million as of december  lower interest rates prevailed in thereby maintaining a demand for residential real estate loans 
proceeds from the sale of loans were million in other sources of funds included proceeds from sales  calls and maturities of securities totaling million 
the sale of loans and securities also contributed million to pre tax income 
the major uses of funds included an increase in loans  purchases of securities and fixed asset additions 
net loans increased approximately million in  which was net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during purchases of securities were million and fixed asset additions were million 
asset liability management alco and securities interest rate risk represents the company s primary market risk exposure 
the company does not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  does not own any derivative financial instruments and does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the board of directors annually reviews and approves the alco policy used to manage interest rate risk 
this policy sets guidelines for balance sheet structure  which are designed to protect the company from the impact that interest rate changes could have on net income  but does not necessarily indicate the effect on future net interest income 
given the company s mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest bearing assets on december   the net interest margin could be expected to decline in a falling interest rate environment and conversely  to increase in a rising rate environment 
during  the federal reserve lowered the target for the federal funds rate on eleven occasions  decreasing the rate from on january  to by december   a total of basis points 
these actions caused a corresponding decrease in lake city bank s prime rate from to 
due to the asset sensitive nature of the balance sheet  these rate decreases have had an adverse impact on the company s net interest margin during fiscal during  the company took an aggressive position in managing the liability pricing structure in an attempt to optimize the net interest margin in a declining rate environment 
the company utilizes a computer program to stress test the balance sheet under a wide variety of interest rate scenarios 
the model quantifies the income impact of changes in customer preference for products  basis risk between the assets and the liabilities that support them and the risk inherent in different yield curves  as well as other factors 
the alco committee reviews these possible outcomes and makes loan  investment and deposit decisions that maintain reasonable balance sheet structure in light of potential interest rate movements 
although management does not consider gap ratios in this planning  the information can be used in a general fashion to look at asset and liability mismatches 
the company s cumulative gap ratio as of december   for the next months  was a negative of earning assets 
the following tables provide information regarding the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for loans  securities and liabilities with contractual maturities  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities  as well as the company s historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of residential and home equity loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits such as demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the tables present principal cash flows and  as applicable  related weighted average interest rates 
these factors are based upon the company s historical experience  management s judgment and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
weighted average variable rates are based upon rates existing at the reporting date

the changes in the balances primarily reflect the growth of the company s existing offices and the acceptance of the two offices opened during the year offset by the sale of five offices during the year 
the increase in loans during was driven primarily by strong growth in the company s commercial loan portfolio 
the average interest rates show the effect of the basis point reduction in the bank s prime rate during the major impact has been in the average interest rate for variable rate loans  which decreased basis points during the year 
the company s investment portfolio consists of us treasuries  agencies  mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds and corporate bonds 
during  purchases in the securities portfolio consisted primarily of mortgage backed securities 
as of december   the company s investment in mortgage backed securities represented approximately of total securities and consisted of cmos and mortgage pools issued by gnma  fnma and fhlmc 
the federal government backs these securities  directly or indirectly 
all mortgage securities purchased by the company are within risk tolerances for price  prepayment  extension and original life risk characteristics contained in the company s investment policy 
the company uses bloomberg analytics to evaluate and monitor all purchases 
as of december   the securities in the afs portfolio had a two and one third year average life with approximately price depreciation in the event of a basis points upward movement 
the portfolio had approximately price appreciation in the event of a basis point downward movement in rates 
as of december   all mortgage securities were performing in a manner consistent with management s original expectations 
capital management the company believes that a strong  aggressively managed capital position is critical to long term earnings and expansion 
bank regulatory agencies exclude the market value adjustment created by sfas no 
afs adjustment from capital adequacy calculations 
excluding this adjustment from the calculation  the company had tier i leverage capital  tier i risk based capital and tier ii risk based capital ratios of  and as of december  these ratios met or exceeded the fdic well capitalized minimums of  and 
the ability to maintain and grow these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december   from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment of million  net of tax  a negative minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax  and  for the purchase of treasury stock 
this afs adjustment reflected a basis point decrease in the two to five year us treasury rates during the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment of million  net of tax  and  for the purchase of treasury stock 
this afs adjustment reflected a basis point decrease in two to five year us treasury rates during due to the fact that the securities portfolio is primarily fixed rate  a negative equity adjustment would likely occur if interest rates increased 
management has factored this into the determination of the size of the afs portfolio to assure that stockholders equity is adequate under various scenarios 
other than those indicated in this management s discussion  management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that would have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital and results of operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations that  if implemented  would have such an effect 
allowance for credit risk at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  versus million  or  of total loans outstanding at december  the process of identifying probable credit losses is a subjective process 
therefore  the company maintains a general allowance to cover probable credit losses within the entire portfolio 
the methodology management uses to determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve includes the following management reviews the larger individual loans primarily in the commercial loan portfolio for unfavorable collectability factors including impairment and assesses the requirement for specific reserves on such credits 
for those loans not subject to specific review  management reviews historical loan loss experience and ratios to establish trends in charge offs by loan category 
the ratios of net charge offs to a particular type of loan enables management to establish probable losses by loan category and thereby establish appropriate reserves for loans that are not specifically reviewed 
management reviews the current economic conditions of its lending market to determine the effect by loan category  as well as the effect on the aggregate loan portfolio 
management reviews delinquent loan reports to determine risk of loss 
high delinquencies are generally indicative of an increase in loan losses 
as a result of the methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in versus million in the increase in the provision reflected a number of factors as a result of more challenging economic conditions during  including the increase in the size of the loan portfolio  the increase of  in net charge offs  the amount of impaired loans and management s overall view on current credit quality 
overall  net loan growth in was million versus million in impaired loans as of december  and were million and million 
million of the impaired loan total was included in the total for nonaccrual loans 
the impaired loans for included twelve notes with one borrower totaling million 
subsequent to year end  these notes were consolidated as part of a restructuring of the debt into a single  amortizing loan 
the borrower was current on all principal and interest under this note  as of the date of this filing 
in addition  the company improved its collateral position by securing collateral totaling approximately million of marketable securities supporting the personal guarantee 
the company allocated million and  of the allowance for loan losses to the impaired loans in and as of december   loans past due days or more and still accruing were  excluding impaired loans versus million as of year end the decrease in loans past due days or more and still accruing resulted primarily from the customer s refinancing of a million loan with another bank  and the refinancing of terms of a million loan 
as of december   nonaccrual loans were  versus  as of year end the increase in nonaccrual loans resulted from the inclusion of four commercial loans totaling million 
overall  the trend in non performing loans reflects the weakening economic conditions in some of the company s markets  as well as the general economic weakness prevalent throughout much of the country 
the company believes that its overall expansion strategy has employed a credit risk management approach that promotes diversification and therefore creates a balanced portfolio with appropriate risk parameters 
the company has experienced growth in total loans over the last three years of million  or 
the concentration of this loan growth was in the commercial loan portfolio 
commercial loans comprised  and of the total loan portfolio at december   and traditionally  this type of lending may have more credit risk than other types of lending because of the size and diversity of the credits 
the company manages this risk by adjusting its pricing to the perceived risk of each individual credit and by diversifying the portfolio by customer  product  industry and geography 
management believes that it is prudent to continue to provide for loan losses in a manner consistent with its historical approach due to loan growth described above and current economic conditions 
inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more of the components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having a corresponding affect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the company 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the reverse situation may occur 
results of operations versus the company reported record net income of million in  an increase of  or versus net income of million in net interest income increased million  or  to million versus million in interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease occurred as a result of a basis point reduction in the bank s prime rate  which was driven by corresponding cuts by the federal reserve bank during interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the company had a net interest margin of in versus in average earning assets increased by million to billion in versus million in the primary driver was a million increase in the average daily loan balance
