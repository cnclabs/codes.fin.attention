quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities  the company utilizes a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations 
the company s short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings 
at september  and  the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
during  the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were million compared to million in at september   the carrying value of bank borrowings was million compared to million at september  the company s results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on these short term obligations 
if market interest rates would have averaged percent higher than actual levels in either or  the effect on the company s results of operations would not have been material 
the fair values of these obligations approximated their carrying values at september  and  and would not have been materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of million at september  and million at september  the fair value of this debt was million at september  and million at september  the potential loss in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 
the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed rate instruments and  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the company s results of operations or shareowners equity 
in september  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract the swap which effectively converted its million aggregate principal amount of notes  payable in  to floating rate debt based on six month libor 
the floating rate was percent at september  a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or the company s results of operations 
foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies

in addition  the company enters into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
it is the policy of the company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company does not hedge its exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars 
a percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
at september  and  the company had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar and swiss franc 
the use of these contracts allows the company to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to the financial condition  results of operations or shareowners equity of the company
