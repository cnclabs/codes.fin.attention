critical accounting policies estimates or judgments the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are affected by management s application of accounting policies  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition on long term contracts  contract loss reserves  reserves for inventory valuation  review for impairment of goodwill  pension assumptions and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
these critical accounting policies were reviewed with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
in  of the company s sales were accounted for using the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting for long term contracts which recognizes sales and costs as work is performed in advance of the delivery of the product 
the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting is used primarily on the company s aircraft and space contracts  which typically have longer performance cycles  resulting in the matching of sales with costs as they are incurred throughout the duration of the contract 
the remaining sales were recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product transferred to the customer  principally as units were shipped 
percentage of completion cost to cost accounting for long term contracts requires a disciplined cost estimating system in which all functions of the business are integrally involved 
the company believes it has adequate systems and procedures that result in complete and accurate cost estimates by contract 
these cost estimates rely on engineering and manufacturing assessments of progress achieved against technical or performance milestones  and are validated using applicable product or project cost history 
contract prices  or contract values  are generally based on the terms and conditions specified in the contract or in the related customer purchase orders 
however  the effort required under a contract can change during the performance period 
these changes are typically in the form of a directed scope change from the customer  or a claim by the company for an adjustment to the contract value based upon requirements that are different from the contract s baseline requirements 
the company includes an estimate of scope changes or claims in the contract value for purposes of revenue recognition only when that amount can be reliably estimated and when realization is considered probable 
at september   approximately million of unnegotiated scope changes or claims were included in contract values used in the determination of sales and operating profit 
the company reviews contract cost estimates and contract values  including unnegotiated claims and scope changes  on a quarterly basis 
as a result of these reviews  sales and costs of sales are appropriately recorded in the statement of earnings to reflect the most current assessment of each contract s percentage of completion 
contract loss reserves 
for contracts in which the estimated costs at completion  exclusive of allocated general and administrative period costs  exceed the estimated contract value  a loss reserve for the entire remaining loss is recorded when the loss becomes known 
loss reserves are more common on firm fixed price contracts that involve  to varying degrees  the design and development of new and unique controls or control systems to meet customers specifications 
the determination of contract loss reserves is made on a specific contract basis and  therefore  no general reserves are maintained 
once established  the amount of the loss reserve is reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted  if necessary  based on progress made and on updated cost estimates including a current assessment of any remaining risks 
provisions for losses on contracts are reflected in the statement of earnings as additional cost of sales 
as costs are incurred  the previously established contract loss reserve included in current liabilities is reduced 
as of september   contract loss reserves were million 
reserves for inventory valuation 
as of september   inventories represent approximately of total assets and of current assets 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market with cost determined primarily on the first in  first out method of valuation and exclude amounts allocated to long term contracts in progress 
the company records valuation reserves to provide for slow moving or obsolete inventory or to reduce inventory to net realizable value 
for slow moving or obsolete inventory  the company uses both a formula based method that increases the valuation reserve as the inventory ages and  supplementally  a specific identification method 
determining the appropriate reserve for inventory valuation requires significant knowledge of the business 
management considers overall inventory levels in relation to firm customer backlog as well as forecasted demand including consideration of aftermarket sales 
inventory obsolescence reserves also consider issues such as low demand or technological obsolescence 
the company s inventory valuation reserve represents a reduction in inventory cost which creates a new cost basis of accounting 
the reserve amount is maintained in a general ledger account separate from the gross inventory cost 
once a reserve is established for an inventory item  it is removed upon the subsequent use or disposition of the item 
as of september   the reserve for inventory valuation was million  or of gross inventories 
reviews for impairment of goodwill 
the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on october  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but is reviewed for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
as of september   the company had million of goodwill 
in testing for impairment of goodwill  companies are required to allocate goodwill among reporting units  estimate fair values of those reporting units and determine their carrying values 
the company s reporting units are the operating segments used for segment reporting aircraft controls  space controls and industrial controls 
this determination was made based on the similarities of the components of these groups as well as the components not qualifying as businesses themselves 
the process of evaluating the company s goodwill for potential impairment is subjective and requires significant estimates 
these estimates include judgments about future cash flows of the reporting units and allocations of commonly shared assets to the reporting units  as well as the estimates of the company s cost of capital that was used to discount projected future cash flows 
based on the discounted present values of the projected cash flows  management concluded that there is no impairment of the company s goodwill 
pension assumptions 
the company maintains defined benefit plans covering substantially all employees in six countries 
the us plans represent of the consolidated projected benefit obligation as of september  the accounting for these plans is based in part on certain assumptions that may be highly uncertain and may have a material impact on the financial statements if different reasonable assumptions had been used 
the assumption for return on assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
the assumed return on assets of used in for the us plans was determined with reference to the fund s investment mix as of september  of equities and fixed income securities  along with forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
had the company selected a return on assets that was basis points lower  pension expense for us plans for would have been million higher than the amount recorded 
the return on assets that will be used in is for us plans 
in addition to the return on assets assumption  assumptions for the rate of compensation increase and discount rate were made 
the rate of compensation increase used in determining the pension cost was for the us plans and was determined using a long term projection for inflation in addition to real wage increase assumptions 
the discount rate used in determining the pension cost was for us plans 
consistent with prior years  the company used the aa corporate bond rate as the discount rate for us plans 
at september   the discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation was deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
as of september   the company had total gross deferred tax assets of million 
these assets relate principally to domestic liabilities or asset valuation reserves including pension and vacation accruals  inventory obsolescence  bad debt reserves and contract loss reserves 
the company believes that based on recent historical earnings performance and current projections  a valuation allowance is not required against the domestic portion of these deferred tax assets  which totaled million as of september  deferred tax assets recorded as of september  by the company s foreign subsidiaries totaled million  of which million relates to net operating losses 
the company has a million valuation allowance recorded against this asset as of september  representing of the gross asset related to net operating losses 
management believes this reserve is adequate after considering recent operating performance  future financial projections  tax planning strategies and the allowable tax carryforward period

compared with consolidated 
net sales for increased to million from million in sales increased by million in aircraft controls and million in space controls  while sales decreased by million in industrial controls 
net sales for included incremental sales of million from industrial and space related acquisitions 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to a favorable change in product mix towards more profitable military aircraft sales  in particular aftermarket sales 
in  sales of controls for military aircraft represented of net sales compared to of net sales in in addition  operating losses narrowed on business jets  in part due to a favorable million adjustment in the third quarter of related to progress made on certain scope change negotiations 
these improvements were partially offset by weak margins for industrial products due primarily to lower sales 
estimated costs to complete are reviewed quarterly for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting 
for those contracts with anticipated losses at completion  a contract loss reserve is recorded when the loss becomes known 
additions to contract loss reserves are reflected in the statement of earnings in cost of sales 
additions were million in  mostly related to unforeseen expanded work requirements on certain firm fixed price commercial business jet development contracts 
the company also recorded million of contract loss reserves related to acquisitions as part of purchase accounting 
during  million of contract loss reserves  primarily related to business jet development contracts  were utilized as costs were incurred and were reflected as reductions to the previously established contract loss reserve included in current liabilities 
contract loss reserves were also reduced by million related to progress made on certain scope change negotiations for business jet development contracts 
the net decrease in contract loss reserves was million in  compared to a net decrease of million in reserves for inventory valuation are recorded for obsolete or slow moving inventory as well as for reductions of inventory to net realizable value 
the net increase in reserves for inventory valuation was million in  compared to a net increase of million in additions to the reserve in were million higher as compared to the increase is primarily within the aircraft controls segment  and to a lesser extent  the industrial controls segment where product specifications or projected future demand have changed during the year resulting in inventory levels that  in management s estimation  are in excess of amounts needed to fulfill existing and future sales requirements 
reductions to the reserve resulting from inventory being disposed of were million less in as compared to  primarily in the space controls segment 
most of this inventory had been previously reserved and the reserve balance was relieved when the inventory was disposed 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the higher levels of research and development related primarily to a variety of aircraft controls initiatives  including a new flap actuation system for the business jet market  a new pump and motor design for military aircraft applications  controls for unmanned combat aircraft and active vibration controls for helicopters 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel related costs  including wage and salary increases and costs related to a stock based deferred compensation plan for certain officers and directors  and higher professional fees 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates and reduced debt levels  each contributing approximately equally to the decrease 
the reduced debt levels are primarily related to million of net proceeds from the november equity offering in addition to million of reduced net debt levels related to cash flow from operations 
other expense was million in compared to zero in the increase is primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange impacts in the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate relates to additional export tax benefits that the company claimed in on amended  and us tax returns and a reorganization of the company s european operations 
this decrease was partially offset by a first quarter charge related to decreasing a deferred tax asset in europe for a change in a statutory tax rate enacted in during the fourth quarter  additional tax benefits related to the distribution of foreign earnings were offset by a valuation allowance adjustment related to deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses 
in  net earnings increased to million from million in diluted eps increased to in from in aircraft controls 
net sales in aircraft controls increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to a million increase in sales on fighter aircraft programs  an million increase in military aftermarket sales  related primarily to the f fighter aircraft and the black hawk helicopter  and a million increase in sales to oems for the black hawk and sea hawk helicopter programs 
the million increase in sales on fighter aircraft programs is primarily comprised of million on the f joint strike fighter  million on the f and million on the f a e f programs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in boeing oem sales resulting from lower build rates  million  or  in commercial aftermarket sales related to the reduced number of commercial airplane flights  million in flight controls for airbus and million related to business jets 
operating margins for aircraft controls increased to in from in the increase is primarily a result of the higher levels of military aftermarket sales  narrowed operating losses on business jets  including a favorable million adjustment in the third quarter of related to progress on certain scope change negotiations  and better margins on certain fighter aircraft as production rates increase 
twelve month backlog for aircraft controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase is due to an increase on the f joint strike fighter  partially offset by a decrease for commercial aircraft 
space controls 
net sales in space controls increased to million in from million in an million increase during the first nine months of was partially offset by a decrease of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from lower sales of controls for tactical missiles and  to a lesser extent  satellites 
the increase in sales for the year is primarily due to increases of million for satellite controls  all related to acquisitions  million on the space shuttle refurbishment effort and million on the hellfire tactical missile program 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales of controls for launch vehicles related to the wind down on the titan iv program and lower development activity on evolved expendable launch vehicle programs 
operating margins for space controls decreased to in from in the decrease in margins is primarily related to poor operating performance on contracts associated with the perkinelmer acquisition in and lower sales in the fourth quarter of that resulted in fourth quarter operating margins of 
these decreases were partially offset by increases due to higher volume and better cost experience on the space shuttle refurbishment effort and favorable cost performance on the crew return vehicle  which is nearing completion  and tactical missile programs such as hellfire  tow and agm popeye 
twelve month backlog for space controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the decrease primarily relates to programs that are near completion such as the crew return vehicle and reduced orders for satellites and tactical missiles such as the agm popeye  which was completed  and the hellfire missile program that has entered a production break 
industrial controls 
net sales in industrial controls decreased to million in from million in the decrease in sales associated with the global industrial economic slowdown included a million decrease for controls for motion simulators  a million decrease for controls for plastic injection molding machinery  a million decrease for electric drives and a million decrease for turbine controls 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in sales for combat controls and million of incremental sales from acquisitions 
operating margins for industrial controls decreased to in from in the decrease in margins resulted from low volume in industrial markets and an unfavorable product mix weighted more towards lower margin standard products 
twelve month backlog for industrial controls was million at september  compared to million at september  excluding the impact of the acquisition of tss and foreign currency exchange  backlog decreased by million primarily due to generally soft industrial markets 
compared with consolidated 
net sales for increased to million from million in sales in industrial controls increased by million and sales in aircraft controls increased by million  while sales in space controls decreased by million 
excluding the impact of a stronger us dollar in compared to foreign currencies  primarily the euro  british pound  and the yen  sales would have increased by an additional million over during  the company acquired the space valve business of perkinelmer  the industrial radial piston pump business of bosch  whitton technology  which designs and manufactures pumps and specialty products for producers of industrial power generating equipment  and vickers electrics  which manufactures high performance industrial electric drives 
these acquisitions generated million of sales in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the increase is primarily due to lower margins in industrial controls 
in  million of contract loss reserves were recorded  compared to million in inventory valuation provisions were million in both and research and development expense increased by million in to million  or of sales 
the increase is attributable to a variety of aircraft initiatives 
interest expense decreased million to million in due to a decline in interest rates  partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions 
the company s effective tax rate for was compared to in the decrease resulted from higher us tax incentives on export sales in in  net earnings increased to million compared to million in diluted eps increased to in from in aircraft controls 
net sales in aircraft controls increased to million in compared to million in boeing commercial sales increased million due to higher production rates in sales of controls increased million for fighter aircraft  primarily the f a e f for which production levels continued to increase 
sales also increased million for engine controls  million for aftermarket sales  and million for controls on business aircraft 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales on the b bomber program which has been completed 
operating margins for aircraft controls were in compared to in the improvement in margins primarily resulted from favorable product mix and cost performance on production programs 
additions to contract loss reserves were million in both and  primarily related to business jet development contracts 
twelve month backlog for aircraft controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase was due to increases in backlog for military programs including the black hawk and sea hawk helicopters and f a e f that outweighs decreases in backlog for commercial aircraft 
space controls 
net sales in space controls decreased to million in from million in a million decrease in sales for launch vehicles  primarily the titan iv program which was completed in  was partially offset by an increase of million for satellite controls 
operating margins for space controls increased to in from in the improvement in margins is primarily due to cost improvement on newer programs  including the crew return vehicle and various tactical missile programs  as well as increased volume for satellite controls 
twelve month backlog for space controls increased to million at september  from million at september  primarily related to refurbishments on the space shuttle 
industrial controls 
net sales in industrial controls increased to million in from million in excluding the impact of a strong us dollar relative to foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the yen  sales would have increased an additional million 
the increase in net sales is primarily related to the acquisitions of the radial piston pump product line  whitton and vickers electrics that generated million of incremental sales in excluding the effects of the acquisitions  sales increased million for turbine controls  million for motion simulator controls  million within heavy industry and million for various other industrial applications  while sales to the plastics market decreased million due to softness in the injection molding machinery market  particularly in the asian pacific region 
operating margins for industrial controls decreased to in from in the decline in the margins is primarily attributable to lower volume in the plastics markets and  to a lesser extent  pricing pressures in the turbines business 
twelve month backlog for industrial controls increased to million at september  from million at september  primarily due to the acquisitions 
financial condition and liquidity the company s credit facility consists of a term loan payable quarterly through  which had a balance of million at september   and a million revolver of which million was outstanding at september the credit facility expires in december interest on the credit facility continues at libor plus a spread that was basis points on september  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s us assets 
the credit facility contains various covenants that adjust over the term of the facility 
as of september   the covenant for minimum consolidated net worth  defined as the sum of capital stock and additional paid in capital plus retained earnings or minus accumulated deficits  was million  the covenent for the minimum interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to total interest expense was  the covenant for the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of i adjusted ebitda minus capital expenditures to ii the sum of interest expense  provision for taxes and regularly scheduled principal payments on debt was  and the covenant for the maximum leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of total debt including letters of credit less aggregate cash balances to adjusted ebitda was adjusted ebitda is defined as i the sum of net income  interest expense  provisions for taxes based on income  total depreciation expense  total amortization expense and other non cash items reducing net income minus ii other non cash items increasing net income 
additionally  the credit facility limited capital expenditures to million in and restricts the payment of cash dividends to common stockholders 
as of september   the company was in compliance with all covenants 
at september   the company had million of unused borrowing capacity under short and long term lines of credit  including million from the credit facility 
total debt decreased to million at september  from million at september  the reduction in debt primarily resulted from the application of million from the november equity offering in addition to million of cash flows from operations  partially offset by the million purchase price for tecstar and million related to the tss acquisition 
long term debt to capitalization decreased to at september  from at september cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash from operations was primarily due to the increase in earnings adjusted for non cash charges 
net property  plant and equipment was million at september  compared to million at september  capital expenditures in were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million in capital expenditures in were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million 
capital expenditures in are expected not to exceed million 
the company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating lease arrangements 
at september   future minimum rental payments required under noncancelable operating leases was million 
the company believes its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under short and long term lines of credit will continue to be sufficient to meet its operating needs 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
the company must adopt this standard for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
it rescinds sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related taxes  and requires that they be reported as part of earnings from operations 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
the company will adopt this standard on october  and believes it will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains its fundamental provisions for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and those to be disposed of by sale 
the company will adopt this standard on october  and believes it will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation will be recorded in the period in which it is incurred  and the carrying amount of the related long lived asset will be increased 
over time  the liability will be adjusted for revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of cash flows and the passage of time 
the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the asset s useful life 
a gain or loss will be recorded if necessary upon settlement of the liability 
the company will adopt this standard on october  and believes it will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
outlook the company has updated its outlook for from the discussion in its form q for the quarter ended june  filed august  net sales are expected to approximate million compared to million previously expected 
this million decrease consists of an million upward adjustment in aircraft controls  a million downward adjustment in space controls related to orders for controls on satellites and space vehicles and a million downward adjustment in industrial controls related primarily to turbine controls 
the upward adjustment in aircraft controls reflects a million increase in military sales  primarily in aftermarket and on the f fighter program and  to a lesser extent  on the f joint strike fighter and v osprey  and a million decrease in commercial aircraft sales due to lower boeing build rates and lower expected aftermarket sales 
operating margins for are expected to be  unchanged from the previous outlook 
however  the updated outlook reflects higher margins for aircraft controls than previously forecasted  offset by lower margins for space controls on reduced volume 
the outlook for net earnings and earnings per share has not changed from the previous outlook 
the forecasted net sales of million represents a increase over sales are expected to increase in aircraft controls and industrial controls and decrease in space controls 
aircraft controls sales are expected to increase to million in  with a million increase in the military aircraft business  offset by a million decrease in the commercial aircraft business 
the increase in the military aircraft business primarily relates to the ramp up on the f joint strike fighter aircraft program  for which sales are expected to increase by million to million in also  v tiltrotor sales are expected to increase by million primarily related to supplying redesigned swashplate actuators in conformity with the latest customer specifications 
military aftermarket sales are expected to increase by million related to the f fighter aircraft  for updating hydraulic drive units on the leading edge flaps and for overhauling wingfold actuators 
sales on the f are also expected to increase due to increased production as a result of the recently announced korean government buy as well as for subassemblies and parts to support the japanese production at mitsubishi 
the decrease in the commercial aircraft business is primarily related to boeing oem sales  partially offset by increased sales on business jets 
aftermarket sales are forecasted to remain flat with the level of million 
space controls sales are expected to decrease to million in the decrease reflects a million decrease in satellites reflecting a slow down in the geo satellite market and a million decrease in space vehicles related to the completion of work on the crew return vehicle 
sales on tactical missiles are also expected to decrease  reflecting the completion of the agm program and a production break on hellfire 
these decreases are expected to be partially offset by increases for development work on the second generation reusable launch vehicles and missile defense 
industrial controls sales are expected to increase to million in  primarily due to a stronger euro and a million increase in combat controls 
these increases  along with increases for controls for plastic injection molding machinery  motion simulators and a full year of sales from tss  are expected to be offset by a million decrease in sales for turbines related to the soft power generation market combined with intense competitive pressures 
consolidated operating margins for are expected be  compared to in aircraft controls operating margins are expected to decrease to in from in  reflecting higher volume on the cost plus f joint strike fighter aircraft development program that carries lower margins 
space controls operating margins are expected to decrease to in from in as a result of lower volume and the completion of certain programs whose contribution margins were relatively strong in including the crew return vehicle 
industrial controls operating margins are expected to increase to in from in as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in and higher volume 
an increase in consolidated sales and lower non operating expenses  which include interest and corporate expense  are expected to offset lower operating margins in this is expected to result in a increase in net earnings to million in and a increase in diluted earnings per share to in the company expects that earnings per share for each of the quarters in will also increase by approximately over the prior year quarters 
regarding cash flow  the company plans to increase funding on pension plans by approximately million over the million paid during in addition  the company plans to reduce debt by approximately million in  primarily over the last three quarters of the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of business  has exposures to interest rate risks from its long term debt obligations and foreign exchange rate risk with respect to its foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
to minimize these risks  the company may enter into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
for the year ended september   the company s exposure to derivatives was primarily limited to interest rate swaps that were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
the company s borrowings under variable interest rate facilities were million at september  in order to provide for interest rate protection  the company has interest rate swap agreements 
of the million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at september   million matures immediately after year end 
the remaining million effectively converts this amount to fixed rate debt at and matures in february and march  at which time the interest will revert back to a variable rate based on libor plus the applicable margin 
if interest rates had changed by one percentage point  the impact on consolidated interest expense from the company s variable rate debt would have been approximately million in the majority of the company s sales  expenses and cash flows are transacted in us dollars 
the company does have some market risk exposure with respect to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as it relates to the value of the us dollar versus the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound 
if foreign exchange rates were to collectively weaken or strengthen against the us dollar by  net earnings would be reduced or increased  respectively  by approximately million related to currency exchange rate translation exposures and million related to pressures on operating margins for products sourced in non us countries 
the company uses on a limited basis forward contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party raw material purchases  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans and to reduce fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in  and long term advances to  subsidiaries 
at september   there were no significant contracts outstanding
