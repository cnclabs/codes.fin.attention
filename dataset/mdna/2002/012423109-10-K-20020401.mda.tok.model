item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included within this report 
overview we are a leading chemistry based drug discovery and development company  focused on applications for new small molecule prescription drugs 
we engage in comprehensive chemistry research from lead discovery  optimization and development to commercial manufacturing 
we perform chemistry research for many of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and for our own internal research and development 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  unbilled revenue  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and profit on less than ten percent of our contract revenue as work progresses using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method because we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have estimated the fair value of our libraries of natural product compounds obtained as part of our acquisition of new chemical entities in january and have included their value in our inventory 
we also develop novel compounds internally and include their value at cost in our inventory 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
we hold a minority interest in organichem corporation and have acquired several companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment or an acquisition has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments or company acquisitions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments or acquisitions that may not be reflected in their current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
net contract revenue our net contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers  net of our reimbursed expenses 
reimbursed expenses consist of laboratory supplies  chemicals and other costs reimbursed by our customers and  in accordance with industry practice  are netted against gross contract revenue 
reimbursed expenses vary from contract to contract 
accordingly  we view net contract revenue as our primary measure of revenue growth rather than licensing fees and royalties  which are dependent upon our licensee s sales 
in general  we provide services to our customers on the following basis a full time equivalent basis that establishes the number of full time equivalents contracted for a project or a series of projects  the duration of the contract period  the fixed price per full time equivalent  plus an allowance for out of pocket expenses  which may or may not be incorporated in the full time equivalent rate  a time and materials basis under which we charge our customers based on an hourly rate plus out of pocket expenses  or to a lesser extent  a fixed price basis 
typically  our full time equivalent contracts have terms of six months or longer and our time and materials contracts have terms of one to twelve months 
fixed price contracts are entered into for much shorter periods of time  generally two to six months 
because our fixed price contracts relate to projects that are generally limited in scope and are of short duration  we have not historically experienced any material cost overruns under these contracts 
full time equivalent and time and materials contracts provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon days to one year prior notice  depending on the size of the contract 
we recognize contract revenue on a percentage of completion or per diem basis 
cost of revenue consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees and other direct project related costs 
licensing fees  milestones and royalties we seek to include provisions in our contracts for our discovery services which contain licensing  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology and expertise  lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
to date  we have received substantially all of our milestone and royalty payments under these arrangements from aventis with respect to allegra 
generally  the provisions for licensing  milestone and royalty payments included in our contracts are related to the occurrence of specific identifiable events 
upon the occurrence of one of these events  such as the successful completion of a clinical trial phase  and the resolution of any uncertainties or contingencies regarding potential revenue  we plan to record the payment as revenue in the quarter in which we receive the payment 
non recurring licensing fees  milestones and royalties 
although we entered into a license agreement with aventis in  we began to recognize royalty revenue related to sales in the united states under that agreement in february this delay was due to the significant time expended for issuance of our patents and the resolution of related patent interference claims by aventis 
recurring royalties 
recurring royalties consist of royalties from aventis under a license agreement based on sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
royalty payments are due within days after each calendar quarter and are determined based on sales of allegra telfast in that quarter 
costs and expenses cost of contract revenue 
our cost of contract revenue  from which we derive gross profit from net contract revenue  consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees and other direct project related costs 
technology incentive award 
we maintain a technology development incentive plan designed to stimulate and encourage novel technology development by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor 
under our technology development incentive plan  thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman and chief executive officer  receives payments as the sole inventor of the patents for fexofenadine hcl equal to of the total payments received by us with respect to those patents 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of payments in connection with collaborations with academic institutions  compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary research projects and costs of supplies and related chemicals 
we are funding several internal research and development programs to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for up front license service fees and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
included in our internal research and development projects is a cooperative research and development agreement with the national cancer institute to develop anti cancer compounds  as well as other projects in the oncology  immunosuppression and anti infective therapeutic areas 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing and administrative employees  professional services  marketing costs and all costs related to facilities and information services 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income  interest expense  our equity in our unconsolidated affiliates  organichem and fluorous technologies  realized gains or losses on sales of investment securities and other non operating expenses

income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the effective rate for our provision for income taxes was in and liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
for the year ended december   we generated cash of million from operating activities 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
capital expenditures in were predominantly in connection with the expansion of our facilities in albany and syracuse  new york 
additionally  in september  we acquired the mount prospect  illinois facility and operations from great lakes chemical corporation for approximately million 
we used approximately million to purchase new chemical entities  inc in january during  we generated million from financing activities  consisting of cash generated of million from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under our employee stock purchase program  million from low rate industrial development bond financing  offset by  in payments on capital lease obligations and  used to purchase treasury stock 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  we have available a million credit facility to supplement our liquidity needs 
there were no borrowings under this credit facility at december  we are pursuing the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
in february  we purchased american advanced organics  a provider of rapid scale up manufacturing services  for approximately million in cash and stock 
based on the financial performance of this division in we paid the former aao stockholders an additional  in cash subsequent to december  based on the financial performance of this division in  we paid the former aao stockholders an additional  in cash subsequent to december   representing the final payment under the purchase agreement with the aao stockholders 
in june  we made an investment in fluorous technologies  inc  a newly formed company based in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
fluorous technologies has licensed from the university of pittsburgh several patents and pending patent applications for the use of fluorous organic chemistry technology for chemical synthesis  isolation and purification 
fluorous technologies was formed to capitalize on the potential of this technology for pharmaceutical drug discovery  agrochemical product development  and more environmentally friendly chemical manufacturing 
we invested  in fluorous technologies representing an initial ownership interest 
our ownership interest in fluorous technologies is expected to be diluted to less than as fluorous technologies issues additional common stock to fund its operations and development 
as a result of our investment  a proportionate share of fluorous technologies losses has been included in our consolidated financial results from date of formation 
in january  we acquired new chemical entities  inc of bothell  washington for million in cash and the assumption of million in outstanding debt 
nce possesses an extensive collection of over  diverse compounds and natural products extracts  which are integrated into nce s drug discovery efforts 
these samples are complemented by a chemofocus library composed of pure single compound samples of both natural products and natural product based compounds augmented by combinatorial chemistry and computational drug design 
nce sells or licenses these libraries  or subsets  to customers for high throughput screening and novel drug lead discovery 
in september  we purchased great lakes chemical corporation s  square foot laboratory facility in mt 
prospect  illinois for approximately million in cash 
the facility  located on acres includes chemistry synthesis labs  which contain fully equipped scientific workstations  a two bay  non gmp chemical pilot plant  research fermentation facilities  associated analytical support  scale up fermentation capacity  and supporting office space 
the purchase provides the company with a modern facility  fully equipped with a scientific staff of approximately people with the opportunity for considerable expansion 
during  we repurchased  shares of our own stock 
from time to time we may repurchase additional shares under the stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september  the program allows us to repurchase up to million of our shares over a twelve month period 
through march  we repurchased  additional shares of our stock under our stock repurchase program 
the following table sets forth the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
payments due by period in thousands total under year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt   operating leases      capital leases  related party transactions technology development incentive plan in  we adopted a technology development incentive plan to provide a method to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology development 
to be eligible to participate  the individual must be an employee and must be the inventor or co inventor of novel technology that results in new revenues received by us 
eligible participants will share in awards based on a percentage of the licensing  royalty or milestone revenue received by us  as defined by the plan 
in  and  we awarded technology incentive compensation to the inventor of the terfenadine carboxylic acid metabolite technology 
the inventor is a director  officer and shareholder 
the amounts awarded and included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and are million  million  and million  respectively 
included in accrued compensation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and are unpaid technology development incentive compensation awards of  and million  respectively 
lease agreement we currently have two long term operating lease for our albany  new york office and laboratory facilities with one of our shareholders who owns less than of our common stock 
we paid approximately   and  to this related party during the years ended december   and  respectively 
notes receivable from time to time we make loans to employees and officers of the company in the form of notes receivable 
the notes receivable and accrued interest will not be repaid to the company provided the employee remains in the employ of the company throughout the term of the loan 
if employment is terminated prior to the end of the loan term  a pro rata portion of the principal and interest shall be repaid to the company 
telecommunication services a member of our board of directors is the chief executive officer of one of the providers of telephone and internet services to us 
this telecommunications company was paid  for services rendered to us in recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited 
goodwill will initially be recognized as an asset and measured as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
intangible assets other than goodwill will be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if that asset arises from contractual or other legal rights 
the statement will apply to all business combinations initiated or completed after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill including goodwill reported on the separate gaap financial statements of a subsidiary will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
goodwill will be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill with an impairment loss recorded for excess goodwill  if any 
intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and will be tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life will not be amortized until its life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
to reduce our annual amortization costs by approximately million 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
statement will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors and certain factors affecting forward looking statements the following factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this form k 
except as mentioned under quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion contained in this form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this form k 
important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees we need 
our future growth and profitability depends upon the research and efforts of our highly skilled employees  such as our scientists  and their ability to keep pace with changes in drug discovery and development technologies 
we believe that there is a shortage of scientists  and we compete vigorously with pharmaceutical firms  biotechnology firms  contract research firms  and academic and research institutions to recruit scientists 
if we cannot recruit and retain scientists and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to continue our existing services and will not be able to expand the services we offer to our customers 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may discontinue or decrease their usage of our services 
we depend on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that use our services for a large portion of our revenues 
although there is a trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource drug research and development functions  this trend may not continue 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies discontinue or decrease their usage of our services  including as a result of the slowdown in the overall united states economy  our revenues and earnings could be lower than we expect and our revenues may decrease or not grow at historical rates 
we may lose one or more of our major customers 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately of our contract revenues providing services to three major customers 
our customers typically may cancel their contracts with days to one year s prior notice depending on the size of the contract  for a variety of reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
if any one of our major customers cancels its contract with us  our contract revenues may decrease 
the royalties we earn on allegra may decrease 
we have been issued several patents on a pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  fexofenadine hcl 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  medical and biotechnology firms can be uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions 
litigation  in particular patent litigation  can be complex and time consuming and the outcome is inherently uncertain 
we cannot assure investors that aventis will ultimately succeed in its current litigation against barr laboratories or that aventis or we will succeed in any future similar litigation against generic drug manufacturers involving patents with respect to allegra  including the litigation recently filed by aventis against impax laboratories  inc in response to impax recent anda filing for a generic version of allegra d 
in the event that one or more of the patents owned by us or aventis are ultimately determined to be invalid or unenforceable  aventis and we would lose exclusivity with respect to the claims covered by those patents 
any such loss of exclusivity and the contemporaneous introduction of generic forms of fexofenadine hcl may cause a reduction in allegra sales 
in addition  under our current arrangements with aventis  aventis  with consultation from us  will take the lead with respect to preparing and executing a strategy to defend and enforce certain of their respective patents relating to allegra 
as a result  we may not be able to control the conduct of such litigation and the strategic decisions that are made during the course of such litigation 
on may   an fda advisory panel recommended that the prescription allergy drugs claritin  allegra and zyrtec are safe enough to be made available over the counter 
the panel had been assembled as a result of a petition by blue cross of california now wellpoint health networks requesting that the three top selling prescription antihistamines be changed to otc status 
the fda panel s only consideration was whether claritin  allegra and zyrtec have the safety profile for over the counter use without a learned intermediary 
the panel s recommendation is under consideration by the full fda 
the fda s reaction to its advisory panel s recommendation with regard to the safety of allegra is uncertain 
if the fda determines that allegra may be sold in an over the counter form  there may be an adverse effect on its reimbursement status by third party payers and on the price at which it can be sold 
any such price reduction may not be adequately offset by increased volume of sales 
royalties from sales of allegra currently constitute a significant portion of our total revenues and operating income 
during the year ended december   our royalties from allegra were million  which represented approximately of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   our royalties from allegra were million  which represented approximately of our total revenues 
while a final determination with respect to the barr laboratories and impax laboratories andas filing and the stated patent litigation and the fda advisory panel s safety recommendation may not occur for a significant amount of time  perhaps a number of years  each of these matters may ultimately have a significant adverse impact on sales of allegra 
if the dollar amount of allegra sales subject to our license agreement decreases  due to these or any other factors  our revenues from our license agreement with aventis may decrease 
because we have very few costs associated with the allegra license  a decrease in revenues from our license agreement for allegra would have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operation 
we may be unsuccessful in producing and licensing proprietary technology developed from our internal research and development efforts or acquired from a third party 
we have expended and continue to expend time and money on internal research and development with the intention of producing proprietary technologies in order to patent and then license them to other companies 
however  we may not be successful in producing any valuable technology or successful in licensing it to a third party 
to the extent we are unable to produce technology that we can license  we may not receive any revenues related to our internal research and development efforts 
we may lose valuable intellectual property if we are unable to protect it 
some of our most valuable assets include patents and trade secrets 
part of our business is developing technologies that we patent and then license to other companies 
however  some technologies that we develop may already be patented by other companies 
for this and other reasons  we may not be able to obtain patents for each new technology that we develop 
even if we are able to obtain patents  the patents may not sufficiently protect our interest in the technology 
similarly  we may not be able to protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential 
additionally  protecting our patents and trade secrets may be costly and time consuming 
to the extent we are unable to protect intellectual property  our investment in those technologies may not yield the benefits we expected 
in addition  we may be subject to claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property of others 
we could incur significant costs defending such claims 
if we are unsuccessful in defending these claims  we may be subject to liability for infringement 
we may not be able to license technologies that we need to conduct our business 
in addition to the technologies that we develop  we also rely on technologies that we license from other companies 
we may not be able to license technologies that we need in the future or we may be unable to license such technologies on a commercially reasonable basis 
our inability to license the technologies we need could result in increased costs and  therefore  reduced profits  or the inability to engage in certain activities that require those technologies 
our failure to manage our expansion may adversely affect us 
our business has expanded rapidly in the past several years 
expansion places increased stress on our financial  managerial and human resources 
as we expand  we will need to recruit and retain additional highly skilled scientists and technicians 
expansion of our facilities may lead to increased expenses and may divert management attention away from operations 
future acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management 
we have engaged in a number of acquisitions and strategic investments  and we expect to continue to do so 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  and if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner or at all 
we may have to devote a significant amount of time and resources to do so 
even with this investment of time and resources  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital  management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve non recurring charges and amortization of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to realize the benefits of recent acquisitions and strategic investments 
we acquired enzymed  inc  a provider of combinatorial biocatalysis discovery services  in october  american advanced organics  inc  a contract manufacturer of novel compounds  pharmaceutical intermediates and test drug substances  in february  new chemical entities  a chemistry based drug discovery company  in january  and great lakes chemical company s research and development facility outside of chicago  illinois in september these transactions may not be as beneficial to us as we expect 
in addition to these acquisitions  we made a million strategic investment in organichem corporation in december to facilitate a management buyout of a chemical manufacturing facility from nycomed amersham  plc 
if organichem fails to perform as we expect  our investment may not yield adequate returns or we may lose our investment 
in addition  the other equity holders of organichem have the right to require us to purchase their interests in organichem based on a predetermined formula 
we may be required to purchase their entire interests in at a price that is higher than the fair market value of these interests at the time of purchase  which would negatively impact our financial condition 
we also made a  investment in fluorous technologies  inc in may fluorous technologies is a development stage company and may not be able to successfully develop technology and products 
we may lose one or more of our key employees 
our business is highly dependent on our senior management and scientific staff  including dr 
thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
donald e 
kuhla  our president and chief operating officer  and david p 
waldek  our chief financial officer and treasurer 
although we have employment agreements with the individuals listed above  we do not have employment agreements with all of our key employees 
additionally  the loss of any of our other key employees  including our scientists  may have an adverse effect on our business 
the royalties we earn on allegra will likely be affected by the seasonal nature of allergies 
allergic reactions to plants  pollens and other airborne allergens generally occur during the spring and summer seasons 
therefore  we expect the demand for allegra to be lower during other times of the year 
because allegra sales change seasonally based on the demand for allergy medicines  our quarter to quarter revenues will likely experience fluctuations 
we face increased competition 
we compete directly with the in house research departments of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies  and research and academic institutions 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have 
as new companies enter the market and as more advanced technologies become available  we expect to face increased competition 
in the future  any one of our competitors may develop technological advances that render the services that we provide obsolete 
while we plan to develop technologies  which will give us competitive advantages  our competitors plan to do the same 
we may not be able to develop the technologies we need to successfully compete in the future  and our competitors may be able to develop such technologies before we do 
consequently  we may not be able to successfully compete in the future 
we may be held liable for harm caused by drugs that we develop and test 
we develop  test and  to a limited extent  manufacture drugs that are used by humans 
if any of the drugs that we develop  test or manufacture harms people  we may be required to pay damages to those persons 
although we carry liability insurance  we may be required to pay damages in excess of the amounts of our insurance coverage 
damages awarded in a product liability action could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use 
our research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulation governing the use  manufacture  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
we may also incur expenses relating to compliance with environmental laws 
such expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
if we fail to meet strict regulatory requirements  we could be required to pay fines or even close our facilities 
all facilities and manufacturing techniques used to manufacture drugs in the united states must conform to standards that are established by the federal food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda conducts scheduled periodic inspections of our facilities to monitor our compliance with regulatory standards 
if the fda finds that we fail to comply with the appropriate regulatory standards  it may impose fines on us or  if the fda determines that our non compliance is severe  it may close our facilities 
any adverse action by the fda would have a negative impact on our operations 
our operations may be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our primary facilities 
we depend on our laboratories and equipment for the continued operation of our business

health care reform could reduce the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for drugs they sell which  in turn  could reduce the amounts that they have available to retain our services 
we depend on contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a majority of our revenues 
we therefore depend upon the ability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to earn enough profit on the drugs they market to devote substantial resources to the research and development of new drugs 
future legislation may limit the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for the drugs they market 
such laws may have the effect of reducing the resources that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can devote to the research and development of new drugs 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies decrease the resources they devote to the research and development of new drugs  the amount of services that we perform  and therefore our revenues  could be reduced
