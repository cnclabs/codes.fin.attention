item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and factors affecting future results limited protection of intellectual property 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent issues and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  would relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial porti on of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company may receive communications from third parties in the future asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for all expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any thir d party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

management believes that the future success of the company will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees  including management  technical  and design personnel 
any lengthy delay in filling new positions could lead to delays in the research and development associated with potential new products

backlog the company manufactures its products based  in part  upon its forecast of customer demand and typically builds finished products in advance of or at the time firm orders are received from its customers 
orders for the company s products are generally placed by customers on an as needed basis and the company has typically been able to ship these products within days after the customer submits a firm purchase order 
because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders  the company s backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of sales in any future period

the company also leased an additional  square feet of warehouse space in madison  alabama under a lease that terminated on june  in addition  the company has two sales offices located in the united states  and an engineering office in canada 
these properties are occupied under operating leases that expire on various dates through the year  with options to renew in most instances 
on july   the company relocated its headquarters and principal administrative  engineering and manufacturing operations to a leased facility containing approximately  square feet in madison  alabama 
on august   the company leased its facility located at explorer boulevard to the boeing company under a lease that expires november the lease allows the lessee to terminate the lease at the end of the th month  but also includes the option to extend the lease term for five additional two year periods

the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday nearest to june fiscal and consisted of weeks and fiscal consisted of weeks with a week period for q as compared to weeks for all other quarterly periods 
overview verilink corporation the company provides voice and data network access solutions to service providers and enterprise customers for dds  t e  nxt  t and g 
shdsl communication services 
the company develops  manufactures and markets customer premise equipment cpe and central site solutions for data and telecommunication centers 
the company offers a variety of application specific solutions for time division multiplexing  inverse multiplexing  digital cross connect and ip bridging and routing  as well as converged solutions for access to frame relay  atm and ip based networks 
the company s customers include equipment integrators  network service providers nsps and enterprise customers consisting of wireline and wireless providers  inter exchange carriers ixcs  local exchange carriers lecs  internet service providers isps  fortune companies and various local  state and federal government agencies 
the company was founded in san jose  california in and is a delaware corporation currently headquartered in madison  alabama 
the overall economic environment and the downturn in the telecommunication industry that continued throughout fiscal were worse than we had anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year 
capital spending budgets and headcount were reduced  and projects and programs were delayed by many of our customers 
additionally  carriers and other service providers continued to review opportunities to maximize the use of their existing copper based infrastructure in order to effectively operate in these difficult times 
the company implemented cost reduction programs in fiscal as a result of the reduced revenue levels 
the optical network access development project was terminated in october  headcount was reduced at times during the year to align operating spending with lower revenue levels and certain administrative tasks were outsourced to further reduce costs 
the company reported a quarterly profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due in part to the positive impact of these cost reduction efforts 
the majority of sales continue to be provided by the company s legacy products  primarily the as product line that provided of net sales in fiscal net sales of the wansuite product family  which is a full line of access devices ranging from csu dsus to software programmable intelligent integrated access devices with integrated routing and multi tier reporting  increased in fiscal over fiscal to million 
the company anticipates that net sales from legacy products will shrink in the future 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the company s results of operations have and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future 
results of operations sales fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands net sales    percentage change from preceding year net sales for fiscal decreased to  from net sales of  in fiscal this decrease in net sales resulted from a decrease in sales volume to most of the company s product markets 
carrier and carrier access products net sales  primarily as products  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and enterprise access products decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these decreases were primarily a result of additional reduced capital spending by our large telecommunication infrastructure customers  which was a result of both economic and industry wide factors  including financial constraints affecting our customers and over capacity in our customers markets 
the company anticipates that reduced capital spending by our customers will continue to affect sales until an overall recovery in the telecommuni cations market begins  which is not expected until at least in any event  it is challenging to predict in the current environment 
these large infrastructure customers have traditionally contributed more than half of the company s revenue base 
net sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal to  this decrease was also due primarily to reduced capital spending by our large telecommunication infrastructure customers that began in fiscal during fiscal  shipments of the as product line accounted for approximately of net sales compared to during and in the company s business is characterized by a concentration of sales to a limited number of key customers 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for  and of sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company s five largest customers in fiscal were ericsson  interlink communications systems  nortel networks  verizon and worldcom 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and factors affecting future results customer concentration 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers  system integrators  value added resellers  and distributors 
sales to value added resellers and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in fiscal  as compared to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  direct sales outside of north america have not been significant 
however  the company intends to expand the marketing of its products to markets outside of north america 
gross profit fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands gross profit    percentage of sales gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal year was due to less favorable product sales mix  additional inventory reserves of  for excess inventories  severance costs totaling  and the impact to depreciation expense of  for the change in lives of it assets described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal was a result of significantly lower sales volume and the impact of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead 
in future periods  the company s gross profit will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the cost of products manufactured at subcontract facilities  the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  the mix of products sold  price competition  increases in material costs and changes in other components of cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit margins than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands research and development    percentage of sales research and development r d expenses decreased to  or of sales in fiscal compared to  or of sales in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the suspension of the optical network access development project in october and the impact of cost reduction measures that resulted in a decrease in other product development 
the decrease in r d expense in fiscal year as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal was due to reduced actual expenses on lower sales volume 
the increase in spending and the increase in r d as a percentage of sales in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to the optical network access development project initiated in october  and refocusing r d resources to key product development activities such as wansuite 
in october  the company terminated its agreements with beacon telco  lp and the boston university photonics center discussed below and suspended its optical network access development project 
research and development expenditures in fiscal and related to the optical network access product were  and  respectively 
in october  the company entered into agreements with beacon telco  lp and the boston university photonics center to establish a product development center at the photonics center to develop new optical network access products 
as part of the agreements  the company issued beacon telco warrants for  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share that were exercisable at various dates  and scheduled to expire on october  warrants for  and  shares were exercised during fiscal and  respectively 
the remaining warrants were cancelled in connection with the termination of the agreements with beacon telco  lp and the boston university photonics center 
the agreements provided beacon telco the opportunity to receive two bonus payments based in part on meeting certain milestones and the market price of the company s common stock 
the first bonus payment of  was earned on october  and paid on february  in the form of a note that beacon telco used in conjunction with the exercise of warrants for  shares of the company s common stock 
the second bonus payment was waived in connection with the october termination of these agreements 
the company recorded a charge to research and development expenses in fiscal of  for the warrants and the first bonus payment used in the exercise of the warrants for  shares 
the second bonus  of up to  was payable in full upon the completion of the final milestone in the optical network access project  or if the agreements were terminated  a pro rata portion was payable based on the extent to which the milestones had been completed 
the second bonus would be reduced if the price of the company s common stock was below per share at the time the bonus payment was made 
the company accrued the pro rata portion of the second bonus related to a milestone in the period that the milestone was achieved 
the bonus accrual was adjusted for changes  either increases or decreases  in the closing market price of the company s common stock when the price was below per share 
for fiscal  research and development expenses include  for the accrual of the pro rata portion of the second bonus related to the milestones achieved during the fiscal year and based upon the closing market price of the company s common stock on june  of per share 
the company considers product development expenditures to be important to future sales  but expects research and development expenditures to decrease in fiscal  while such expenditures as a percentage of sales may vary 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
see factors affecting future results dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to  or of sales in fiscal from  or of sales in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to reduced headcount between the two periods  lower variable sales compensation on lower sales volume and other cost reduction programs implemented during the current and prior fiscal years  offset by a charge for bad debts related to amounts outstanding from worldcom of approximately  the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales in fiscal was due entirely to lower sales volume 
sg a decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal due to lower variable sales compensation on lower sales volume  cost reduction programs implemented during fiscal that included a headcount reduction in march  and the impact of the plan that consolidated the company in huntsville which was completed in fiscal the increase in sg a spending as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the decrease in dollar spending at lower sales levels 
the company expects that sg a expenses will decrease in fiscal and decrease as a percentage of sales 
impairment of long lived assets during fiscal  the company completed a review of certain long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  due to uncertainty in the general business environment  particularly the telecommunication markets 
as a result of this review  the company recorded charges of  for impairment of certain long lived assets 
this impairment included charges related to the company s headquarters facility  furniture and equipment of  an investment in a software development company of  intangible assets of  and software licenses of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of the impairment charges 
restructuring charges during fiscal  the company announced and completed the consolidation of its operations into its existing operations located in huntsville  alabama  and outsourced its san jose based manufacturing activities announced in july the company incurred a net restructuring charge during fiscal of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of this restructuring charge 
approximately  of the restructuring charge was cash in nature and paid out of the company s working capital 
interest and other income  net  and interest expense interest and other income  net  declined to  in fiscal from  and  in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of lower average invested cash and short term investment balances  an increase in early payment discounts taken by customers  and lower interest rates 
with the completion of renovations to the headquarters facility in january  the company began charging interest payments on long term debt to interest expense that totaled  and  during fiscal and the last half of fiscal  respectively 
provision for benefit from income taxes no tax benefit was provided in fiscal due to the valuation allowance provided against the net change in deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  the company established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the net operating loss carry forwards from prior years and the operating losses incurred in fiscal the operating losses in fiscal  while not expected at the beginning of the year  were driven by the development costs associated with the optical network access project announced in october  as well as the downturn in the telecommunication market that the company serves 
therefore  the provision for income taxes of  established a full valuation allowance at september  against the company s deferred tax assets 
in fiscal with a return to profitability during the last two quarters of that fiscal year and the expectation of profits in fiscal  the company reversed the deferred tax asset valuation allowance that had been established in fiscal and recorded a net benefit from income taxes of  the effective tax rate in fiscal without the impact of the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was a benefit of approximately  compared to a combined federal and state statutory rate of about 
the effective tax rate in fiscal without the impact of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is less than the combined federal and state rates primarily due to the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the txport acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s principal source of liquidity included  of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during fiscal  the company used  of net cash in operating activities  compared to net cash generated by operating activities in fiscal of  and net cash used in operating activities in fiscal of  accounts receivable increased  to  at june  from the prior year balance due to the timing of shipments during the fourth quarter of each year and the change in the payment terms used by our largest customer 
in fiscal  our largest customer paid invoices early and took advantage of the early payment discounts  while in fiscal this customer began paying within normal payment terms 
accounts receivable decreased  to  at june   over the balance at june  due to timing of shipments and the early payment discount plan utilized by our largest customer in fiscal inventories decreased  to  at june  and decreased  to  at june  as a result of better control of inventory levels in both years and the additional inventory reserves provided in fiscal of  in fiscal  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased a total of  due to the impact of lower sales volume and lower salary and benefit accruals associated with the lower headcount at june  in fiscal  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased in total by  due to the lower sales volume and cost reduction efforts implemented during fiscal net cash used in investing activities of  in fiscal compares to net cash used in investing activities of  in fiscal and net cash provided by investing activities of  in fiscal the cash used in fiscal was due to equipment purchases of  and purchase of short term investments of  reduced by repayment of notes receivable of  the funds used in fiscal were due to capital expenditures of  for renovations to the facility at explorer boulevard  completion of the oracle implementation project in july and other equipment purchases  offset by the maturity of short term investments of  the increase in funds provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily a result of the maturity of  in short term investments reduced by  in purchases of property  plant and equipment that included the purch ase of the facility at explorer boulevard for  notes receivable decreased in fiscal and by  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal and  in fiscal payments against long term debt and capital lease obligations of  and purchase of common stock of  accounted for the use of funds in fiscal proceeds of  less payments of  from loan agreements to borrow up to  to finance the acquisition of the facility at explorer boulevard and improvements thereon and  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans were the primary sources of cash in fiscal from financing activities 
during fiscal  proceeds of  from long term debt used to finance the purchase of the facility at explorer boulevard was the largest source of cash from financing activities along with proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
the company received  and  in fiscal and  respectively from repayment of notes receivable from stockholders 
as discussed in note related party transactions in notes to consolidated financial statements  the company modified the payment terms of the outstanding notes to the company s president and ceo 
under the terms of the note modification agreements  the outstanding balance of one of the notes  with an outstanding balance of  at june   was extended from march to march the note modification agreements provide that the outstanding balance of the second note with an outstanding balance of  as of june  be extended to march however  the company may accelerate the due date of this loan on days notice if the company s aggregate amount of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents or short term investments is less than  or if the president s employment is terminated 
the company believes that its cash and investment balances  along with anticipated cash flows from operations based upon current operating plans and the cost reduction measures implemented by the company in fiscal will be adequate to finance current operations and capital expenditures for the next fiscal year 
the company s future capital needs will depend on the company s ability to meet its current operating forecast  the ability to successfully bring new products to market  market demand for the company s products  and the overall economic strength of our customers in the telecommunication sector 
in the event that results of operations do not substantially meet the company s current operating forecast  the company may evaluate further cost containment  further reduce investments or delay r d  which could adversely affect the company s ability to bring new products to market 
the company from time to time investigates the possibility of generating financial resources through committed credit agreements  technology or manufacturing partnerships  joint ventures  equipment financing  and offerings of debt and equity securities 
to the extent that the company obtains additional financing  the terms of such financing may involve rights  preferences or privileges senior to the company s common stock and stockholders may experience dilution 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods might be based upon amounts that differ from those estimates 
the following represent what the company believes are among the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable under the guidance prescribed by sfas no 
the company s long lived assets include  but are not limited to  the headquarters facility  related furniture and equipment  software licenses  and goodwill and intangible assets related to a previous acquisition 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets during fiscal  the company obtained a third party appraisal for the headquarters facility  and made assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
inventories 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed on a quarterly basis and a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may increase or decrease the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory in future periods 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes a sale when the product has been shipped  no material vendor or post contract support obligations remain outstanding  except as provided by a separate service agreement and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
a reserve for future product returns is established at the time of the sale based on historical return rates and return policies  including stock rotation for sales to distributors that stock the company s products 
warranty provision 
the company records a warranty provision at the time of the sale based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future claims on products sold 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  actual product failure rates  material usage or other rework costs could differ from our estimates  which could result in revisions to our warranty liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates losses resulted from the inability of our customers to make payments for amounts billed 
the collectability of outstanding invoices is continually assessed 
assumptions are made regarding the customer s ability and intent to pay  and are based on historical trends  general economic conditions and current customer data 
should our actual experience with respect to collections differ from these assessments  there could be adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of notes receivable 
the company continually assesses the collectability of assets classified as outstanding notes receivable 
assumptions are made regarding the counter party s ability and intent to pay and are based on historical trends and general economic conditions  and current data 
should our actual experience with respect to collections differ from our initial assessment  adjustments in the reserves may be needed 
deferred tax assets 
the company has provided a full valuation reserve related to its deferred tax assets 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  the company may be required to reduce its valuation allowances  resulting in income tax benefits in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for the valuation allowance each quarter 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which has an effective date starting with fiscal years beginning after december  this statement  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
accordingly  goodwill will cease to be amortized upon the implementation of the statement and companies will test goodwill at least annually for impairment 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective june   and ceased amortizing goodwill of  including  of goodwill previ ously classified as other intangible assets 
the company has completed the transitional impairment analysis of all goodwill and intangible assets that is required by the new statement 
as a result of this analysis  the company will record a charge of  during the first quarter of fiscal to reflect the impairment of the company s goodwill 
amortization of goodwill including goodwill previously classified as other intangible assets was  during fiscal in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no  accounting for asset retirement obligations aro  which has an effective date for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement addresses the diversity in practice for recognizing asset retirement obligations and requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
upon initially recognizing a liability for an aro  an entity must capitalize the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the impact of sfas no 
is not expected to be material to the company s financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which has an effective date for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  this statement expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the company did not elect to early adopt sfas no 
 and is in the process of assessing its impact on the company s financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which has an effective date for transactions occurring after may  this statement rescinds or amends several existing statements related to the extinguishment of debt  intangible assets of motor carriers  certain lease transactions and several other technical corrections to existing pronouncements

dependence on legacy products  recently introduced products and new product development 
the company s future results of operations are highly dependent on market acceptance of existing and future applications for both the company s wansuite family of integrated access devices and new integrated access system products in development 
the majority of sales continue to be provided by the company s legacy products  primarily the as product line which represented approximately of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal sales of wansuite products represented approximately and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the company anticipates that net sales of its legacy products will continue to shrink as newly introduced products by the company and its competitors capture market share 
market acceptance of both the company s current and future product lines is dependent on a number of factors  not all of which are in the company s control  including the continued growth in the use of bandwidth intensive applications  continued deployment of new telecommunications services  market acceptance of integrated access devices and systems in general  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success of the company s sales and marketing efforts 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  continuing improvements in telecommunication service offerings  and changing demands of the company s customer base 
failure to introduce new products in a timely manner could cause companies to purchase products from competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to a variety of factors  the company may experience delays in developing its planned products 
new products may require additional development work  enhancement and testing or further refinement before the company can make them commercially available 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products  product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as changes in customer requirements 
such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if the company s products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  then the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
continued listing requirements and deficiency notification 
the company s common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
for continued listing  the nasdaq smallcap market requires  among other things  that listed securities maintain a minimum bid price of not less than per share 
nasdaq has notified the company that it has failed to maintain this continued listing requirement  and will commence procedures to delist its securities from the nasdaq smallcap market unless the company has regained compliance with this listing requirement by february  if  at anytime before february   the bid price of the company s common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive trading days  the company will regain compliance with the continued listing requirements 
if delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  the company s common stock may be eligible for trading on the otc bulletin board or on other over the counter markets  although there can be no assurance that the company s common stock will be eligible for trading on any alternative exchanges or markets 
among other consequences  moving from the nasdaq smallcap market  or delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market may cause a decline in the stock price  reduced liquidity in the trading market for the common stock  and difficulty in obtaining future financing 
customer concentration 
a small number of customers continue to account for a majority of the company s sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel networks and interlink communications systems accounted for and of the company s net sales  respectively  and the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel networks accounted for of the company s net sales  and net sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel networks and worldcom accounted for and of the company s net sales  respectively  and net sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
other than nortel networks  interlink communications systems and worldcom  no customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal years  or on a quarterly basis in fiscal  net sales to nortel networks of legacy products has accounted for as much as of the company s net sales that quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
the economic climate and conditions in the telecommunication equipment industry are expected to remain unpredictable in fiscal and worldcom filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in july a bankruptcy filing by one or more of the company s other major customers would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain customers of the company have been or may be acquired by other existing customers 
the impact of such acquisitions on net sales to such customers is uncertain  but there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will not result in a reduction in net sales to those customers 
in addition  such acquisitions could have in the past and could in the future  result in further concentration of the company s customers 
the company has in the past experienced significant declines in net sales it believes were in part related to orders being delayed or cancelled as a result of pending acquisitions relating to its customers 
there can be no assurance that future merger and acquisition activity among the company s customers will not have a similar adverse affect on the company s net sales and results of operations 
the company s customers are typically not contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period 
product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period 
in some cases  major customers have abruptly terminated purchases of the company s products 
loss of  or a material reduction in orders by  one or more of the company s major customers would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see competition and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of its executive officers and key management  sales  and technical personnel 
the company is a party to agreements with its executive officers to help ensure the officer s continual service to the company in the event of a change in control 
each of the company s executive officers  and key management  sales and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
the company implemented significant cost and staff reductions during fiscal  which may make it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key personnel  or the inability to attract qualified personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the company s busine ss  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key suppliers and component availability 
the company generally relies upon contract manufacturers to buy finished goods for certain product families and component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies used in its products 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
currently  the company and third party sub contractors depend upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company has historically obtained several components and licenses for certain embedded software from single or limited sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company and third party sub contractors requirements for any such components 
the company and third party sub contractors generally do not have an y long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
any loss in a key supplier  increase in required lead times  increase in prices of component parts  interruption in the supply of any of these components  or the inability of the company or its third party sub contractor to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of any of the company s outside contractors could cause a delay in the company s ability to fulfill orders while the company identifies a replacement contractor 
because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties  including those relating to payment terms  cost of manufacturing  adequacy of manufacturing capacity  quality control  and timeliness of delivery  the company is unable to predict whether such relationships would be on terms that the company regards as satisfactory 
any significant disruption in the company s relationships with its manufacturing sources would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
purchase orders from the company s customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
as the company does not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
the company uses internal forecasts to manage its general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms  and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  the company may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices or termination of contracts 
from time to time  the company has experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations may occ ur in the future  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors resulting in more variability and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
for example  sales to nortel networks during the last two fiscal years have varied between quarters by as much as million  and order volatility by this customer had a significant impact on the company in fiscal most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times 
the company s ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the company has experienced large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
the company s sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment deployment projects 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by the third party subcontractors the company is using to outsource its manufacturing operations as well as by other vendors of components used in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the company s products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services and products 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
the company believes that sales in the past have been adversely impacted by merger activities by some of its top customers 
in addition  the company has experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect the com pany s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration and dependence on key suppliers and component availability 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve its sales objectives  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with certain of its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company in certain periods 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the comp any s operating results and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 
the company s industry is characterized by declining prices of existing products  and therefore continual improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products are required to maintain gross margins 
in response to customer demands or competitive pressures  or to pursue new product or market opportunities  the company may take certain pricing or marketing actions  such as price reductions  volume discounts  or provision of services at below market rates 
these actions could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of factors  particularly delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a certain extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company has had  and in some future quarter may have operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see potential volatility of stock price 
the company s products are covered by warranties and the company is subject to contractual commitments concerning its products 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that the product does not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
company specific factors or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experi enced significant fluctuations in its stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
competition 
the market for telecommunications network access equipment is characterized as highly competitive with price erosions on aging technologies 
this market  in the past  has been subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments and new entrants 
the market for integrated access devices  such as the access system and wansuite product lines  and for enterprise termination devices  such as the prism product line  is subject to rapid change 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in this market are the development and rapid introduction of products based on new technologies  high product value in price versus performance comparisons  support for multiple types of communication services  increased network monitoring and control  product reliability  and quality of customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products and future p roducts will be able to compete successfully with respect to these or other factors 
the company s principal competition for its current product offerings are adtran  inc  paradyne inc  kentrox owned by platinum equity holdings  vina technologies  inc  quick eagle networks  larscom  inc 
and cisco systems  inc for access routing with integrated wan interface cards wic s 
industry consolidation could lead to competition with fewer  but stronger competitors 
in addition  advanced termination products are emerging  which represent both new market opportunities  as well as a threat to the company s current products 
furthermore  basic line termination functions are increasingly being integrated by competitors  such as cisco  lucent technologies  inc and nortel networks  into other equipment such as routers and switches 
these include direct wan interfaces in certain products  which may erode the addressable market for separate network termination products 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to the company s products and planned products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the market for basic network termination products is mature and that margins are eroding  but the market for feature enhanced network termination and high bandwidth network access products may continue to grow and expand  as more capability and intelligence moves outward from the central office to the enterprise 
the company expects emerging broadband standards and technologies like g 
shdsl  atm  ethernet and ip services to start the next wave of spending in this market as carriers and enterprises update services to the network edge 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have long established relationships with network service providers 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
see factors affecting future results competition 
rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
the company may need to supplement its internal expertise and resources with specialized expertise or intellectual property from third parties to develop new products 
the development of new products for the wan access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as dsl  isdn  frame relay  atm and ip 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products that meet industry standards for safety  emissions and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delays due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products  or that any such products will be responsiv e to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the company were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 
see dependence on recently introduced products and new product development 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
standards for new services such as frame relay  performance monitoring services and dsl have evolved  such as the g 
shdsl standard 
as standards continue to evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develo p and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and therefore are expected to affect demand for such services and the telecommunications products that support such services 
tariff rates  whether determined by network service providers or in response to regulatory directives  may affect the cost effectiveness of deploying communication services 
such policies also affect demand for telecommunications equipment  including the company s products 
risks associated with potential acquisitions and joint ventures 
an important element of the company s historical strategy has been to review acquisition prospects and joint venture opportunities that would complement its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities or offer growth opportunities 
transactions of this nature by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurring of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and or the price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
joint ventures entail risks such as potential conflicts of interest and disputes among the participants  difficulties in integrating technologies and personnel  and risks of entering new markets 
the company s management has limited prior experience in assimilating such transactions 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future or to successfully develop any products or technologies that might be contemplated by any future joint venture or similar arrangement  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company to date has had minimal direct sales to customers outside of north america 
the company has little experience in the european and far eastern markets  but intends to expand sales of its products outside of north america and to enter certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of north america is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any company sales are denominated in foreign currency  the company s sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency e xchange rates 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the related patent is issued and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  could relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company may receive communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
limited protection of intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
the company has been issued certain us and canadian patents with respect to limited aspects of its single purpose network access technology 
the company has not obtained significant patent protection for its access system or wansuite technologies 
there can be no assurance that third parties have not or will not develop equivalent technologies or products without infringing the company s patents or that a court having jurisdiction over a dispute involving such patents would hold the company s patents valid  enforceable and infringed 
the company also typically enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and inde pendent contractors  and non disclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus  make the possibility of misappropriation of the company s technology and products more likely 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company is subject to interest rate risks on its long term debt 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the additional interest expense would not be material 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material
