in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement  the partnership is no longer authorized to originate or acquire insured mortgages and  consequently  its primary objective is to manage its portfolio of mortgage investments  all of which are insured as discussed below under section d or section of the national housing act of  as amended the national housing act 
the partnership is a liquidating partnership and as it continues to liquidate its mortgage investments and investors receive distributions of return of capital and taxable gains  investors should expect a reduction in earnings and distributions due to the decreasing mortgage base 
the partnership agreement states that the partnership will terminate on december   unless previously terminated under the provisions of the partnership agreement 
most of the insured mortgages held by the partnership apply to the section program of the national housing act of  as amended the section program 
under the section program  a mortgagee has the right to assign a mortgage put to fha at the expiration of years from the date of final endorsement if the mortgage is not in default at such time 
any mortgagee electing to assign an fha insured mortgage to fha will receive  in exchange therefor  united states department of housing and urban development hud debentures having a total face value equal to the then outstanding principal balance of the fha insured mortgage plus accrued interest to the date of assignment 
these hud debentures will mature years from the date of assignment and will bear interest at the going federal rate at such date 
this assignment procedure is applicable to an insured mortgage which had a firm or conditional fha commitment for insurance on or before november  the partnership anticipates that each eligible insured mortgage  for which a prepayment has not occurred and which has not been sold  will be assigned to fha at the expiration of years from the date of final endorsement 
the partnership  therefore  does not anticipate holding any eligible insured mortgage beyond the expiration of years from final endorsement of that insured mortgage

the mortgages underlying the fha insured certificates and fha insured loans are non recourse first liens on multifamily residential developments 
as of december   the partnership had invested in insured mortgages  with an aggregate amortized cost of approximately million  a face value of approximately million and a fair value of approximately million  as discussed below 
the following is a discussion of the types of the partnership s mortgage investments  along with the risks related to each type of investment investment in fha insured loans listed below is the partnership s aggregate investment in fha insured loans as of december  and december  number of acquired insured mortgages originated insured mortgage amortized cost   face value   fair value   all of the fha insured loans were current with respect to the payment of principal and interest as of march  investment in fha insured certificates listed below is the partnership s aggregate investment in fha insured certificates as of december  and december  number of mortgages amortized cost   face value   fair value   in september  the mortgage on berryhill apartments was prepaid

asset management fee to related parties decreased for as compared to primarily due to a reduction in the mortgage base  as previously discussed

the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  are the partnership s principal sources of cash flows  and were sufficient for the years ended december   and to meet operating requirements 
the partnership anticipates its cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expense requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages after paying all expenses of the partnership 
although insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each period due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base resulting from monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance of insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease 
the magnitude of the decrease will depend upon the size of the insured mortgages  which are prepaid  sold or assigned for insurance proceeds 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to did not change significantly 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to  due to the increase in proceeds received from the disposition of mortgages  as previously discussed 
net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to due to an increase in distributions paid to partners 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to an increase in the change in due from affiliate  receivables and other assets 
this change is primarily due to the timing of the receipt of interest on debentures received from affiliate 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to  due to the decrease in proceeds from mortgage dispositions and a decrease in debenture proceeds received from affiliate 
net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to due to a decrease in distributions paid to partners as a result of decreases discussed above
