item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared with net sales increased to  million in as compared to  million for the previous year 
two factors that impacted revenues during were 
the volume of tons sold increased by percent from million tons in to million tons in this increase consisted of a percent increase in utility tons sold and a percent increase in industrial tons sold  offset in part by a decrease of percent in metallurgical tons sold 

the average per ton realized price for coal sold increased by percent from in to in the market for utility coal continued to improve during the fiscal year as spot market prices of central appalachian coal increased to year highs 
unfortunately  most of the massey tonnage sold in was committed prior to the upturn in the market 
other revenue  which consists of royalties  rentals  miscellaneous income and gains on the sale of non strategic assets  decreased percent to million for compared with million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income from dispositions of non strategic mineral reserves  which generated million in compared to million in as part of its management of coal reserves  massey regularly sells non strategic reserves or exchanges them for reserves located in more synergistic locations 
cost of sales increased percent to  million for from million in this was partially due to the increase in tons sold 
cost of sales on a per ton sold basis increased by percent to for the fiscal year compared to in fiscal this increase in cost was related to both the direct cost of labor and the decreases in productivity resulting from a greater percentage of inexperienced miners 
this was due  in part  to the company s efforts to increase production 
in addition  heavy rains in southern west virginia in july increased employee absenteeism and disrupted loading operations and rail service  slowing coal shipping 
other operational problems impacted production and costs throughout the fiscal year 
operating difficulties and problematic geologic conditions were encountered at several longwall mines and during the expansion of massey s two large surface mines  where we experienced higher than expected overburden ratios in the first half of the year 
the ellis eagle longwall mine experienced flooding that caused significant disruption to coal production during april and may 
the flooding caused reduced shipments from both the marfork and goals preparation plants 
increases in operating costs related to the martin county coal slurry spill and the idling of the martin county coal preparation plant from october   to april   also negatively impacted cost of sales 
cost of sales for and includes credits of million and million  respectively  related to refunds of black lung excise taxes paid on coal export sales tonnage 
black lung excise taxes on exported coal were determined to be unconstitutional by a federal district court decision 
during  the internal revenue service substantially completed its audit of the company s requested refund of black lung excise tax payments 
cost of sales in also includes a million benefit arising from the settlement of insurance claims from the august upper cedar grove longwall failure 
depreciation  depletion and amortization slightly increased to million for from million in the increase of million was primarily due to the level of capital expenditures in recent years 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million for compared with million for this was due in part to a million bad debt expense in associated with the bankruptcy of a major steel industry customer as well as a reduction in accruals related to long term executive compensation plans  partially offset by additions to the administrative workforce associated with running a stand alone publicly traded company 
interest income decreased to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of the company s loans with fluor corporation in connection with the spin off transaction on november  additionally  in the second quarter of  million was accrued for interest due on the black lung excise tax refund as noted above  while in the third fiscal quarter of  million was accrued for interest on the black lung excise tax refund 
interest expense increased to million for the increase was due to the addition of the percent senior notes and commercial paper borrowings subsequent to the spin off 
income tax benefit was million for compared to an income tax expense of million for this primarily reflects the loss before taxes for compared to income before taxes for  as well as a depletion accounting income tax benefit of million in compared with net sales remained essentially unchanged in compared with net sales were  million in compared with  million for three factors that impacted revenues during were 
the volume of steam coal sold increased by percent in compared to 
the volume of the higher priced metallurgical coal declined by percent in compared to 
the average realized prices for both steam and metallurgical coal declined by percent in compared with the metallurgical coal market continued to be adversely affected by a weak coal export market and the slow recovery of the domestic steel market 
demand was weak for united states coal exported to foreign markets as the us dollar remained strong 
the market for steam coal continued to be adversely impacted by two factors mild weather and competition from western coals  which increased its penetration of traditional eastern coal market areas 
other revenue  which consists of royalties  rentals  miscellaneous income and gains on the sale of non strategic assets  increased percent to million for compared with million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in income from dispositions of non strategic mineral reserves which generated million in compared with million in as part of its management of coal reserves  massey regularly sells non strategic reserves or exchanges them for reserves located in more synergistic locations 
cost of sales increased percent to million for from million in this was primarily due to the increase in tons sold by percent from million tons in to million tons in cost of sales for includes a million credit related to refunds of black lung excise taxes paid on coal export sales tonnage 
the payment of black lung excise taxes on exported coal was determined to be unconstitutional by a federal district court decision 
during  the internal revenue service issued procedures for obtaining refunds related to such excise taxes 
cost of sales also included charges of million related to a geological impairment related to the longwall development at the upper cedar grove mine and a million charge related to a slurry spill from the impoundment breach at martin county coal corporation 
cost of sales on a per ton of coal sold basis  excluding the aforementioned items  increased by approximately percent in compared with as operational problems and adverse geologic conditions encountered during the third and fourth quarters of more than offset cost reductions that had been achieved in the first two quarters of depreciation  depletion and amortization slightly increased to million for from million in the increase of million was primarily due to capital expenditures made in recent years 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to million for compared with million for  due in part to a million bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of a major steel industry customer offset some by a reduction in accruals related to long term executive compensation plans 
interest income increased to million for compared with million for this increase of million was primarily due to the additional interest income of million related to the black lung excise tax refunds discussed above and a general increase in the floating interest rate on a note receivable from fluor corporation 
income taxes decreased percent to million for compared with million in the decrease primarily reflects the decreased earnings in compared with  partially offset by a rise in the effective tax rate to percent for compared with percent for liquidity and capital resources at october   the company s available liquidity was million  including cash and cash equivalents of million and million remaining on the company s commercial paper program 
at october   massey had million of consolidated commercial paper outstanding commercial paper of million net of discount offset by million of massey commercial paper purchased by various massey subsidiaries included in short term debt 
in order to participate in the commercial paper market  the company must maintain an investment grade rating as determined by both moody s and standard poor s  national rating agencies 
failure to maintain this rating would most likely result in increased interest expense  as the company would be required to draw on its available liquidity backstop 
on the date of the spin off  massey entered into million day and million year revolving credit facilities  which have been guaranteed by a 
t 
massey  that serve to provide liquidity backstop to massey s commercial paper program and are also available to meet the company s ongoing liquidity needs 
the million day facility has been renewed through november  borrowings under these facilities bear interest based on i the london interbank offer rate libor plus a margin  which is based on the company s credit rating as determined by moody s and standard poor s  ii the base rate as defined in the facility agreements  and iii the competitive bid rate as defined in the facility agreements 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities at october  the revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain various financial ratios 
failure by the company to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the financial covenants consist of a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio  and a minimum net worth test 
the leverage ratio requires that the company not permit the ratio of total indebtedness at the end of any quarter to adjusted ebitda for the four quarters then ended to exceed a specific amount 
the interest coverage ratio requires that the company not permit the ratio of the company s adjusted ebitda to interest expense for the four quarters then ended to be less than a specified amount 
the net worth test requires that the company not permit its net worth to be less than a specified amount 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at october  the company expects that it was not in compliance with the covenant related to the leverage ratio at december   however  the participant banks have granted a temporary waiver of this financial covenant 
the waiver expires on february  the company is seeking to obtain an amendment to the covenant level prior to the expiration of the waiver and expects approval by the participant banks 
if the company is unable to obtain an amendment to the covenant level  it would most likely result in the company seeking alternate sources of short term financing  or issuing longer term debt  which the company has available a million debt shelf registration originally filed with the securities and exchange commission by fluor corporation in march the total debt to book capitalization ratio was percent at october  the cash flow provided by operating activities was million in and million for the same period in cash provided by operating activities reflects net earnings adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital requirements 
net cash utilized in investing activities was million in  and million in the cash used in investing activities reflects capital expenditures in the amount of million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures are for replacement of mining equipment  the expansion of mining capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of mining operations 
financing activities primarily reflect changes in amounts due from fluor corporation and other capital accounts associated with the spin off transaction and being a publicly traded company 
in addition to the cash spent on capital expenditures during the year of  the company leased  through operating leases  million and million of mining equipment in and  respectively 
massey believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and anticipated dividend payments for at least the next several years 
nevertheless  the ability of massey to satisfy its debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond massey s control 
massey frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
in the past  massey has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations  but massey may consider a variety of other sources  depending on the size of any transaction  including debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital resources will be available to massey on terms which massey finds acceptable  or at all 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on massey s results of operations for the years presented 
new accounting standards effective november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statements require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the adoption of these accounting standards and subsequent implementation guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
as part of ongoing accounting operations  management will continue to assess its financial instruments and activities for identification of transactions subject to the treatment of sfas and all related guidance 
on august   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard will require that retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on the present value of the estimated cash flows 
this sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and transition is by cumulative catch up adjustment 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its financial statements 
outlook massey expects a loss in the two month stub period between october  fiscal year end and the january  beginning of its first calendar fiscal year due to a number of operational and non operational issues 
mild weather  softening steel demand and the general economic recession have also caused massey to lower its earlier estimate of central appalachian coal demand 
notwithstanding  production and profitability are expected to improve significantly over fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk massey s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at october   massey had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments  however  the company s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its commercial paper program 
at october   massey had million of aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding million net of discount 
at october  massey s commercial paper bore interest at an average rate of percent 
based on the commercial paper balance outstanding at october   a basis point increase in the average issuance rate for massey s commercial paper would increase massey s annual interest expense by approximately million 
almost all of massey s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks
