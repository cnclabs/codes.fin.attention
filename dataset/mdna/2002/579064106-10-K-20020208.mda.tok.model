table of contents overview we are a leading supplier of network security and network management solutions 
we operate through two businesses consisting of our infrastructure business and mcafee 
com  our publicly traded subsidiary 
each business operates in one industry computer security  management  and availability software  hardware and related services for  primarily  consumer  corporate and government users 
our infrastructure business is operated in six geographic regions the united states  europe  japan  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
to more effectively market our infrastructure business products in these geographic regions  we have combined complementary products into three product groups mcafee  sniffer technologies and magic 
mcafee 
com is an asp targeted at consumers and small to medium sized businesses 
pgp integration and disposition 
in the fourth quarter of  we substantially completed integrating the activities of our pgp product group into our mcafee and sniffer product groups 
in  the pgp product group accounted for approximately of net revenue 
we are seeking buyers for the pgp desktop encryption and gauntlet firewall products 
in connection with the pgp integration  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of  consisting primarily of the costs related to severance packages for affected employees 
related to this integration  we also expect  among other things to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately million related to the divestiture of those pgp security products that were not integrated into our sniffer and mcafee product groups  expense reductions of up to approximately million in  primarily in the areas of cost of services and support  research and development  marketing and sales and to a lesser extent  general and administrative expenses  and overall revenue to be adversely impacted in at least the near term due to  among other things  possible uncertainty on the part of those customers purchasing the pgp security products being sold 
change in distributor business model 
we market a significant portion of our products to end users through intermediaries  including distributors 
in december  in light of the business decision by some of our distributors  including our largest distributor  to reduce inventory levels  and due to the unpredictability of demand in the distribution channel  we began a transition from a sell in to a sell through business model 
commencing january   we moved to the sell through business model for each distributor 
under this model  we recognize revenue on products sold to distributors when the products are resold by the distributor to their customers 
results reported for the quarter and year ended december   include a significant reduction to net revenue due to some our distribution partners business decision to reduce their inventory levels by not replenishing their inventory and requesting returns over and above their contractual rights 
under the terms of their distribution agreements at that time  our distributors had title to  and risk of loss with respect to  the distributor inventory subject to these requested returns 
as of december   goods that were held by our distributors and not subject to a returns allowance totaled million

we may experience higher overall revenue in the near term but lower future software license revenue due to increased levels of perpetual licenses 
sales of perpetual licenses typically result in significantly higher up front revenue and lower recurring and future revenues as the sales price for related upgrades and updates tends to be significantly lower than that of the initial perpetual license

table of contents critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales returns and other allowances  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue  which includes software license  hardware and royalty revenue  and ii services and support revenue which includes software license maintenance  training  consulting and hosting arrangements revenue 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we license our software products on a one and two year time basis or on a perpetual basis 
our two year time based licenses include the first year of maintenance and support 
our hosting arrangements require customers to pay a fixed fee and receive service over a period of time  generally one or two years 
customers do not pay any set up fee 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we do not bifurcate the fee and we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
for hardware transactions where no software is involved we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition 
in addition  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware to our hosted software service transactions 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  except those completed over the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to network associates 
this means that we defer revenue from the 
table of contents arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for both our two year time based licenses and perpetual licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  we assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and litigation 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for sales returns and other allowances amounted to million in similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have 
table of contents recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of 
table of contents its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in cumulative translation adjustments 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly we had cumulative translation losses of approximately million and million which were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss within our balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
during  and  translation adjustments of million  million and million  respectively  were included under accumulated other comprehensive loss 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar  these losses would have increased our loss for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the japanese yen  the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling and australian and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives 
eitf issue no 
addresses the recognition  measurement  and income statement classification for sales incentives that a vendor voluntarily offers to customers without charge  which the customer can use in  or exercise as a result of  a single exchange transaction 
sales incentives that fall within the scope of eitf issue no 
include offers that a customer can use to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service at the point of sale 
the eitf agreed to change the transition date for issue  dictating that a company should apply this consensus no later than the company s annual or interim financial statements for the periods beginning after december  in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  effective for periods beginning after december  eitf issue no 
addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is a an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be included as a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations 
upon application of these eitfs  financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes should be reclassified to comply with the income statement display requirements under these issues

we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of these issues on our financial statements 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill  we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in addition we will be required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step we will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we expect to complete this review during the first quarter of we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge may not be recorded

sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  for a combined total of million 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from net income before non cash charges and minority interest 
non cash charges include depreciation  amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  interest on our zero coupon convertible debentures  stock based compensation charges  write down of our strategic investments  net gains on investments and extraordinary items 
after excluding the effects of non cash charges  our net income was approximately million during additional cash was 
table of contents generated from an increase of million in our deferred revenue balance which results from deferral  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  of a portion of fees received from our customers 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in our other net working capital balances  primarily an increase in our accounts receivable of million in offset by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities balance of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from increases in our deferred revenue resulting from the deferral of a portion of fees received from our customers in our sales arrangements 
before non cash charges  our net loss was million during net cash used in operating activities in resulted primarily from decrease in deferred revenue and changes in deferred tax assets which was partly offset by a decrease in our other net working capital generated by a combined reduction of accounts receivable and increase in accounts payable 
before non cash charges  our cash basis net loss was million during our accounts receivable balance as a percentage of sales may increase due to our increased emphasis on large accounts and expanding international sales  both of which typically have longer payment terms 
additionally  our receivable collection has become more dependent on the longer payment cycle for vars  distributors and system integrators 
to address this increase in accounts receivable and to improve cash flow  we may from time to time take actions to encourage earlier payment of receivables or sell receivables 
during  and  we sold receivables aggregating approximately million  million and zero  respectively 
these receivables were sold at a customary discount of up to of face amount without recourse to us 
the discounts were recorded as an operating expense 
as of december  and  no receivables sold in and  as applicable  remained outstanding 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we will be subject to greater credit risk with respect thereto 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  primarily reflecting transactions in marketable securities and additions to fixed assets 
in  the activity in the portfolio of our investment in marketable securities generated net cash proceeds of million 
this proceeds were offset by our purchase of shares of our japanese subsidiary owned by minority stockholders for million and by our purchases of fixed assets and technologies totaling million 
in  we obtained cash proceeds of million and million from the sale of our shares in goto 
com and the sale of less than of our shares in our japanese subsidiary  respectively 
our disbursements related to purchases of fixed assets  technologies and other investments for a total of million were partly offset by net cash proceeds of million from the activity in our investment portfolio 
net cash provided by financing activities in amounted to million  primarily consisting of issuance of convertible notes for million  as well as issuance of common stock under our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan for million 
in addition  as described below  we settled all outstanding put options for a payment of approximately million in february these proceeds were offset by our repurchase of zero coupon convertible debentures for million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in consisting primarily of the repurchase of our common stock which represented approximately million 
the repurchases of our common stock were slightly offset by proceeds associated with the exercise of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan including the sale of put options  for a total of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in consisting primarily of the proceeds from mcafee 
com s initial public offering for million as well as proceeds associated with the exercise of our stock options and sale of put options  for a total of million 
these proceeds were offset by the disbursements we made to purchase back some of our common stock and repay notes payable 
during  a significant portion of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly  as a result of decrease in customer demand or decrease in the acceptance of our future products  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 

table of contents future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december in thousands zero coupon convertible non convertible subordinated cancelable debentures due notes due operating leases total and thereafter as discussed below  in february  we may be required to use a significant portion of our cash balance to redeem our outstanding zero coupon debentures 
the redemption value corresponds to the aggregate face value outstanding of million less the related unamortized discount of million on february  in    and  we will make interest payments of million 
we believe that our available cash and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
convertible debt on february   we issued zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due  which have an aggregate face amount at maturity of million and generated net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting fees and expenses 
the initial price for the debentures was per  of principal amount at maturity 
at the option of the holder  we are required to redeem the debentures as of february   february  and february  at purchase prices equal to the initial issue price plus the accretion of the discount on the debentures to such dates or  and per  of principal amount at maturity  respectively 
in the case of such a required redemption  at our option  we may pay the aggregate redemption price in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock 
the number of shares of common stock so issued by us would be based on the fair value of our common stock at the time of any required redemption 
on the same dates and at the same redemption prices  we may at our option redeem the outstanding debentures for cash 
the debentures may also be redeemed at the option of the holder if there is a fundamental change as defined in the related indenture at a price equal to the issue price plus the accretion of the discount on the debenture to the date of redemption  subject to adjustment 
the accretion of the discount on the debentures is calculated using the effective interest method 
during  we redeemed zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures  which had an aggregate face amount at maturity of million  at a net price of million  which was financed from the company s investment portfolio 
in connection with the redemption  we recognized an extraordinary gain of approximately million  net of approximately million in taxes 
if and when appropriate opportunities present themselves  we may use a portion of our cash balances to buy back additional amounts of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures 
as of december   our aggregate cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million  including million held by mcafee 
com 
assuming that as of february  all currently outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures are redeemed  the aggregate redemption price would equal approximately million 
on august   we issued convertible subordinated notes due with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the issuance generated net proceeds to us of approximately million

interest is payable semi annually in cash in arrears on february and august of each year  commencing february  at the option of the holder  the notes may be converted into our common stock at any time  unless previously redeemed  at a conversion price of per share 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after august  at a redemption price of of the principal amount between august  and august  and of the principal amount after august  the notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness as defined in the related indenture and are pari passu with respect to the zero coupon subordinated debentures due derivatives we conduct our operations globally 
consequently the results of our operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce exposures associated with nonfunctional currency accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in euros  canadian and australian dollars and several european currencies 
the forward contracts range from one to three months in original maturity 
in general  we do not hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows nor do we enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not use any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly are marked to market at the end of each reporting period with any unrealized gain or loss being recognized in the statement of operations

euro on january   the euro was introduced 
on that day  the exchange ratios of the currencies of the eleven countries participating in the first phase of the european economic and monetary union were fixed 
the euro became a currency in its own right and the currencies of the participating countries  while continuing to exist for a three year transition period  are now fixed denominations of the euro 
the conversion to the euro will have significant effects on the foreign exchange markets and bond markets and is requiring significant changes in the operations and systems within the european banking industry 
our information system is designed to accommodate multi currency environments 
as a result  we have the flexibility to transact business with vendors and customers in either euro or traditional national currency units 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in japan  canada  australia  europe  latin america  and asia 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the japanese yen  canadian dollar  australian dollar  the euro and certain european currencies 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
we also maintain minority investments in private and publicly traded companies 
these investments are reviewed for other than temporary declines in value on a quarterly basis 
reasons for other than temporary declines in value include whether the related company would have insufficient cash flow to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the operating performance or operating model and changes in market conditions 
as of december   the minority venture investments we continue to hold totaled million at estimated fair value 
the million in minority venture investments include investments in public and private companies  amounting to million and  respectively 
during  we recorded a million impairment charge in connection with these investments
