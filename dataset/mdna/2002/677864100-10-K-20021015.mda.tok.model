expectations the company anticipates that sales should be down to compared to fiscal the impact of the company s decision to restructure its private label supply arrangement with wal mart will reduce sales  but should increase profits 
additional sales reductions may occur due to continued product and geographical rationalization 
during the second half of fiscal  the company s overburden removal cost at its georgia facility should return to more historical levels  positively impacting profitability

liquidity needs have been  and are expected to be  met through internally generated funds and  to the extent needed  borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility with harris trust and savings 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions  limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to acquire  build or dispose of assets and to pay dividends 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations 
however  should new facility construction or acquisition occur  it is possible that additional borrowings of a long term nature will be required outside the existing credit facility 
the company s ability to fund operations  make planned capital expenditures  including new facility construction  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements depends on its future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of july  however  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the company employs policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material 
the company is exposed to commodity price risk with respect to natural gas 
the company has contracted for a significant portion of its fuel needs for fiscal using forward purchase contracts to manage the volatility related to this exposure 
no contracts were entered into for speculative purposes 
these contracts will reduce the volatility in fuel prices  and the weighted average cost of these contracts have been estimated to be approximately lower than the contracts for fiscal the table below provides information about the company s natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected fair maturity value natural gas future volumes mmbtu s  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors which could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the overall general economy  developments in world events  the general demand of natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed the company to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts  by the continued and in some cases expanded use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on the company s fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market
