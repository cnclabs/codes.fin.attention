this discussion includes forward looking statements  such as our projections about future results of operations which are inherently uncertain 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those discussed in factors affecting future results in this document 
overview interwoven was incorporated in march  to provide software products and services for enterprise content management 
the information technology industry refers to this process as enterprise content management 
our software products and services help customers automate the process of developing  managing and deploying content used in business applications 
our products are designed to allow all content contributors within an organization to create  manage and deploy content assets  such as documents  xml html  rich media  database content and application code 
from march through march  we were a development stage company conducting research and development for our initial products 
in may  we shipped the first version of our principal product  teamsite 
we have subsequently developed and released enhanced versions of teamsite and have introduced related products to compliment our enterprise content management offerings 
as of december   we had sold our products and services to over customers 
we market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force and augment our sales efforts through relationships with systems integrators and other strategic partners 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california and maintain additional offices in the metropolitan areas of atlanta  austin  boston  chicago  columbus  dallas  los angeles  new york city  san francisco  seattle and washington  dc our revenues to date have been derived primarily from accounts in north america 
in addition  we have offices in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  hong kong  italy  japan  mexico  netherlands  norway  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we had employees as of december  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and services organizations  and to establish our administrative organization 
as a result  we incurred net losses through december  and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we experienced a sequential decline in our revenues during due to the current economic slowdown that has resulted in a substantial reduction in overall spending in information technology initiatives 
we expect the current economic slowdown to affect our business through the first half of and perhaps longer 
due to our effort to align our revenues with our expenses  we will continue to make a concerted effort to manage such costs 
in light of the current economic slowdown and as a result of these cost management efforts  we do not anticipate a significant increase in our expenses in the foreseeable future 
additionally  due to our limited operating history and the weakness of the current economic environment generally  the prediction of future results of operations over the long term is difficult and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability  however  we anticipate only moderate growth  if any  in our overall revenues in we have generally made business decisions with reference to net profit metrics excluding non cash charges  for example  acquisition and stock based compensation charges 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions  incur stock based compensation and intangible amortization charges  which will increase our losses inclusive of these non cash expenses 
we provide supplemental consolidated financial information within our related filings with securities and exchange commission  earnings releases and investor conference calls 
the supplemental consolidated financial information excludes from our earnings and earnings per share the effects of certain expenses such as the amortization of goodwill and intangibles  stock based compensation  the write off of in process research and development and a special charge associated with the relocation of our facilities 
this supplemental consolidated financial information is reported as pro forma earnings and earnings per share in addition to information that is reported based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
we believe that such pro forma operating results better reflects our operational performance as it provides a more meaningful measure of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge readers to review and consider carefully the gaap financial information contained within our filings with the sec and in our earnings releases 
critical accounting policies and judgments revenue recognition we derive revenues from the license of our software products and from services that we provide to our customers 
to date  we have derived the majority of our license revenues from licenses of teamsite 
we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
based on these accounting standards  we recognize revenue under what is commonly referred to as the residual method 
under the residual method  for agreements that have multiple deliverables multiple element arrangements eg software products  services  support  etc  revenue is recognized based on company specific objective evidence of fair value for all of the delivered elements 
our specific objective evidence of fair value is determined by consistent pricing and collections of an item when it has been sold separately in the past 
once we have established the fair value of each of the undelivered elements  the dollar value of the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements first and the residual of the amount is then allocated to the delivered elements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  maintenance  consulting  and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
at the outset of the customer arrangement  if we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with each transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond our normal payments terms  which are to days from the invoice date  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we do not offer product return rights to resellers or end users 
from inception through the fourth quarter of  the limited collection history and infancy of our international sales infrastructure led us to defer revenue until cash collection for sales occurring outside the united states 
we now believe that a more mature sales infrastructure coupled with a history of collections in several geographic regions allows us to ascertain that collectibility is probable in northern europe and australia 
therefore  beginning on january   we began to recognize revenue upon the signing of the contract and shipment of the product in these regions  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we will continue to assess the appropriateness of revenue recognition on sales agreements in other geographic locations once we have developed an adequate infrastructure and collection history in those regions 
services revenues consist of professional services and maintenance fees 
professional services primarily consist of software installation and integration  business process consulting and training 
professional services are predominantly billed on a time and materials basis and revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance agreements are typically priced based on a percentage of the product license fee and have a one year term  renewable annually 
services provided to customers under maintenance agreements include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades 
deferred revenues from advanced payments for maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically one year 
facilities relocation charges during  we recorded a million charge associated with costs of relocation of our facilities 
this charge included million in lease abandonment charges relating to the consolidation of our three facilities in the silicon valley into a single corporate location  as well as costs associated with abandoned leased facilities in austin 
these charges include the remaining lease commitments of these facilities reduced by the estimated sublease income throughout the duration of the lease term 
to determine the estimated sublease income associated with these abandoned facilities  we received independent appraisals from real estate brokers to estimate such amounts 
additionally  we evaluated operating equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the abandoned facilities to identify those assets that had suffered an impairment in their economic useful lives as a result of the relocation 
based on these evaluations  we incurred charges of million consisting of the write down of certain operating equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the abandoned facilities 
we also incurred million  through december   as a result of duplicate lease costs associated with the dual occupation of our current and our abandoned facilities 
the relocation charges are an estimate as of december  and may change as we obtain subleases for the abandoned facilities and the actual sublease income is known 
at december   payments of million had been made in connection with these charges 
at december   million had been accrued and is payable through amortization of intangibles we acquired a total of four corporations in and lexington software associates  inc  neonyoyo  inc  ajuba solutions inc  and metacode technologies  inc under us generally accepted accounting principles  we have accounted for the four business combinations using the purchase method of accounting and recorded the market value of our common stock and options issued in connection with them and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of acquiring these entities 
that cost is allocated among the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as goodwill  in process research and development  acquired technology  acquired workforce and covenants not to compete  based on their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets to goodwill 
the impact of purchase accounting on our results of operations has been significant 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles assets associated with business acquisitions was  in  million in and million in we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment include the following 
significant underperformance of operating results relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
significant negative industry or economic trends  
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and 
our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above factors  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december  during september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective for us on january  as a result of the issuance of sfas no 
 we will cease to amortize million of goodwill as of january  in lieu of amortization of goodwill  we are required to perform an initial impairment test of our goodwill in and annual impairment test thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the second quarter of we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon the completion of the initial impairment test 
however  there can be no assurances that at the time the test is completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
stock based compensation we have recorded deferred compensation liabilities related to options assumed and shares issued to effect business combinations  options granted below fair market value associated with our initial public offering in october and compensation associated with fully vested awards granted to non employees in the amount of million in and million in the following table reflects the prospective impact of all deferred compensation costs and the annual amortization of purchased intangibles other than goodwill attributable to our mergers and acquisitions that have occurred since our inception in thousands intangible assets other than goodwill    stock based compensation    the future amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired may be accelerated in the future if we reassess the value and or reduce the estimated useful life of the intangible assets 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of  and million at december  and  respectively 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts through identification of specific receivables where we expect that payment will not be received  and we have established a general reserve policy that is applied to all amounts that are not specifically identified 
in determining specific receivables where collection may not be received  we review past due receivables and give consideration to prior collection history  changes in the customer s overall business condition and the potential risk associated with the customer s industry among other factors 
we establish a general reserve for all receivable amounts that have not been specifically identified  by applying a graduated percentage to each invoice s relative aging category 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate as of the reporting dates 
changes may occur in the future  which may make us reassess the collectibility of amounts and at which time we may need to provide additional allowances in excess of that currently provided

the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license services total revenues cost of revenues license services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets in process research and development facilities relocation charges total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net loss comparison of the years ended and revenues total revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to sales to new customers in  as well as to additional sales to existing customers  reflecting greater market acceptance of our products and expanded product configurations 
our ability to attract new customers was a result of our developing a larger and more experienced sales and marketing staff and as a result of increased levels of partner influenced sales 
during the second quarter of  we began to experience a decline in demand for our products due to a world wide economic slowdown that has resulted in a substantial reduction in overall spending in information technology initiatives 
we also experienced a slight decrease in our average selling prices during  due to overall pricing pressures as well as a shift to a greater number of smaller dollar value agreements accounting for a larger percentage of our total revenue 
we expect the overall economic slowdown to adversely affect our business through the first half of and perhaps longer 
as a result  we anticipate only modest growth in our overall revenues in license 
license revenues increased from million in to million in license revenues represented and of total revenues  respectively  in those periods 
the decrease in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflects delays in customer spending and the general slowdown in the economy 
the increase in license revenues in absolute dollars reflects our growing customer base 
services 
services revenues increased from million in to million in services revenues represented and of total revenues  respectively  in those periods 
the increase in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflects a million increase in maintenance fees  a million increase in professional services fees  and a million increase in training fees 
the increased professional services and maintenance fees were due to increased demand for our products  maintenance fees earned from a larger customer base and due to an increase in the number and utilization of our professional services staff 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues includes expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and related documentation  as well as costs of licensing third party software sold in conjunction with our software products 
cost of license revenues was million in and million in cost of license revenues represented and of license revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars of cost of license revenues was attributable to an increase in royalties paid to third party software vendors commensurate with increased revenues of our products 
we expect cost of license revenues to increase in the future if our license revenues increase 
we also expect cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to vary from period to period depending primarily on the amount of royalties paid to third parties which fluctuates in each period 
services 
cost of services revenues consists primarily of salary and related costs of our professional services  training  maintenance and support personnel  and to a lesser extent  subcontractor expenses 
cost of services revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs as a result of increased staffing to meet the demand of our increased customer base 
cost of services revenues represented and of services revenues  respectively  in those periods 
the decrease in cost of services revenues as a percentage of services revenues was a result of improved productivity and greater utilization in the services organization and due to an increase in maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues which generally have a lower associated costs in providing such services 
since our services revenues have lower gross margins than our license revenues  our overall gross margins will decline if our service revenues grow faster than our license revenues 
we expect cost of services revenues as a percentage of services revenues to vary from period to period depending in part on whether the services are performed by our in house staff or by subcontractors  and on the overall utilization rates of our in house professional services staff 
the utilization of our in house staff or subcontractors is affected by the mix of services we provide  which is unpredictable 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in to million in gross profit represented of total revenues in both and this increase in absolute dollar amounts reflects increased license and services revenues from a larger customer base 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of total revenues to fluctuate from period to period primarily as a result of changes in the relative proportion of license and services revenues 
we have made and we expect to continue to make investments in our professional services organization to increase the capacity of that organization to meet the demand for services from our customers 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs to support product development activities 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  representing and of total revenues  respectively  in those periods 
this increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase in allocated expenses such as rent and deprecation and due to an increase in personnel costs of our product development personnel as a result of increased staffing 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our strategic objectives  and we expect the dollar amounts of research and development expenses to increase in future periods 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by research and development expenses will fluctuate from period to period depending primarily on when we hire new research and development personnel and secondarily on the size and timing of product development projects and revenue fluctuations 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  representing and of total revenues in those periods  respectively 
this increase in absolute dollar amounts primarily relates to increases in sales and marketing personnel costs as a result of increased staffing of our sales and marketing departments  and secondarily increased marketing related costs associated with brand awareness initiatives and other promotional efforts 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects total revenue increasing more rapidly than sales expenses and a reduced rate of spending on marketing programs as a result of the current economic slowdown 
we are endeavoring to control  and possibly reduce  our sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars throughout the current economic slowdown 
we anticipate that with evidence of a sustained recovery of the us economy  we would continue to invest in order to expand our customer base and increase brand awareness 
we also anticipate that the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate from period to period depending primarily on when we hire new sales personnel  the timing of new marketing programs and the levels of revenues in each period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for accounting  human resources  legal and other administrative functions  as well as provisions for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  representing of total revenues in both periods 
the increase in absolute dollar amounts was due to increased staffing of general and administrative functions to support our expanded operations 
other increases in general and administrative expenses were due to increased bad debt expense and increases in allocated expenses such as rent and depreciation 
we are endeavoring to control  and possibly reduce  our general and administrative costs in light of the current economic slowdown 
we anticipate that  with evidence of a sustained recovery of the us economy  we would continue to invest in our general and administrative infrastructure in order to support expanding operations 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by general and administrative expenses will fluctuate from period to period depending primarily on when we hire new general and administrative personnel to support expanding operations as well as the size and timing of expansion projects 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million and million for stock options granted in and stock options granted and assumed in  respectively 
in  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million in connection with granting of stock options and issuance of shares related to the acquisitions of neonyoyo  metacode technologies and ajuba solutions 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was million in and million in amortization of deferred stock based compensation is attributable to the following categories for the years ended december  and  respectively costs of sales research and development   sales and marketing   general and administrative  total   we expect amortization of deferred stock based compensation to be approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  which includes the projected variable accounting charge associated with our stock option exchange program and  which is based on the assumption that our stock price will remain unchanged in future periods as that at december  the variable component of the accounting charge for the options will be reassessed and reflected in the statement of operations for each reporting period based on the then current stock price for each period 
for example  for every one dollar in value that our stock price exceeds the adjusted exercise price of per share  we will recognize an additional million in deferred stock compensation 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in july  we recorded intangible assets of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of neonyoyo  inc goodwill related to this transaction approximated million  intangible assets related to workforce and covenants not to compete of neonyoyo  inc approximated million and in process research and development approximated million of the purchase price 
the total purchase price for this acquisition was approximately million 
the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
in october  we recorded intangible assets of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of ajuba solutions  inc including goodwill in the amount of approximately million and intangible assets related to workforce of approximately million of the purchase price 
the total purchase price for this acquisition was approximately million 
in november  we recorded intangible assets of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of metacode technologies  inc including goodwill of approximately million  intangible assets related to the workforce of metacode of approximately million and completed technology of approximately million of the purchase price 
the total purchase price for this acquisition was approximately million 
amortization of acquired intangible assets was million in and million in effective january   we will be required to adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 we will cease amortizing net goodwill of million  which includes million related to assembled workforce 
we will evaluate goodwill for impairment under the initial sfas no 
transitional impairment test requirements in the second quarter of and annually  thereafter 
as a result of this adoption  we expect amortization of acquired intangible assets to be million in and million in the original purchase price allocations for each acquisition were based on preliminary unaudited information 
subsequent to each acquisition date and upon completion of audits of each acquiree and the integration of the acquisitions  a number of adjustments have been made to the respective acquisition balance sheet assets and goodwill  including a million adjustment in respect of metacode to reduce cash and cash equivalents  and an aggregate non cash adjustment of million in respect of neonyoyo and ajuba  relating primarily to reversals of excess accruals for acquisition related expenses 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
in connection with these acquisitions  we recorded million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we will evaluate whether the respective fair values of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be less than their respective carrying values 
this process will include an analysis of estimated cash flows that we expect to generate from future operations for purposes of determining whether an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of these assets would be written down to their fair values as a charge against our operating results in the period that the determination is made 
a significant impairment would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
facilities relocation charges 
we recorded a million charge in  associated with costs of relocating our facilities 
these charges included million in lease abandonment charges relating to the consolidation of our three facilities in the silicon valley into a single corporate location and costs associated with abandoned leased facilities in austin 
facilities relocation charges also include million consisting of the write down of certain operating equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the abandoned facilities 
we also incurred charges of million  through december   as a result of duplicate lease costs associated with the dual occupation of our current and abandoned facilities 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  decreased from million in to million in primarily due to the decrease in interest rates earned on cash and short term investments 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense increased from  in to million in our income tax expense in was associated with state and foreign income taxes 
our income tax expense was based on a pretax loss of million 
during the third quarter of  we changed our estimate of the annual effective tax rate as a result of revised expectations for our operating results for as a result of this change  the income tax provision recorded during the six months ended june   did not need to be changed during the six months ended december   in order to reflect the effective tax rate for the year 
accordingly  there was no provision for income taxes recorded during the six months ended december  prior to this change  excluding the effect of amortization of deferred stock based compensation  amortization of acquired intangible assets and facilities relocation charges  the effective tax rate was 
comparison of the years ended and revenues total revenues increased from million in to million in this increase reflects sales to a larger number of new customers and higher average sales price per customer 
the number of new customers increased from as of december  to over as of december  our ability to attract new customers was a result of our developing a larger and more experienced sales and marketing staff 
the increase in average sales price per customer was primarily a result of selling more user licenses in the average new order  and to a lesser extent  increased sales of optional software modules and price increases 
license 
license revenues increased from million in to million in license revenues represented and of total revenues in those periods 
this increase in license revenues reflects the same factors that caused total revenues to increase from period to period 
services 
services revenues increased from million in to million in services revenues represented and of total revenues in those periods 
the increase in services revenues reflects a million increase in professional services fees  an million increase in maintenance fees and a million increase in training fees 
the increased professional services and maintenance fees were generated by an expanded number of customers who licensed our products 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues increased from  in to million in cost of license revenues represented and of license revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in cost of license revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties paid to third party software vendors  and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in the volume of products shipped 
services 
cost of services revenues increased from million in to million in cost of services revenues represented and of services revenues  respectively 
this increase in cost of services revenues was attributable to an increase in the number of service employees and due to an increase in subcontractor expenses 
gross profit gross profit increased from million in to million in gross profit represented and of total revenues  respectively  in those periods 
this increase reflected the more rapid increase of license revenues compared to services revenues as our customer base has grown 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  representing and of total revenues in those periods  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in the number of our product development employees  increased use of sub contractors and due to higher associated wages  salaries and recruitment costs 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects a higher growth rate in total revenues compared to the growth rate in research and development expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for to million in  representing and of total revenues  respectively  in those periods 
this increase in sales and marketing expenses was caused by higher sales commissions and bonuses  increases in sales and marketing personnel costs  and increased marketing related costs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects a higher growth rate in total revenues compared to the growth rate in sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  representing and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was caused by additional staffing of these functions to support expanded operations during this same period 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects a higher growth rate in total revenues  compared to the growth rate in general and administrative expenses 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation is attributable to the following categories for the years ended december  and  respectively costs of sales  research and development  sales and marketing   general and administrative total   amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets was  in and million in in process research and development 
we recorded purchased in process research and development of approximately million and approximately  related to the acquisitions of neonyoyo and metacode  respectively  representing the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which had not yet reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date 
interest and other income  net interest income and other expense  net  increased from million for to million for  due to increased interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering in october and our follow on public offering in february provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  for state and foreign taxes in recent accounting pronouncements on september   the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting on all transactions initiated after july  and the pooling of interests method will no longer be allowed 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets that have an infinite life be recognized as assets but not be amortized 
these assets will be assessed for impairment on an annual basis 
identifiable intangible assets that have a finite life will continue to be segregated from goodwill and amortized over their useful lives 
these assets will be assessed for impairment pursuant to guidance in sfas no 
companies will be required to maintain documentation of their impairment testing activities and include significant disclosure in filings in the event of an impairment charge 
goodwill and other intangible assets arising from acquisitions completed before july  previously recognized goodwill and intangible assets will be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
beginning january  with the adoption of sfas no 
 we will cease amortizing net goodwill of million  which includes million related to assembled workforce 
as a result of this adoption  we expect amortization of acquired intangible assets to be million in and million in we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 effective july  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we will evaluate goodwill for impairment under the initial sfas no 
transitional impairment test requirements during the second quarter of and annually  thereafter 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step we will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move on step two as described below 
if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment charge is necessary 
step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting units to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess of such amount 
we expect to complete this review during the second quarter of we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon the completion of the initial review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material charge will not be recorded 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a change in accounting principle 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no

sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for impairment or disposal by sale of long lived assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued topic d income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which will require companies to report reimbursements of out of pocket expenses as revenues and the corresponding expenses incurred as costs of revenues within the income statement 
we will adopt the provisions of d during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflected net losses  increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  offset in part by an increase in accrued liabilities  deferred revenue  amortization of acquired intangibles  in process research and development expenses and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflected increasing net losses offset in part by amortization of acquired intangibles  facilities relocation charges  amortization of stock based compensation and depreciation expense 
a significant portion of our cash inflows have historically been generated by our operations 
these inflows may fluctuate significantly 
a decrease in customer demand or decrease in the acceptance of our products  would jeopardize our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations 
during and  investing activities included purchases of property and equipment  principally computer hardware and software for our growing number of employees in addition to leasehold improvements for our new facilities 
cash used to purchase property and equipment was million and million during and  respectively 
we expect that capital expenditures will increase as we grow our operations  expand our infrastructure and hire new personnel 
as of december   we had no material capital expenditure commitments 
during and  our investing activities included purchases and maturities of short term investments 
net purchases of investments were approximately million in and million in as of december   we have not invested in derivative securities 
we expect that  in the future  cash in excess of current requirements will continue to be invested in high credit quality  interest bearing securities 
during  our investing activities included a million purchase price adjustment  which primarily related to metacode technologies  inc the purchase price adjustment reflects a reduction in the valuation of cash and investments  subsequent to the acquisition date and upon completion of an audit of metacode technologies  inc during  our investing activities included the acquisitions of neonyoyo  inc  ajuba solutions  inc and metacode technologies  inc 
the net cash paid in connection with these acquisitions was million 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects the proceeds of issuance of common stock in each of these periods 
during september  the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock on the open market 
during  we repurchased  of our common shares on the open market at cost of million under this program 
we do not expect to repurchase any more shares of our common stock under this program 
at december   our sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
at december   we had million in working capital 
we have a million line of credit with washington mutual business bank  which bears interest at the wall street journal s prime rate  which was at december  and is secured by cash 
this line of credit agreement expires in may we also have a million line of credit with wells fargo bank  which is secured by cash and bears interest at our option of either a variable rate of below the bank s prime rate adjusted from time to time or a fixed rate of above the libor in effect on the first day of the term 
we had no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with all of our restrictions under the lines of credit 
this line of credit agreement expires in december we intend to maintain these lines of credit in the future 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through the following presents our future lease payments under these agreements in thousands operating year ended december  leases over five years  total payments  we have entered into various standby letter of credit agreements associated with our facilities operating lease agreements as required deposits for such facilities 
these letters of credit expire at various times through at december  we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  which are accured by substantially all of our assets 
the following presents our outstanding commitments under these agreements as each respective balance sheet date in thousands standby letters december  of credit we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents short term investment balances  cash flows from operations and funds available under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
lont term  we ma require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equit or debt financing or from other sources 
there can be assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
factors affecting future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
these risks are the ones we consider to be significant to your decision whether to invest in our common stock at this time 
we might be wrong 
there may be risks that you in particular view differently than we do  and there are other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  but that may in fact harm our business in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our operating history is limited  so it will be difficult for you to evaluate our business in making an investment decision 
we have a limited operating history and are still in the early stages of our development  which makes the evaluation of our business operations and our prospects difficult 
we shipped our first product in may since that time  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from licensing our teamsite product and related products and services 
in evaluating our common stock  you should consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  particularly those companies whose businesses depend on the internet and corporate information technology spending 
these risks and difficulties  as they apply to us in particular  include 
delay or deferral of customer orders or implementations of our products  
fluctuations in the size and timing of individual license transactions  
the mix of products and services sold  
our ability to develop and market new products and control costs  
changes in demand for our products  
concentration of our revenues in a single product or family of products and our services  
our dependence on large orders  
our ability to manage expanding operations  
our need to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  
our need to establish and maintain strategic relationships with other companies  some of which may in the future become our competitors  and 
our need to expand internationally 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to be significantly lower than expected 
based upon the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
if we do not increase our license revenues significantly  we will fail to achieve and sustain operating profitability 
we have incurred net losses from operations in each quarter since our inception through the year ended december  our net losses amounted to million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in order to expand our customer base and increase brand awareness 
to achieve and sustain operating profitability on a quarterly and annual basis  we will need to increase our revenues significantly  particularly our license revenues 
we cannot predict when we will become profitable  if at all 
furthermore  we have generally made business decisions with reference to net profit metrics excluding non cash charges  such as  acquisition and stock based compensation charges 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions  which are likely to cause us to incur certain non cash charges such as stock based compensation and intangible amortization charges  which will increase our losses 
reduced demand and increased competition may cause our services revenue to decline and our results to fluctuate unpredictably 
our services revenue represents a significant component of our total revenue and of total revenue in and we anticipate that services revenue will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the future  and the actual percentage that it represents will have an impact on our results of operations 
to a large extent  the level of services revenue depends upon our ability to license products that generate follow on services revenue  such as maintenance 
services revenue also depends on demand for professional services  which is subject to fluctuation in response to economic slowdowns 
the current economic slowdown may reduce demand for our professional services 
as systems integrators and other third parties  many of whom are our partners  become proficient in installing and servicing our products  our services revenue could decline 
whether we will be able to manage our professional services capacity successfully during the current economic slowdown is difficult to predict 
if our professional services capacity is too low we may not be able to capitalize on future increases in demand for our services  but if our capacity is too high our gross margin on services revenue will be harmed 
our operating results fluctuate widely and are difficult to predict  so we may fail to satisfy the expectations of investors or market analysts and our stock price may decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we expect them to continue to fluctuate unpredictably in the future 
however  we anticipate flat to declining revenues for the next few quarters due to the current economic slowdown 
the main factors affecting these fluctuations are 
the discretionary nature of our customer s purchases and their budget cycles  
the number of new web initiatives launched by our customers  
the size and complexity of our license transactions  
potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  
timing of new product releases  
sales force capacity and the influence of reseller partners  and 
seasonal variations in operating results 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or exceed the forecasts periodically disclosed by management or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
since large orders are increasingly important to us  our quarterly results are subject to wide fluctuation 
we derive a significant portion of our license revenues from relatively large orders 
we expect the percentage of larger orders as related to total orders to increase 
this dependence on large orders makes our net revenue and operating results more likely to vary from quarter to quarter because the loss of any particular large order is significant 
as a result  our operating results could suffer if any large orders are delayed or cancelled in any future period 
we expect that we will continue to depend upon a small number of large orders for a significant portion of our license revenues 
the recent economic slowdown has reduced our sales and will cause us to experience operating losses 
the current widespread economic slowdowns in the markets we serve have harmed our sales 
capital spending on information technology in general and capital spending on web initiatives in particular appears to have declined 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  since many of our customers are also suffering adverse effects of the general economic slowdown  we may find that collecting accounts receivable from existing or new customers will take longer than we expect or that some accounts receivable will become uncollectable 
in addition  air travel disruption and delays impair our sales efforts and our ability to deliver services to customers  which harms our revenue 
we face significant competition  which could make it difficult to acquire and retain customers and inhibit any future growth 
we expect market competition to persist and intensify 
competitive pressures may seriously harm our business and results of operations if they inhibit our future growth  or require us to hold down or reduce prices  or increase our operating costs 
our competitors include  but are not limited to 
potential customers that use in house development efforts  
developers of software that address the need for content management  such as documentum  divine  filenet  microsoft  rational  stellent and vignette 
we also face potential competition from our strategic partners  such as bea systems and ibm  or from other companies  such as oracle  that may in the future decide to compete in our market 
some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
many of these companies can also leverage extensive customer bases and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
potential competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
for example  microsoft has introduced a content management product and might choose to bundle it with other products in ways that would harm our competitive position 
barriers to entering the content management software market are relatively low 
although we believe the number of our competitors is increasing  we believe there may be consolidation in the content management software industry 
we expect that the general downturn of stock prices in the technology industries since march will result in significant acceleration of this trend  with fewer but more financially sound competitors surviving that are better able to compete with us for our current and potential customers 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic relationships  the market acceptance of our products  and our profitability  may decline 
to offer products and services to a larger customer base our direct sales force depends on strategic partnerships and marketing alliances to obtain customer leads  referrals and distribution 
for example  the majority of our revenues are associated with referrals from our strategic partners 
if we are unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or fail to enter into additional strategic relationships  our ability to increase our sales and reduce expenses will be harmed 
we would also lose anticipated customer introductions and co marketing benefits 
our success depends in part on the success of our strategic partners and their ability to market our products and services successfully 
we also rely on our strategic partnerships to aid in the development of our products 
should our strategic partners not regard us as significant for their own businesses  they could reduce their commitment to us or terminate their respective relationships with us  pursue other partnerships or relationships  or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products and services 
even if we succeed in establishing these relationships  they may not result in additional customers or revenues 
because the market for our products is new  we do not know whether existing and potential customers will purchase our products in sufficient quantity for us to achieve profitability 
the market for enterprise content management software is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
we expect that we will continue to need to educate prospective clients about the uses and benefits of our products and services 
various factors could inhibit the growth of the market and market acceptance of our products and services 
in particular  potential customers that have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business over the internet may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
we cannot be certain that the market for our products will continue to expand 
acquisitions may harm our business by being more difficult than expected to integrate  by diverting management s attention or by subjecting us to unforeseen accounting problems 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity  we might be unable to negotiate the terms of that acquisition successfully  finance it  develop the intellectual property acquired from it or integrate it into our existing business and operations 
we may also be unable to select  manage or absorb any future acquisitions successfully 
further  the negotiation of potential acquisitions  as well as the integration of an acquired business  especially if it involved our entering a new market  would divert management time and other resources and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
we may have to use a substantial portion of our available cash  including proceeds from public offerings  to consummate an acquisition 
on the other hand  if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any particular acquisition  even if successfully completed  will ultimately benefit our business 
in connection with our acquisitions  we may be required to write off software development costs or other assets  incur severance liabilities  amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets  or incur debt  any of which could harm our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the companies we acquire may not have audited financial statements  detailed financial information  or adequate internal controls 
there can be no assurance that an audit subsequent to the completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance  including with respect to revenues  expenses  contingent or other liabilities  and intellectual property 
any such write off could harm our financial results 
we may be required to write off all or a portion of the value of assets we acquired in our recent business combinations 
accounting principles require companies like us to review the value of assets from time to time to determine whether those values have been impaired 
because of the decline of our stock price in recent periods  we have begun a process of determining whether the value on our balance sheet that those acquired companies represent should be adjusted downward 
this process will include an analysis of estimated cash flows expected from future operations 
if as a result of this analysis we determine there has been an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of those assets will be written down to fair value as a charge against operating results in the period that the determination is made 
any significant impairment would harm our operating results for that period and our financial position  and could harm the price of our stock 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it particularly difficult for us to forecast revenue  requires us to incur high costs of sales  and increases the variability of our quarterly results 
the time between our initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale  which we refer to as our sales cycle  typically ranges between three and nine months  depending largely on the customer 
we believe that the recent economic slowdown has lengthened our sales cycle as customers delay decisions on implementing content management initiatives 
further  travel delays may interfere with our sales efforts and impair our revenue growth 
if we do not shorten our sales cycle  it will be difficult for us to reduce sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  as a result of our lengthy sales cycle  we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing and size of specific sales 
this makes it more difficult to predict quarterly financial performance  or to achieve it  and any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter could harm our business and cause our operating results to vary significantly 
we rely heavily on sales of one product  so if it does not continue to achieve market acceptance we will continue to experience operating losses 
since  we have generated substantially all of our revenues from licenses of  and services related to  our teamsite product 
we believe that revenues generated from teamsite will continue to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
a decline in the price of teamsite  or our inability to increase license sales of teamsite  would harm our business and operating results more seriously than it would if we had several different products and services to sell 
in addition  our future financial performance will depend upon successfully developing and selling enhanced versions of teamsite 
if we fail to deliver product enhancements or new products that customers want it will be more difficult for us to succeed 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel  which is particularly difficult for us because we compete with other technology related companies and are located in the san francisco bay area  where there is competition for personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
we compete for experienced engineering  sales and consulting personnel with technology professional services firms  software vendors  consulting and professional services companies 
it is also particularly difficult to recruit and retain personnel in the san francisco bay area  where we are located 
although we provide compensation packages that include stock options  cash incentives and other employee benefits  the volatility and current market price of our common stock may make it difficult for us to attract  assimilate and retain highly qualified employees in the future 
in addition  our customers generally purchase consulting and implementation services from us  but it is difficult and expensive to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel to perform these services  and we may from time to time have inadequate levels of staffing to perform these services 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to provide those services  or we could experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction  any of which would harm our business 
if we do not improve our operational systems on a timely basis  we will be more likely to fail in managing our growth properly 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years 
we intend to continue to expand our operational systems in the future to pursue potential market opportunities 
this expansion will place a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage our growth  we may need to implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement and improve these systems in a timely manner  our business will be seriously harmed 
difficulties in introducing new products and upgrades in a timely manner will make market acceptance of our products less likely 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and technology related enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
we expect to add new content management functionality to our product offerings by internal development  and possibly by acquisition 
content management technology is more complex than most software and new products or product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing new products could harm our business 
new products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule or may contain defects when released 
either situation could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new software products  or deliver enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
stock based compensation charges and amortization of acquired intangibles will reduce our reported net income 
in connection with our acquisitions  we allocated a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets such as goodwill  in process research and development  acquired technology  acquired workforce and covenants not to compete 
we have also recorded deferred compensation related to options assumed and shares issued to effect business combinations  as well as options granted below fair market value associated with our initial public offering in october the future amortization expense related to the acquisitions and deferred stock based compensation may be accelerated as we assess the value and useful life of the intangible assets  and accelerated expense would reduce our earnings 
in addition  our stock option repricing program requires us to record a compensation charge on a quarterly basis as a result of variable plan accounting treatment  which will lower our earnings 
this charge will be evaluated on a quarterly basis and additional charges will be recorded if the market price of our stock exceeds the price of the repriced options 
since the variable component of this charge is computed based on the current market price of our stock  such charges may vary significantly from period to period 
for example for every one dollar in value that our stock price exceeds the adjusted exercise price of these options  we will recognize an additional million in deferred stock compensation 
our products might not be compatible with all major platforms  which could limit our revenues 
our products currently operate on the microsoft windows nt  microsoft windows  linux  ibm aix  hewlett packard ux and sun solaris operating systems 
in addition  our products are required to interoperate with leading content authoring tools and web application servers 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in these applications and operating systems 
if our products were to be incompatible with a popular new operating system or business application  our business would be harmed 
in addition  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by vendors of operating systems  browsers  back office applications  and other technology related applications  could also harm our business 
we have limited experience conducting operations internationally  which may make it more difficult than we expect to continue to expand overseas and may increase the costs of doing so 
to date  we have derived most of our revenues from sales to north american customers 
our experience with international operations in many countries is limited  and there are many barriers to competing successfully in the international arena  including 
costs of customizing products for foreign countries  
difficulties developing a foreign language graphical user interface for development  
restrictions on the use of software encryption technology  
dependence on local vendors  
compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  
longer sales cycles  
revenue recognition criteria  
foreign exchange fluctuations  
import and export restrictions and tariffs  and 
negotiating and executing sales in a foreign language 
as a result of these competitive barriers  we cannot assure you that we will be able to market  sell and deliver our products and services in international markets 
we might not be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  a loss of which could harm our business 
we depend upon our proprietary technology  and rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect it 
we currently do not have any issued united states or foreign patents  but we have applied for several us and foreign patents 
it is possible that patents will not be issued from our currently pending patent applications or any future patent application we may file 
we have also restricted customer access to our source code and required all employees to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as the laws of the united states  and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international presence 
in addition  third parties may claim that our products infringe theirs 
our failure to deliver defect free software could result in losses and harmful publicity 
our software products are complex and have in the past and may in the future contain defects or failures that may be detected at any point in the product s life 
we have discovered software defects in the past in some of our products after their release 
although past defects have not had a material effect on our results of operations  in the future we may experience delays or lost revenue caused by new defects 
despite our testing  defects and errors may still be found in new or existing products  and may result in delayed or lost revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve acceptance  reduced customer satisfaction  diversion of development resources and damage to our reputation 
as has occurred in the past  new releases of products or product enhancements may require us to provide additional services under our maintenance contracts to ensure proper installation and implementation 
moreover  third parties may develop and spread computer viruses that may damage the functionality of our software products 
any damage to or interruption in the performance of our software could also harm our business 
defects in our products may result in customer claims against us that could cause unanticipated losses 
because customers rely on our products for business critical processes  defects or errors in our products or services might result in tort or warranty claims 
it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions in our contracts will not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
we have not experienced any product liability claims like this to date  but we could in the future 
further  although we maintain errors and omissions insurance  this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover us 
a successful product liability claim could harm our business 
even defending a product liability suit  regardless of its merits  could harm our business because it entails substantial expense and diverts the time and attention of key management personnel 
we have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts  which might tend to suppress our stock price 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control include 
we are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock  which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares  or to implement a stockholders rights plan  and thwart a takeover attempt  
we provide for the election of only one third of our directors at each annual meeting of stockholders  which slows turnover on the board of directors  
we limit who may call special meetings of stockholders  
we prohibit stockholder action by written consent  so all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and 
we require advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
the location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes and power outages 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
additionally  california has experienced power outages in the recent past 
a significant disaster  such as an earthquake or a prolonged power outage  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition by disrupting our employees productivity or damaging our facilities 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency may harm our business 
we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes 
historically  these risks were minimal for us  but as our international revenue and operations have grown and continue to grow  the adverse currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures have related to operating expenses and sales in australia  asia and europe that were not us dollar denominated 
the increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european union could affect our foreign exchange exposure 
defense of class action lawsuits could be costly 
we have been notified of the commencement of a purported class action litigation alleging violations of federal securities laws by us 
while we believe the litigation is without merit  our defense of this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of december   all securities held in our portfolio mature within one year or less from the date of purchase 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  fair value cash equivalents and short term investments   average interest rates the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  fair value cash equivalents and short term investments   average interest rates we did not hold derivative financial instruments as of december   and have never held such instruments in the past 
in addition  we had no outstanding debt as of december  as of december   we had unrealized gains of  associated with these investments 
assuming an average investment balance of million  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in a  increase decrease in annual interest income 
foreign currency risk currently the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  as a result we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we do expect to effect some transactions in foreign currencies in  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date 
commodity price risk we did not hold commodity instruments as of december   and have never had such instruments in the past
