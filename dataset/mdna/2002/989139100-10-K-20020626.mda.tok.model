the company s pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense and there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in adapting its products or business to alternate technologies 
failure of the company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new or enhanced products that are compatible with industry standards and that satisfy customer price and performance requirements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s competitors may offer enhancements to existing products or offer new products based upon new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements  that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to the company s products  which could render the company s existing and future products obsolete  unmarketable or inoperable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop new products to compete with new technologies on a timely basis or in a cost effective manner 
see business research and development 
competition the markets for the company s products are also characterized by intense competition 
competition could further increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or upgrade existing products to accommodate new technologies and features 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have a longer operating history and greater technical  manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than the company and  as a result  may be able to adapt more quickly or devote greater resources to changing technological requirements  customer demands and market trends 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends upon elements both within and outside its control  including successful and timely development of new products and manufacturing processes  product performance and quality  manufacturing yields and product availability  customer services  pricing  industry trends and general economic trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully as to these factors 
see business competition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its key technical and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the development of mixed signal products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
the loss of the services of the company s employees or the company s failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not have any employment agreements with its employees  other than patrick j 
brockett  its president and chief executive officer 
intellectual property protection the company s success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary technologies and processes 
there can be no assurance that such measures will provide meaningful protection for the company s proprietary technologies and processes 
the company has been issued many patents  principally in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  and has filed numerous patent applications in such jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that any patent will issue from these applications or future applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that any right granted thereunder would provide meaningful protection or a competitive advantage to the company 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to the company s technology would make it easier for the company s competitors to offer similar products 
the company also generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and strategic partners and generally controls access to and distribution of its product documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products  services or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around the company s patents 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
certain of the company s customers have entered into agreements with the company pursuant to which such customers have the right to use the company s proprietary technology in the event the company defaults in its contractual obligations  including product supply obligations  and fails to cure the default within a specified period of time 
moreover  the company often incorporates the intellectual property of its strategic customers into its design and the company has certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to prevent misappropriation or infringement of the intellectual property of the company or its customers will be successful 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including its customers 
such litigation could result in substantial costs to the company and diversion of the company s resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property claims the segment of the semiconductor market that includes the company s products has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company has been in the past and may in the future be notified of claims that its products or services are subject to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties 
although the company attempts to ensure that its products and processes do not infringe such third party patents or proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against the company 
periodically  the company negotiates with third parties to establish patent license or cross license agreements 
there can be no assurance that current or future negotiations will result in the company obtaining a license on satisfactory terms or at all 
moreover  license agreements with third parties may not include all intellectual property rights that may be issued to or owned by the licensors and thus future disputes with these companies are possible 
in the event an intellectual property dispute is not settled through a license  litigation could result 
any litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of effort by the company s technical and managerial personnel 
an adverse determination in such litigation or proceeding could prevent the company from making  using or selling certain of its products and subject the company to damage assessments  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions the company may make strategic acquisitions and investments or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances with other companies 
such transactions entail many risks  including the following inability to integrate successfully such companies personnel and businesses  inability to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value associated with such transactions  diversion of management s attention and disruption of the company s ongoing business  inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  inability to establish and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of new personnel 
in addition  future acquisitions or investments by the company may result in the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  significant borrowings  significant one time write offs and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets 
failure to avoid these or other risks associated with such business combinations  investments  joint ventures or strategic alliances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
significant international operations approximately of the company s sales from continuing operations in fiscal were derived from sales in markets outside the united states and outside north america 
the company expects sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
the company operates three manufacturing facilities as well as sales and technical support service centers in europe and asia 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  political and economic conditions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  future import and export restrictions  difficulties in staffing and managing operations  difficulties in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that the above factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
foreign exchange and interest rate exposure and concentration of credit risk because substantial portions of the company s costs of sales and other expenses are denominated in us dollars  us pounds sterling  and several other currencies  the company s results of operations are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations of those currencies relative to the canadian dollar  the parent company s functional currency 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which the company and its competitors sell their products in the same markets 
the company uses financial instruments  principally forward exchange contracts  in its management of foreign currency exposures on estimated net foreign currency cash requirements and on certain significant transactions  over the ensuing months 
all foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and  to the extent these contracts qualify as effective hedges  the resulting unrealized gains and losses are deferred and included in the measurement of the related transactions when they occur 
these contracts primarily require the company to purchase and sell certain foreign currencies with or for canadian dollars at contractual rates 
several major financial institutions are counterparties to the company s financial instruments 
it is the company s practice to monitor the financial standing of the counterparties and limit the amount of exposure to any one institution 
the company may be exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties of these contracts 
with respect to accounts receivable  concentration of credit risk is limited due to the diverse areas covered by the company s operations 
the company has credit evaluation  approval and monitoring processes intended to mitigate potential credit risks 
anticipated bad debt loss has been provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s operations could be adversely affected if it is unable to guard against currency  interest and credit risks in the future 
there can be no assurance that foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations or credit risk will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
although the company believes that it has complied with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects and to date has not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
such regulations could require the company to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal or storage of or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject the company to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

revenue in fiscal  however  increased by  or  from revenue in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was principally due to higher demand by telecom and data networking manufacturers for the company s network access products in the early part of fiscal and before the industry went into decline 
in fiscal  the company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share 
the net loss included a special inventory write down of  special charges of related to restructuring and asset impairments  stock compensation expense of  a loss on the sale of the bromont foundry  amortization of acquired intangibles of  and a write off of related to the company s investment in optenia  inc which went into receivership

network access and user access products represent the two major growth categories in this business segment 
network access products include products that provide connectivity to a network s core backbone such as feeder  aggregation and transmission applications and products that address the multi protocol physical and network layers 
in simple terms  network access semiconductor products connect network equipment together 
user access products allow users to connect to the network 
these products include wireless for example  cellular chipsets and infotainment applications for example  set top boxes and digital tv 
revenue for fiscal totaled  down from in fiscal and down from in fiscal revenue was adversely affected by customer and channel inventory adjustments in the company s network access and user access business  a trend that began during the second half of fiscal and continued through fiscal reflecting the semiconductor communications industry in general  the company has experienced order push outs and cancellations  both resulting from market uncertainties 
however  since the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has experienced a significant decrease in order push outs and cancellations  with customers typically placing orders to meet their short term needs 
as a result  the turns business customers placing orders for shipment in the same fiscal quarter has been steadily increasing since the second quarter of fiscal to represent approximately of the orders shipped in a quarter 
management believes that this industry trend may continue through calendar the results in the communications segment were also adversely affected by an excess inventory charge to cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal amounting to for inventories estimated to be beyond its needs for the following months 
this write down was necessary in light of the downturn in the communications semiconductor industry 
in addition to the above market conditions  the communications group s results were reduced by the company s continuing significant investment in research and development to develop and launch new products supporting broadband communications 
during fiscal  the company continued to secure design wins and introduced new products to the market  up from nine new products introduced in fiscal medical millions of us dollars of total of total of total revenue medical as a of total revenue medical operating income zarlink s medical business provides asic solutions for applications such as pacemakers  hearing aids and portable instruments 
medical sales increased in fiscal over fiscal due to growing markets and new product introductions 
medical s operating results improved over last year due to improved manufacturing yields 
during fiscal  the medical group introduced eight new products in addition to the seven new products introduced in fiscal compared to fiscal  fiscal medical sales increased due to new product introductions and to favorable conditions in the industry 
the operating results  however  were adversely affected by unfavorable manufacturing yields and higher research and development expenses 
geographic revenue revenue from continuing operations  based on the geographic location of customers  was distributed as follows millions of us dollars of total of total of total united states europe asia pacific canada other regions total for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal favorably impacted total revenue from continuing operations by 
for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal negatively impacted total revenue from continuing operations by 
the negative foreign exchange impact in fiscal was primarily a result of changes in the uk pound sterling exchange rate  partially offset by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
united states sales from continuing operations into the united states decreased by in fiscal over fiscal the decrease was due to lower communication product sales in both network access and user access 
sales from continuing operations increased by in the united states in fiscal over fiscal  principally due to higher sales of network access products 
europe european sales decreased by in fiscal over fiscal due to lower network access and user access product sales 
fiscal sales into europe increased by over fiscal due to higher sales of medical products and an increase in foundry services provided to outside parties 
asia pacific asia pacific sales decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower network access and user access product sales 
fiscal sales in the asia pacific region increased by over fiscal  principally due to higher demand for switching and framing products and to higher sales of ip switching products resulting from the acquisition of vertex networks  incorporated vertex in july canada canadian sales increased by in fiscal over fiscal mostly due to the inclusion of sales to mitel networks corporation  successor to the systems business that was sold on february   which during fiscal was no longer affiliated with zarlink 
sales from continuing operations decreased in canada from fiscal to fiscal by as a result of lower sales to data networking customers combined with the sector s slow down

as a result of this review  the company recorded an excess inventory charge to cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal amounting to for inventories estimated to be beyond its needs for the following months 
excluding the effect of the excess inventory charge of  the company s gross margin as a percent of revenue was for the year ended march  the lower gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally attributable to lower sales volumes of network access and user access products and the associated negative manufacturing variances resulting from lower plant utilization 
gross margin in fiscal improved relative to fiscal by percentage points 
the improvement was due to a favorable sales mix as a result of higher sales volumes of network access products and to positive manufacturing variances resulting from improved manufacturing plant utilization 
operating expenses research and development r d millions of us r d expenses as a percent of revenue r d expenses decreased by  or  in fiscal from fiscal due to restructuring and the consolidation of r d activities in the year just completed 
management expects that r d spending will increase slightly in fiscal while investments continue to be made in expected high growth and high return product offerings  such as broadband transmission and digital tv 
fiscal r d increased relative to fiscal r d due to incremental r d resulting from the acquisition of vertex  coupled with the increased r d activity in the network access and user access product lines 
investments are being made in high growth areas such as network access and user access and in medical devices 
in the network access product line  the focus was in the following areas o building network timing and synchronization products for high speed applications  o delivering multi channel carrier class convergence solutions  including time division multiplex tdm switching  asynchronous transfer mode atm convergence  or internet protocol ip switching  o supporting high speed access using digital subscriber line dsl solutions  o providing high quality voice in packet switching applications to metro and enterprise markets  and o very short reach vsr parallel optical solutions targeted at terabit speeds and higher 
in the user access product line  the focus was in the following areas o providing a single chip solution incorporating multiple tuners up to three tuners on a chip for terrestrial  satellite and cable digital tuning  and o delivering chip based solutions to integrate set top box features for integrated digital tv idtv 
in medical  the focus was on semiconductor solutions and technologies for a variety of in vivo and audiological applications  including o implantable pacemakers and defibrillators for cardiac rhythm control  hearing aids  cochlear implants auditory nerve stimulators for restoring hearing in the profoundly deaf  and medical instruments for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications  o ultra low power radio frequency rf to support high bandwidth communication with medical devices that have more and more diagnostic capability  o ultra low power audio processing and dsp to support digital hearing aids providing improved sound quality that can be better matched to the patient s hearing loss  and o application specific standard products assps as opposed to asics 
selling and administrative s a millions of us s a expenses as a percent of revenue s a expenses decreased in fiscal by  or from fiscal as a result of cost reductions implemented during the year in response to the industry downturn 
in fiscal  s a expenses increased by  or  from fiscal as a result of higher depreciation related to the newly implemented enterprise resource planning system  increased marketing spending  and certain expenses incurred while the company transitioned to a focused semiconductor company 
management expects that s a expenses will remain flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal stock compensation expense the company s stock compensation expense arises from retention conditions associated with the stock awarded to certain employees of vertex which was acquired in july  from certain stock options subjected to an exchange program  and from certain stock options awarded to former employees 
special charge special charge recorded in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded a special charge of related to restructuring and certain asset impairments 
in response to the industry downturn  the company announced on may  that it had implemented a cost containment plan in order to preserve cash resources 
the cost containment plan included a workforce reduction of approximately of the company s total employee base or employees globally 
the workforce resizing was in addition to a workforce reduction that was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax special charge of related to that program in the quarter ended june  the special charge was comprised of a workforce reduction charge of approximately primarily relating to the cost of severance and benefits for the termination of employees throughout the world in fiscal  and a charge of approximately relating to the cost of lease and contract settlements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took additional measures to reduce its operating costs by increasing its workforce reduction program and providing for excess office space 
prior to march   the company incurred additional severance and benefit costs of related to the termination of employees throughout the world 
in addition  the special charge in the fourth quarter included the cost of excess space in ottawa  canada of approximately the company also reviewed the carrying value for certain manufacturing assets in the year ended march  based on an analysis of estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from changes in the expected use of these fixed assets  the company determined that the carrying value of these fixed assets was impaired and recorded a write down of the company also recorded a write down of in the year ended march  related to the economic uncertainty of certain long term investments held at cost 
the fourth quarter special charge was net of a reversal amounting to from the first quarter restructuring provision that was no longer required 
the reversal was due to savings on the workforce reduction program and to the subsequent sub letting of vacant space in irvine  california just after the close of fiscal special charge recorded in fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge  before taxes  of in the fourth quarter of fiscal in respect of certain capital assets 
the basis for the impairment charge is described below 
the recent industry slowdown was one of the key factors that led to a review of the company s carrying value of acquired intangible assets related to vertex 
management believed the unfavorable market conditions would continue for the foreseeable future to negatively affect the timing of expected future cash flows resulting from the acquired technology 
management believes the technology itself is sound and is a critical element in the company s focus on ip based products 
accordingly  the company reviewed the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with vertex in the fourth quarter ended march  based on an analysis of undiscounted estimated future cash flows and current and expected adverse market conditions  the company determined that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets was impaired 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write down the carrying value of the goodwill relating to vertex 
as at march   the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets related to vertex amounted to the balance was expensed in fiscal the company also reviewed the carrying value of its fabrication facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal factors leading to the review for impairment included management s expectation that fab utilization would fall to less than and hence lower cash flows to recover the investment in the fabs 
the lowered expectation resulted from recent partnerships that were developed with outside fabs for new zarlink designs based on future technologies that are beyond existing capabilities at the company s fabs 
this review also considered the adverse market conditions  which resulted in a low operating rate for these facilities as well as the company s manufacturing strategy  described above  that is expected to incorporate higher degrees of outsourcing 
based on an analysis of undiscounted expected future cash flows reflecting these conditions  the company determined that the fabrication buildings and equipment were impaired and recorded a charge of  before income tax recoveries of  to write down these carrying values 
the tax recovery was separately included in the company s total income tax expense 
loss on sale of business the company recorded a loss on sale of the bromont foundry business of  before income tax recoveries of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal on february   zarlink sold its foundry facility in bromont  quebec  and related business to dalsa semiconductor inc dalsa for under the agreement  zarlink received from dalsa in cash and retained a investment in the bromont foundry 
the bromont facility is an operation featuring complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos process technology for digital and mixed signal analog digital communications products 
the plant also has other processes supporting industrial  scientific and space applications  particularly high end imaging applications 
the two companies also signed a three year agreement to ensure continuity of supply for zarlink products manufactured at bromont 
there is no minimum unit volume purchase requirement under the agreement 
approximately zarlink employees affiliated with the bromont operation were transferred to dalsa as part of the agreement 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles decreased in fiscal to from in fiscal the remaining acquired intangibles  including goodwill  resulting from the acquisition of vertex on july  were expensed in fiscal the expense of was comprised of regular amortization of and an accelerated write down of associated with the impairment of other acquired intangibles to reduce the carrying value to nil as at march  the fiscal amount of related to a previous acquisition that was fully written off by the end of the prior year 
other income expense other income expense was comprised of interest income  foreign exchange gains  and equity losses from the investment in optenia 
interest income was for the year ended march  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease from fiscal was due to lower average cash balances on hand and to low interest rates 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to higher average cash balances on hand 
foreign exchange gains in fiscal amounted to loss of  gain of 
during fiscal  the company recorded a net increase in earnings  representing a gain on hedge ineffectiveness 
also impacting other income was a net increase in earnings due to the marking to market of certain forward contracts prior to their designation as cash flow hedges in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded an equity loss from its investment in optenia amounting to the equity loss in fiscal was  representing only one quarter of activity since the original investment in january in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the investment in optenia was written off after it went into bankruptcy 
interest expense interest expense was for fiscal  compared with and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest expense decreased due to the repayment of long term debt 
income taxes income tax recovery from continuing operations for fiscal was  compared with an expense of for fiscal and for fiscal the recovery in fiscal was principally due to the loss on sale of the cmos foundry in bromont  canada 
the tax expense in fiscal and fiscal was mostly attributable to taxable income in canada 
the company s effective tax rate was a recovery of for fiscal this tax rate is lower than the domestic tax rate primarily due to unrecorded temporary differences and losses incurred during the year 
in fiscal  zarlink s effective tax rate from continuing operations was an expense of 
this tax rate is lower than the domestic tax rate primarily due to the write down of non deductible goodwill and purchased in process research and development  and unrecorded losses and temporary differences in the company s foreign operations 
in fiscal  zarlink s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 
this tax rate is lower than the domestic tax rate primarily due to the utilization of investment tax credits in the company s domestic operations and the realization of previously unrecorded loss carryforwards in the company s foreign operations 
the company has a valuation allowance at the end of fiscal of fiscal 
the increase relates mainly to losses incurred in the company s foreign jurisdictions and temporary differences in the company s domestic operations 
management has determined that sufficient uncertainties exist regarding the realization of certain of its deferred tax assets 
backlog millions of us day backlog generally  manufacturing lead times for semiconductor products are longer because of the nature of the production process 
however  as orders are sometimes booked and shipped within the same fiscal quarter often referred to as turns  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of a sales outlook for the quarter or year 
the backlog decrease from last year was attributable to the recent downturn in the communications semiconductor industry  described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis  which caused cancellations and re scheduling of orders  principally in the areas of broadband networking 
discontinued operations communications systems business there were no discontinued operations included in the results of operations in the year ended march  on february   the company concluded the sale of the systems business to dr 
terence h 
matthews for net proceeds of  after adjustments 
as a result of this sale  the company recorded a net gain of  after transaction costs and income taxes in the year ended march  systems recorded revenue of during the period from april  to february   down from for the full year in fiscal the revenue decrease from the prior year was principally due to industry wide market softness while end customers delayed capital spending on systems and applications 
management believes industry announcements regarding new voice communications systems moving to an ip platform resulted in certain customers deferring capital spending in order to acquire the advanced functionality afforded by the new ip platforms in the future 
during the period up to the measurement date of november  the date the company adopted formal plans to pursue divestiture opportunities related to the systems business  the systems business had an operating loss  net of tax recoveries of  of  net of taxes of 
net income loss the company recorded a net loss of  or per share in fiscal this compares to a net loss of  or per share  in fiscal in fiscal  net income was  or per share 
the net loss in fiscal resulted primarily from lower revenue due to the communications industry downturn which in turn led to a charge for excess inventory of and special charges of the loss also included the loss on sale of the bromont foundry business  stock compensation expense of  and the impairment of the company s equity investment in optenia amounting to the net loss in fiscal resulted primarily from the charge for impairment of capital assets of  the amortization of acquired intangibles of and the expense of associated with early repayment of long term debt  partially offset by income  net of taxes  from discontinued operations amounting to in fiscal  net income was impacted by the amortization of acquired intangibles of but offset by income  net of taxes  from discontinued operations of liquidity and capital resources at march   cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances totaled  down from at march  cash and cash equivalents at march   included in the amount above  amounted to cash flow used in operations before working capital changes amounted to during fiscal compared to cash flow from operations of in fiscal as a result of the lower operating earnings 
since march   the company s working capital  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  decreased by mostly due to reductions in inventories and improved cash collections against trade receivables 
management expects to further draw down inventory levels in fiscal by reducing cycle times and managing inventories on a build to order basis

other critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect zarlink s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
the company s semiconductor products are primarily non commodity  specialized products that are proprietary in design and used by multiple customers 
customer acceptance provisions for performance requirements are generally based on seller specified criteria  which we demonstrate prior to shipment 
should management determine that these customer acceptance provisions are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be affected 
inventory the company periodically compares its inventory levels to revenue forecasts for the future twelve months on a part by part basis and records a charge for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated twelve month demand 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company s inventory of network access and user access products exceeded the estimated month demand by as a result of the industry downturn to result in a charge of the same amount 
if future demand for the company s products continues to decline  an additional write down of inventory may be necessary 
restructuring during fiscal  the company recorded significant reserves in connection with the restructuring program 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although management does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
income taxes zarlink has incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce the tax liability on those earnings 
as management is uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  the company has taken a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and recorded only deferred tax assets that can be applied against income in currently taxable jurisdictions or applied against deferred tax liabilities which will reverse in the future 
in establishing the appropriate valuation allowance for tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences  it is necessary to consider all available evidence  both positive and negative 
historical information of profitability is supplemented by current information which is available about future years 
based on the current environment and current information  there is a greater degree of uncertainty that the level of future profitability used to determine the appropriate valuation allowance in the past will be achieved 
as a result  the company has adjusted the valuation allowance to account for these uncertainties 
investment in private companies the company has investments in private companies  which management reviews periodically to determine if there has been other than a temporary decline in the market value of those investments below the carrying value 
management s assessment of impairment in carrying value is based on the market value trends of similar public companies and the current business performance of those investments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment of its investment in one private company amounting to when management performs future assessments of these investments  a further decline in the value of these companies may require the company to recognize additional impairment on the remaining related to these investments 
foreign currency translation management periodically evaluates the financial and operational independence of its foreign operations 
should a foreign subsidiary s local currency cease to be its functional currency  then translation gains or losses on consolidating the foreign subsidiary s financial statements subsequent to the change in functional currency would be charged to operating income instead of a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  business combinations and statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of assets acquired  including goodwill and intangibles  and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
sfas requires goodwill to be allocated to  and assessed as part of  a reporting unit 
further  sfas specifies that goodwill will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
the impairment test is a two step process 
first  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to identify possible impairment and then  if necessary  the impairment is measured through a deemed purchase price allocation 
under this standard  the company will also be required to review the useful lives of acquired goodwill and intangible assets at least annually 
the company is required to adopt sfas and on a prospective basis as of march  the adoption of sfas and is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows unless the company acquires significant additional companies

european union and the euro on january   of member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
the conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
the company s operating subsidiaries that were affected by the euro conversion established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues included the need to adapt computer and financial systems  competitive impacts of cross border price transparency  and recalculating currency risk 
the required system conversion costs were not material due to zarlink s existing ability to transact in multiple currencies 
due to significant uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the effects one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
forward looking statements certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of zarlink  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include the following general economic and business conditions  demographic changes  import protection and regulation  rapid technology development and changes  timing of product introductions  the mix of products services  industry competition  industry capacity and other industry trends  and the ability of zarlink to attract and retain key employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial statements of the company due to adverse changes in financial markets 
zarlink is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage these risks  the company uses certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative instruments from time to time  that have been authorized pursuant to board approved policies and procedures 
zarlink does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company currently uses forward contracts  and to a lesser extent foreign currency options  to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the most significant foreign exchange exposures for the company relate to the canadian dollar and the uk pound sterling 
at march   there were unrealized losses of on the forward contracts relating to fiscal the unrealized loss is calculated as the difference between the actual contract rates and the applicable current market rates that would be used to terminate the forward contracts on march   if it became necessary to unwind these contracts 
additional potential losses in the net fair value of these contracts  assuming a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies  at march   would have been approximately conversely  a depreciation in the us dollar against all currencies would have produced a gain of us management believes that the established hedges are effective against its known and anticipated cash flows  and that potential future losses from these hedges being marked to market would be largely offset by gains on the underlying hedged transactions 
for fiscal  the company s primary exposure to interest rates is expected to be in the rollover of its short term investment portfolio 
in accordance with company policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than one year 
the company does not hedge the re investment risk on its short term investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at march  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the impact to the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio by an immediate hypothetical parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points would result in a decline or increase in portfolio value of approximately  and respectively 
the estimated potential losses discussed previously assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
they do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and do not represent projected losses in fair value that the company expects to incur 
any future financial impact would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest and foreign exchange rate risks in the near future
