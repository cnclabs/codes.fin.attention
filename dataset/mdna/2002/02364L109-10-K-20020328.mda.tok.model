item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue and cost recognition  loss contracts  professional and general liability insurance  legal contingencies  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue and cost recognition the company s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts adjusted for census fluctuations 
revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered 
cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed 
healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians  nurses and other healthcare professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing the managed care 
the cost of healthcare services provided or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in part on estimates  including an accrual for unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet dates 
the company estimates this medical claims reserve using an actuarial analysis prepared by an independent actuary taking into account historical claims experience including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services and other actuarial data 
while management believes that its estimation methodology effectively captures trends in medical claims costs  actual payments and future reserve requirements could differ significantly from the company s current estimates if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the company s future claims experience 
changes in estimates of claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded changes in accounting estimate charges of approximately million to strengthen medical claims reserves due to adverse development of prior years medical claims primarily as a result of updated information that indicated actual utilization and cost data for inpatient and outpatient services were higher than the historical levels previously used to estimate the reserve 
loss contracts the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future contractual revenue  projected future healthcare and maintenance costs  projected future stop loss insurance recoveries and each contract s specific terms related to future revenue increases as compared to increased healthcare costs 
the projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management s estimate of future cost increases 
these estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously noted 
as discussed above  some of the company s contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed base fee upon changes in the regional medical care component of the consumer price index  while others do not contain such provisions 
the company performs an annual comprehensive review of its portfolio of contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a contract loss reserve for succeeding years 
as a result of the review  the company identified five non cancelable contracts with combined annual revenues of million and negative gross margin of million 
based upon management s projections  these contracts are expected to continue to incur negative gross margin over their remaining terms 
in december  the company recorded a charge of million to establish a reserve for future losses under these non cancelable contracts 
the five contracts covered by the charge have expiration dates ranging from june  through june  ninety percent of the charge relates to the state of kansas contract  which expires june   and the city of philadelphia contract  which expires june  the remaining liability covers the state of maine contract  which expires june   and two county contracts  which expire august  and june  professional and general liability insurance as a healthcare provider  the company may become subject to medical malpractice claims or lawsuits 
the most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging lack of timely or adequate healthcare services 
the company may also be liable  as employer  for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or the healthcare professionals it engages as independent contractors 
the company s contracts generally require it to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the company or its agents 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  in  the company maintained third party commercial insurance on a claims made basis with primary limits of million each occurrence and million in the aggregate 
in addition  during  the company maintained excess liability insurance of million for each claim and million annual aggregate 
the company also requires the healthcare professionals it employs and its independent contractors to maintain professional liability insurance 
the company assumes liabilities in excess of these third party insurance limits 
the company records a liability for its estimated uninsured exposure to reported and unreported professional liability claims based upon an independent actuarial estimate of the cost of settling losses and projected loss adjustment expenses using historical claims data  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
reserves for medical malpractice exposures are subject to fluctuations in frequency and severity of claims experience 
the reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third party insurance carriers used by the company 
changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
as discussed in note  during  the company increased its legal reserves for professional and general liability claims by million primarily as a result of liquidation by certain insurance carriers who provided coverage to the company from legal contingencies in addition to professional and general liability claims  the company is also subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
such proceedings generally relate to labor  employment or contract matters 
the company accrues an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon an estimated range of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions  new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer contracts acquired in acquisitions and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company assesses the impairment of its identifiable intangibles and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review include the following significant underperformance or loss of key contracts acquired in an acquisition relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the company s acquired assets or in the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with its acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
during  the company was notified that another vendor had been selected to negotiate a contract to provide healthcare services for the eastern region of the pennsylvania department of corrections upon the expiration of the company s contract on december  the company also anticipates that it will cease operations under the contract with the yonkers region of the new york department of correctional services upon the expiration of the company s contract on may  as the healthcare services are to be assumed by the client 
these contracts represent substantially all of the operations acquired in the acquisition of certain assets of cps 
given these factors  in accordance with fas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million representing the excess net goodwill recorded in connection with the aforementioned acquisition of certain assets of cps over the fair value of the two contracts 
the company estimated the fair value of the contracts by calculating the net present value of estimated cash flows during the remaining term of the contracts adjusted for certain other factors 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  the company will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  the company will be required to perform impairment reviews of goodwill on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators  such as those discussed above  arise 
amortization expense related to goodwill in was  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas requires the company to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it further states forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
at december   a valuation allowance has been recorded equal to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences 
assuming the company achieves sufficient profitability in future years to realize the deferred income tax assets  the valuation allowance will be reduced in future years through a credit to income tax expense increasing shareholders equity
