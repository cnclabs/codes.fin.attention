this includes improving our operating return on sales  gross profit margins and shareholder return  maintaining a strong balance sheet  and reducing research and development  sales and general administration expenses as a percent of total sales 
acquisition of yieldup international corporation on october   we completed the acquisition of yieldup international corporation  a publicly held company that designed  developed  manufactured and marketed immersion cleaning  rinsing and drying equipment used in the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices 
under the terms of the acquisition  yieldup shareholders received and of a share of our common stock for each share of yieldup stock 
yieldup option holders received substitute options entitling them to purchase fsi common stock 
the acquisition of immersion technology provided us with additional process solutions for the critical cleaning market  the largest market segment in semiconductor cleaning 
yieldup s operations have been consolidated into the operations of the surface conditioning division 
yieldup international corporation is now known as scd mountain view  inc industry background the complex process of fabricating semiconductor devices involves several distinct phases that are repeated numerous times 
because each production phase typically requires different processing technologies and equipment  no one semiconductor equipment supplier currently produces all of the types of tools needed to equip an entire state of the art fabrication facility 
instead  semiconductor device manufacturers typically equip their facilities by combining manufacturing equipment produced by a number of suppliers 
each set of equipment performs specific functions in the manufacturing process 
generally  the need for new processes  larger substrates  and systems capable of manufacturing increasingly complex devices drives demand for new microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes 
industries that use microelectronics increasingly demand higher performance devices from manufacturers 
over the last decade  device manufacturers have reduced the size and substantially increased the functionality of individual devices through a number of technological advances 

table of contents our business depends upon the microelectronics manufacturers capital equipment expenditures 
manufacturers expenditures in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for products that use microelectronic devices 
the microelectronics industry has been cyclical in nature and has experienced periodic downturns 
we continue to believe that microelectronics manufacturers are asking equipment suppliers to take an increasingly active role in meeting the manufacturers technology capital productivity requirements 
equipment suppliers do this by developing and supporting products and processes required to address the new trends in microelectronics manufacturing 
these trends include development of smaller geometries  transition to new materials  migration to mm wafers  and wafer level packaging 
products we changed our revenue recognition policy effective august   based upon guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
as a result  all revenues reported for fiscal and are sab based  whereby we generally recognize system sales once the system s predetermined specifications or acceptance criteria are met 
all prior years revenues were recognized upon shipment 
the mix of products we sell may vary significantly from year to year 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the amount of revenues and approximate percentages of our total revenues by our principal product lines fiscal year ended august  august  august  dollars in thousands microlithography products surface conditioning products spare parts and service microlithography products our microlithography products are used to deposit photosensitive or insulating films onto the surface of a wafer and develop the photosensitive films 
polaris microlithography clusters 
these systems perform all photolithography processing steps except exposure 
in the cluster  various process modules surround multiple cleanroom qualified robots in a self contained process environment 
the cluster is configured to meet or exceed the throughput capabilities of the integrated exposure tool stepper 
to operate  the robots transport wafers loaded into the cluster s input output module through the various process modules in a sequence programmed by the operator 
the polaris cluster offers an alternative to photoresist track or other cluster type systems that process wafers according to a pre established arrangement of the equipment 
the polaris cluster provides system flexibility that ensures consistent process performance throughout all available process paths and results in superior critical dimension control over competing systems 
the system s unique central robot architecture minimizes the need for additional transport mechanisms that can adversely impact system reliability 
polaris cluster system process modules can be serviced from outside the tool without disrupting other cluster process operations 
when technological advances make it necessary to replace equipment  individual modules can be replaced or modified with an upgraded module without rendering the entire system obsolete 
the polaris microlithography cluster extends the productivity benefits of the polaris cluster platform to mm wafer processing 
the tool is targeted at mm and smaller design applications 
each model uses the same kind of wafer handling system  environmental control system and 
table of contents software 
several process modules were designed to accommodate both mm and mm wafers in a common module  which allows customers to process both wafer sizes with minimum changeover time between lots 
the price of our polaris clusters range from approximately  to  depending on wafer size  number of modules and number of robots required 
originally  the polaris cluster technology was licensed from texas instruments in many improvements have been incorporated into the product 
see patents  trademarks and intellectual property below for additional information regarding the polaris cluster license 
calypso tm low k system with instacure tm module 
based on our polaris cluster platform  the calypso system deposits organic and inorganic low k dielectric films on semiconductor substrates 
because of its modular architecture  users can extend or adapt to ultra low k nonporous films for future technology nodes 
at the heart of the calypso system is the instacure module  a proprietary high temperature anaerobic bake module that optimizes wafer temperature and oxygen content within the chamber throughout the in line single wafer curing process 
because the instacure process eliminates the need for a traditional curing furnace  it reduces cleanroom space requirements  capital and operating costs  power consumption and the risk of damage to wafers 
the calypso system can be modified to accommodate both mm and mm wafer processing 
the spin on dielectric equipment market is still in its infancy stage 
sales of calypso systems depend on the successful adoption of spin on dielectric materials over more common chemical vapor deposition low k materials 
to date  there have been no sales of the calypso system and we have not placed significant marketing efforts towards this product 
the price of the calypso system ranges from approximately  to  depending on the configuration 
surface conditioning products our surface conditioning products perform cleaning  etching and stripping functions necessary to fabricate microelectronic devices 
spray processing systems 
our spray processing systems  which include the mercury and zeta surface conditioning systems  are sophisticated spray chemistry systems that clean  etch and strip wafers at various stages in the device fabrication process 
in these systems  centrifugal spray technology exposes wafers to a programmed  sequenced spray of fresh chemicals inside a closed  nitrogen filled chamber 
cassettes filled with wafers are loaded into a turntable in the process chamber 
processing chemicals  deionized water and nitrogen are sequentially dispensed into the chamber through one or more sprayposts mounted in the chamber 
as the turntable rotates  nozzles apply a chemical spray to the wafers surfaces 
after chemical application  deionized water is sprayed on the wafer surfaces and all process chamber surfaces to remove chemical residues 
centrifugal force from the rotation  combined with a flow of nitrogen into the chamber  then dries the wafers and the chamber 
our spray processing systems include a microprocessor based controller to program  control and monitor the system s operating functions to ensure precise control and process repeatability 
the fully automated zeta surface conditioning system  a batch spray processor  is currently available in configurations for both mm and mm wafers 
the zeta products provide a reliable  automated environment to move wafers to and from the process chamber 
this tool s eight chemical flow system allows for a wide range of chemical blend ratios 
in december  we introduced a new generation of zeta surface conditioning systems that improve upon past capabilities through a significant footprint reduction and are intended for use in additional or new process applications 
a semi automated zeta surface conditioning system is capable of processing either mm or mm wafers 
our spray processing systems range in price from  to  to respond to customers who require ozone technology in their device manufacturing processes  we sell an ozonated water generation module for use with our zeta and mercury systems 
our ozone based resist stripping and cleaning technologies are based on our patented and patent pending high concentration ozonated water generation process and dynamic chemical processing 
ozone use in 
table of contents semiconductor processing is attractive because it uses only oxygen and water and can replace sulfuric acid in front end of line feol processing 
this lowers costs related to chemical and water usage and subsequent waste treatment 
vapor processing systems 
our excalibur vapor hf etching systems use anhydrous hydrogen fluoride hf gas in conjunction with water vapor to perform cleaning steps 
the system processes wafers individually  loading them from the wafer carrier into the process chamber by a handler to minimize particle contamination 
vapor hf processing offers advantages over processing systems using liquid chemicals  including increased chemical purity due in part to its ability to mix chemical gases with water vapor at the point of use  reduced chemical and waste disposal costs  and increased processing capabilities 
this integrated system provides environmental and surface control of the wafer between cleaning and various other process steps that results in reduced contamination and improved yield 
the excalibur system ranges in price from  to  depending on the model  wafer size  number of process chambers and related electronic control requirements 
cryokinetic processing systems 
through a license agreement with ibm  we manufacture  market  and service products using ibm s cryogenic aerosol cleaning technology 
we introduced this technology as the aries cryokinetic cleaning system in for semi automated mm manufacturing 
cryokinetic processing is dry and non reactive using frozen argon nitrogen aerosols to remove surface particles through momentum transfer  when the high velocity aerosols impact the particles 
the gas flow carries contaminants away from the wafer and removes them from the process chamber 
in  the aries was replaced with the antares cx advanced cleaning system for mm and mm single wafer  fully automated processing 
the antares cx system removes surface particles which can be either process defects or fab contamination  from sensitive new materials  such as copper and low k dielectric films 
because low k dielectric films can be porous  a dry method such as the cryokinetic technology is especially attractive because it does not alter material properties as the wet and scrub methods can 
antares cx systems range in price from  to  immersion processing systems 
with our acquisition of yieldup international in october  we expanded into immersion processing  allowing us to offer process solutions for the critical cleaning segment of the surface conditioning market 
yieldup systems incorporate our patented surface tension gradient stg drying technology and patented cleanpoint water filtration system 
yieldup s operations were transferred to chaska  minnesota in september the yieldup system is a rinsing and drying system with cleaning options and system control capabilities 
originally designed for mm wafer processing  its capabilities have been expanded to serve smaller wafers as well 
the yieldup module is also available for integration into a wet bench system 
the yieldup system is a two chamber etching  rinsing and drying system that provides integrated hydrofluoric acid etching 
yieldup immersion systems range in price from  to  in june  we introduced the magellan tm immersion clean system 
with this product  we further expanded our immersion processing solutions by providing a system capable of multiple  mainstream cleans  including critical clean  resist strip and etch 
the magellan system is a fully automated immersion cleaning system designed for processing of mm wafers at advanced technology nodes 
it is differentiated from the competition through rapid cycle time  versatility and high performance 
additionally  the footprint is up to smaller than the leading competition 
to date  there have been no sales of the magellan system 
the magellan system ranges in price from  to  
table of contents spare parts and service we sell spare part kits for a number of our products and individual spare part components for our equipment 
we also offer product improvements that enable customers to update previously purchased equipment 
we have customer service and process engineers worldwide  who assist and train customers to perform preventive maintenance on and to service our equipment 
they also develop process applications for the equipment 
we sell a variety of process  service and maintenance programs 
a number of customers have purchased maintenance contracts in which our service employees work at the customer s facility to provide process service and maintenance support for our equipment 
backlog and seasonality our backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer s purchase order has been received or a customer purchase order number has been communicated in writing to us 
our backlog at fiscal year end was million  of which related to the surface conditioning division and related to the microlithography division 
our backlog at fiscal year end was million  of which related to the surface conditioning division and related to the microlithography division 
approximately of our backlog at fiscal year end and of our backlog at fiscal year end was comprised of orders from two customers for each year 
texas instruments and sandia national labs were the top two customers in our fiscal year end backlog 
texas instruments and ibm corporation were the top two customers in our backlog at the end of fiscal the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
all orders are subject to cancellation by the customer and in some cases a penalty provision could apply to a cancellation 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
because of the timing and relative size of certain orders received by us and possible changes in delivery schedules and order cancellations  our backlog can vary from time to time so that backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any subsequent period 
our business is not seasonal to any significant extent 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional sales and backlog information 
research and development we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to enhance  in collaboration with our customers and other equipment and materials manufacturers  our existing product lines to meet the changing needs of microelectronics manufacturers 
we believe that industry trends  such as the use of smaller circuit geometries  increased use of larger substrates and manufacturers increased desire for integrated processing equipment  will make highly automated and integrated systems  including single substrate processing systems  more important to customers 
for assistance in our development efforts  we maintain relationships with our customers and others  who help identify and review industry trends and our development activities to meet the industry s advanced technology needs 
our current research and development programs are focused on the need for cleaner substrate surfaces due to smaller geometries  increased process control and flexibility through monitoring and software management systems and process automation  robotics automation in the cleanroom  and integration of our product offerings with other suppliers products 
each of these programs involves customer and other equipment manufacturers collaboration to ensure proper machine configuration and process development to meet industry requirements 

table of contents we maintain an  square foot  state of the art demonstration and process development laboratory at our surface conditioning division manufacturing facility in chaska  minnesota  and a corresponding  square foot laboratory at our microlithography division in allen  texas 
expenditures for research and development  which are expensed as incurred  during fiscal were approximately  representing of total sales 
expenditures for research and development during fiscal were approximately  representing of total sales  and during fiscal were approximately  exclusive of  of in process research and development write offs  representing of total sales 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
we also recognize the importance of managing product transitions successfully  as the introduction of new products could adversely affect sales of existing products 
marketing  sales and support we market our products worldwide to manufacturers of microelectronic devices 
our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long term relationships with our customers 
these efforts are supported by marketing  sales  and service personnel  along with process and applications engineers that work closely with individual customers to find solutions to their needs 
in north america  we market our products through direct sales personnel  together with product and technical specialists devoted to each of our product lines 
these individuals work with customers to understand their processing requirements and to configure our equipment to provide applications solutions to meet those requirements 
in addition  as of the end of fiscal  the sales effort was supported by approximately employees and contractors engaged in customer service and support 
international sales  primarily in europe and asia  accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal we currently own a equity interest in metron technology bv  a distributor of our products which has an extensive distribution organization located in europe  israel  india  and in the asia pacific region 
in addition to our products  metron technology also sells materials and equipment on behalf of several other semiconductor equipment and consumables manufacturers 
we own a equity interest in m fsi  ltd  a japanese joint venture company formed in with mitsui co  ltd 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  chlorine engineers corp  ltd 
collectively  mitsui 
mitsui owns a equity interest in m fsi 
in connection with its formation  we and mitsui granted m fsi certain product and technology licenses and product distribution rights 
in fiscal year  the majority of our international sales were made to metron technology or m fsi for resale to end users of our products 
in addition to metron technology and m fsi having a direct presence in europe  asia and japan  we augmented their support to customers with several sales and service personnel located in the regions 
in some cases  we may also sell directly to an international customer  in which case we may also pay a commission to our affiliated distributor in connection with the sale 
when commissions are taken into account  the international sales to our affiliates are on terms generally no less favorable to us than international sales by us directly to non affiliates 
on october   we announced the termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology and as of march   we intend to market  sell and service our products through a direct employee base with fsi facilities in europe and asia pacific 
this action is a result of our customers asking us to strengthen our presence in these regions and will allow us to bring customers the full capabilities of our organization 
fsi intends to work closely with metron technology to ensure a successful transition of sales  applications  service and spares logistical functions

table of contents manufacturing  raw materials and suppliers we maintain manufacturing facilities in chaska  minnesota and allen  texas 
we typically assemble our products and systems from components and prefabricated parts manufactured and supplied by others  such as process controllers  robots  integrated circuits  power supplies  stainless steel pressure vessels  chamber bowls  valves and relays 
certain of the items manufactured by others are made to our specifications 
typically  final assembly and systems tests are performed by our manufacturing personnel 
quality control is maintained through quality assurance programs with suppliers  incoming inspection of components  in process inspection during equipment assembly  and final inspection and operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment 
we have a company wide quality program in place and received iso certification in certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers to ensure overall quality and delivery timeliness 
although we seek to reduce dependence on sole and limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary  but that production delays would likely occur in some cases 
further  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse effect on our operating results  delay scheduled deliveries and result in damage to customer relationships 
competition the global semiconductor industry in which we compete is highly competitive 
in each of our markets we face intense competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  research  development  manufacturing  marketing  service and support resources 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support  and manage our operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that our products will continue to be viewed as competitive as a result of technological advances by competitors or changes in semiconductor technology 
our competitors also may increase their efforts to gain and retain market share through competitive pricing  strategic alliances or mergers and acquisitions 
such competitive pressures may require us to reduce prices or may result in lost orders that could adversely affect our financial results 
if our competitors enter into strategic alliances with leading semiconductor manufacturers in the areas of surface conditioning or microlithography  this could impair our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our operating results 
significant competitive factors in the equipment market include system price  quality  process repeatability  capability and flexibility  ability to integrate with other products  process or tool of record  incumbency and overall cost of ownership  including reliability  automation  throughput  system price and customer support 
we have experienced significant price competition from certain competitors  primarily those in the microlithography market 
however  we believe that we have the strategies in place to develop technological advantages over our competitors 
to realize and maintain these advantages will require a continued high level of investment by us in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support as well as controlling operating expenses 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our competitors differ across our product lines 
our microlithography products compete with products offered by  among others  tokyo electron ltd  dainippon screen manufacturing co 
ltd 
and asm lithography 
our surface conditioning products compete with  among others  dainippon screen manufacturing co 
ltd  kaijo denki  mattson technology  sankyo sugai  semitool  inc  scp global technologies  the sez group  applied materials and tokyo electron ltd 

table of contents customers we sell products from one or more of our product lines to most major microelectronics manufacturers 
we have an extensive history of sales to several of the largest integrated circuit manufacturers and we have over active customers worldwide 
texas instruments accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  of our total sales in fiscal and of our total sales in fiscal ibm accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal and less than in each of fiscal and philips semiconductor accounted for approximately of our sales in fiscal and less than in each of fiscal and stmicroelectronics accounted for approximately of our sales in fiscal  and less than in each of fiscal and we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in our customer mix 
the timing of an order for our equipment is primarily dependent upon the customer s expansion program  replacement needs  or requirements to improve productivity and yields 
consequently  a customer who places significant orders in one year will not necessarily place significant orders in subsequent years 
sales to metron technology and m fsi  our international distributors  accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  of our total sales in fiscal and of our total sales in fiscal usually these systems are purchased for resale to device manufacturers 
on october   we announced the termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology effective march  metron technology will continue to represent fsi products in israel

under the m fsi distribution agreement  m fsi has exclusive distribution rights with respect to certain of our products in japan 
a licensing agreement allows m fsi to manufacture certain of our products 
the agreements may be terminated only upon the occurrence of certain events or conditions 
there is no obligation under the distribution agreement for m fsi to purchase a specified amount or percentage of our products 
patents  trademarks and intellectual property our success depends upon a variety of factors  including proprietary technology 
it is becoming increasingly important to protect our technology by obtaining and enforcing patents 
consequently  we have an active program to file patent applications in the united states and other countries on inventions we consider significant 
we also possess other proprietary intellectual property  including trademarks  know how  trade secrets and copyrights 
we also protect our proprietary information through non disclosure agreements with our employees and with third parties 
we have a number of patents in the united states and other countries  and additional applications are pending 
these patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or may not provide any competitive advantages to us 
there are no assurances that pending applications will result in patents or that the claims allowed in future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
the laws of some foreign countries may not permit the protection of our proprietary rights to the same extent as under the laws of the united states 
although we believe that protection afforded by our patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property rights has value  because of rapidly changing technology  our future success is primarily dependent on our employees engineering  marketing  service and manufacturing skills 
in the normal course of business  we from time to time receive and make inquiries about possible patent infringement 
in dealing with such inquiries  it may be necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights 
however  there can be no assurance that such license rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the inability to obtain certain license or other rights  or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation could have a material adverse effect on us

royalties are based on the royalty portion revenues of licensed equipment that excludes amounts for freight  taxes  customers duties  insurance  discounts  and certain equipment not manufactured by us 
we have approximately us patents 
expiration dates range from to employees as of august   we had approximately employees 
competition for highly skilled employees is intense 
we believe that a great part of our future success depends upon our continued ability to retain and attract qualified employees 
we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and have never been subject to a work stoppage 
we believe we have good relations with our employees 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process 
we believe we are in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  fines could be imposed  production could be suspended  or operations could cease 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or take other actions to comply with environmental regulations at a potentially significant cost to us 
if we fail to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of  hazardous substances we could incur future liabilities

item legal proceedings we generate minor amounts of liquid and solid hazardous waste and use licensed haulers and disposal facilities to ship and dispose of such waste 
in the past  we have received notice from state or federal enforcement agencies that we are a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation of several hazardous waste disposal sites owned and operated by third parties 
in each matter  we have elected to participate in settlement offers made to all de minimis parties with respect to such sites 
the risk of being named a prp is that if any of the other prp s are unable to contribute their proportionate share of the liability  if any  associated with the site  those prp s that are able could be held financially responsible for the shortfall 
there has recently been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the microelectronics industry 
commercialization of new products or further commercialization of our current products could provoke claims of infringement by third parties 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort by us  which by itself could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
further  adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling one or more products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our product lines are intended for use with hazardous chemicals 
as a result  we are notified by our customers from time to time of incidents involving our equipment that have resulted in a spill or release of a hazardous chemical 
in some cases it may be alleged that we or our equipment are at fault 
there can be no assurance that any future litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results 
in the fall of  pursuant to the employee stock purchase and shareholder agreement dated november  between eric c 
hsu and semiconductor systems  inc ssi the shareholder agreement and in connection with mr 
hsu s termination of his employment with ssi in august  the former shareholders of ssi purchased the shares of ssi common stock then held by mr 
hsu 
in april  we acquired ssi  and ssi became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in october  eric c 
and angie l 
hsu the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the superior court of california  county of alameda  southern division  against ssi and the former shareholders of ssi 
the plaintiffs alleged that such purchase breached the shareholder agreement and violated the california corporations code  breached the fiduciary duty owed plaintiffs by the individual defendants and constituted fraud 
in september and october  certain of mr 
hsu s claims were tried to a jury in alameda county superior court in oakland  california 
at the conclusion of the trial  the jury found that ssi breached the shareholder agreement between it and mr 
hsu and that the damages that resulted were approximately million 
in addition  each of the individual defendant shareholders was found liable for conversion and damages of million were awarded 
certain individual defendants were also found to have intentionally interfered with mr 
hsu s prospective economic advantage and damages of million were awarded 
finally  several individual defendants and ssi were found to have violated certain provisions of the california corporation code and damages of million were awarded 

table of contents in proceedings subsequent to the trial  the court determined that plaintiffs are entitled to an award against ssi of prejudgment interest on the breach of contract damages approximately million at percent per annum from october in addition  the court awarded plaintiffs approximately  in costs and approximately million in attorneys fees against ssi and the individual defendants 
on november   the court signed its final judgment reflecting the jury s awards  interest  attorneys fees and costs assessed against each of the defendants 
following the entry of judgment  ssi and the other defendants filed post trial motions seeking reduction in the jury s damage awards and or a new trial 
the court denied these post trial motions and there was no reduction in damages against ssi 
subsequent to february   mr 
hsu was awarded an additional  for attorneys fees and expenses incurred since the judgment was rendered in november the total judgment against ssi together with post judgment interest and attorneys fees as of august  aggregated approximately million 
ssi and the individual defendants have filed an appeal on a variety of grounds  and we posted an appeal bond on behalf of ssi and defendants in the amount of million 
as part of the posting of the bond  we entered into a letter of credit in the amount of million with a surety company 
this letter of credit was collateralized with restricted cash of approximately the same amount 
we  on behalf of ssi  have made a claim with respect to the lawsuit under the escrow created at the time of our acquisition of ssi 
the escrow was established to secure certain indemnification obligations of the former shareholders of ssi 
the escrow consists of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock paid to the former shareholders of ssi as consideration in the acquisition 
the former shareholders have agreed to hold us and ssi harmless from any claim arising out of any securities transactions between ssi and the shareholders or former shareholders of ssi 
the indemnification obligations of the individual ssi shareholders are capped at approximately million in the aggregate 
any shares in the escrow returned to us to satisfy any indemnification obligations will be valued at per share  the per share price of our common stock at the time of the ssi acquisition 
given the escrowed shares and the additional indemnification by the individual ssi shareholders  along with our litigation reserve  we believe we are adequately reserved for this potential liability 
however  there is considerable uncertainty as to the ultimate resolution of this matter and the respective liability  if any  of ssi 
we will continue with its appeal process and defense 
in september  cfm technologies  inc and cfmt  inc 
collectively cfm filed a complaint in united states district court for the district of delaware against yieldup 
yieldup was acquired by us in october yieldup is now known as scd mountain view  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
the complaint alleged that the drying process incorporated in certain yieldup products infringes a patent held by cfm 
on october   the united states district court held that cfm had failed to produce evidence on three separate elements of the patent claim 
on june   the united states district court of delaware granted cfm s petition for re argument of the issue 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the re argument of the issue was held and the court has ruled not to sustain the judge s earlier ruling 
as a result  the litigation may proceed to trial  and the litigation and the associated costs may  and an unfavorable adjudication could  have a material adverse impact on us 
cfm is asking for monetary damages and an injunction against yieldup s use of the products at issue

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry update the microelectronics industry has been cyclical in nature and has experienced periodic downturns 
after a severe industry contraction  conditions for integrated circuit and semiconductor equipment manufacturers started to improve for the few months leading up to september  however  for approximately a six month period after the terrorist attacks  primarily impacted by shaken consumer confidence and weak global economic conditions  the industry recovery stalled 
starting late in the first quarter of calendar  microelectronics manufacturers began to realize stronger demand for integrated circuits 
the increase in semiconductor device demand  coupled with the closing of a number of older generation device fabrication facilities  contributed to a significant increase in capacity utilization for many manufacturers 
their utilization rates  on average  increased from to percent in november and december to over percent by september the increased demand for devices  coupled with semiconductor manufacturers need to produce devices with smaller features  copper metal interconnects and better dielectric or insulating materials  contributed to an increase in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
in addition  in an effort to reduce the cost of devices  semiconductor manufacturers increased their investments in equipment capable of processing mm diameter wafers as compared to the significant investment in mm process equipment during the last cycle 
with concerns about a pending war with iraq  a slowing in the rate of the economic recovery and weak business and consumer demand for products containing microelectronics  the industry recovery began to stall out again in the fall of as a result  industry analysts forecasts for a sustainable industry recovery were pushed out until the second half of calendar on a calendar year basis  demand for semiconductor devices decreased percent in after increasing approximately percent in device demand is currently forecasted by analysts to increase a modest to percent in calendar  as compared to the prior year and is expected to improve by more than percent in calendar semiconductor equipment revenues decreased percent in calendar  after recognizing unprecedented growth of over percent in with the anticipation of weaker than normal consumer electronics demand during the holiday buying period  analysts are forecasting demand for fabrication equipment to decrease to percent in calendar analysts are predicting an overall industry recovery in the second half of calendar  resulting in a year over year to percent increase in demand for semiconductor equipment 
the anticipated industry improvement is dependent upon an economic recovery  improved consumer confidence  increased business spending on information technology infrastructure and stronger sustained demand for consumer electronics 
we believe that any significant increase in equipment spending by device manufacturers will be led by the investment in mm capacity  smaller device feature sizes  and process technology required for new materials such as copper and low k dielectrics 
these are all technology areas where we have successfully industry sources include gartner dataquest  vlsi research  inc and semiconductor industry association 

table of contents focused our research and development investment the past few years and represent applications for which we have been receiving orders during the past to months 
application of critical accounting policies in accordance with recent securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory obsolescence  allowance for doubtful accounts and assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder of the total revenue recognized as the earning process is completed for other elements 
all other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance 
future revenues may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet customer specific acceptance criteria 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the mix of revenue recognized upon shipment versus acceptance and for revenue recognized upon acceptance  it is dependent upon when the acceptance certificates are actually received or customer specific criteria are met 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we do determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or another valuation technique 
net intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of august  in  statement of financial accounting standards safs no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we did not record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
due to a significant decline in our stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the continued downturn in the industry and overall global economic conditions  we completed an impairment review as of august  as a result  the balance of the goodwill was deemed other than temporarily impaired  and we 
table of contents recorded a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal our investment in our affiliate  metron technology  is accounted for by the equity method of accounting and has a carrying value on the balance sheet as of august  of approximately million or per share 
the fair value of metron technology is subject to stock market fluctuations 
the stock price of metron technology ranged from to per share during fiscal based on the closing stock price of metron technology of per share on august   the fair value of our investment in metron technology was approximately million  or million less than the carrying value on our balance sheet 
while we determined at august  that our investment in metron technology was not other than temporarily impaired  our decision on october  to use metron technology shares with a value of to settle the termination fee payment with metron technology triggered an impairment loss on that date for all of the shares we held 
accordingly  the difference between our per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon in the transition agreement on the shares held will be recorded as a non cash impairment charge in our quarter ending november  under our policy  we will continue to review our long term investment in affiliates for other than temporary impairment as deemed necessary 
product warranty estimation we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  anticipated releases of new products and other factors 
the warranty periods range from to months 
although management believes the likelihood to be relatively low  claims experience could be materially different from actual results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
inventory reserves estimation we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon historical loss trends  inventory levels  physical inventory and cycle count adjustments  expected product lives and forecasted sales demand 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of the industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry or by us 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
the most significant risk is the risk of sudden unexpected deterioration in financial condition of a significant customer which is not considered in the allowance 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
results could be materially impacted if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorated and related receivables are deemed uncollectible 
litigation liability estimation management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management is not always able to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 

table of contents as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
recent developments on october   we entered into a transition agreement with metron technology related to the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology for europe and the asia pacific region  effective march  closing date 
under the terms of the transition agreement  we will assume direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our surface conditioning and microlithography products in europe and the asia pacific region as of the closing date  while metron technology will continue to represent fsi products in israel 
in conjunction with this transaction  we will advance up to million to metron technology on a secured basis 
on the closing date  the advance will be applied toward the repurchase by us of inventory and equipment that metron technology currently holds to support its obligations under the current distribution arrangement 
under the terms of the transition agreement  we have agreed to pay metron technology on the closing date an early termination fee of approximately million 
subject to approval by metron technology s shareholders  we will surrender on the closing date approximately million metron technology common shares now owned by us in payment of this early termination fee 
we will record a non cash charge of approximately million to selling  general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of fiscal associated with the early termination fee 
we will also record a non cash impairment charge of approximately million to other expense in the first quarter of fiscal associated with utilizing shares of our metron technology stock as consideration for the payment of the early termination fee 
if metron technology s shareholders do not approve our surrender of shares as payment of the early termination fee  we may be required to make a cash payment of million 
in addition  we will also record a non cash impairment charge of approximately million to other expense for the million shares of metron technology that we will continue to own after surrendering the million shares of metron technology stock to metron technology 
the impairment charges are based upon the difference between our per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon per the transition agreement 
it is anticipated that approximately metron technology employees who are currently dedicated to sales  technical service and applications engineering activities related to the distribution of our products in europe and the asia pacific region will be offered employment by us on the closing date 
we would own million shares  or approximately of metron technology  after the transaction closes on march  the transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions  including approval by the metron technology shareholders of the use of the stock we own in metron technology as consideration for the termination fee 
results of operations in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sec staff addressed several issues in sab  including the timing of revenue recognition for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product if these events occur after shipment and transfer of title 
historically  we generally recognized system revenue when the product was shipped  risk of loss had passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable was probable 
under the new accounting method  we changed our method of accounting for system sales to generally recognize revenue once the system s pre determined specifications or acceptance criteria are met 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we implemented the provisions of sab  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal this was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of august  this change resulted in a cumulative change in accounting principle of approximately million  net of taxes  or 
table of contents a charge of per share 
pro forma amounts for the periods beginning before august  have not been presented as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not be reasonably determined 
sab may add additional cycle time between order acceptance booking and revenue 
our goal is to minimize the impact of cycle time  but our systems are complex instruments and can require lengthy installation and integration into the fab 
therefore  we expect that sab will result in a slower revenue ramp when bookings are accelerating and a slower revenue decline when bookings are decelerating 
due to a significant decline in our stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the continued downturn in the industry and the overall global economic conditions  an impairment review of goodwill was completed as of august  as a result  the balance of goodwill was deemed other than temporarily impaired and we recorded a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  in response to the continued delay in an industry recovery and the overall economy  we implemented cost reduction actions which included a reduction in the overall workforce  salary cuts for all employees  a decrease in planned capital expenditures and a reduction in other discretionary costs 
we recorded approximately  of realignment charges in the second quarter  primarily related to severance costs 
the realignment charges were allocated as follows  to cost of goods sold   to selling  general and administrative expense and  to research and development expense 
in fiscal  we implemented cost reduction plans including two reduction in workforce programs  merit increase delays  executive salary cuts of and a reduction in other discretionary spending costs 
as a result  we recorded million in realignment charges associated with reduction in forces that occurred in march and june of these costs were allocated as follows  to cost of goods sold  million to selling  general and administrative expense and  to research and development expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced an infrastructure realignment program that included closing our mountain view and fremont  california facilities and the discontinuance of production of our nickel iron plating product 
we recorded realignment charges of approximately million consisting of approximately million of cost of goods sold  million of selling  general and administrative expense and million of research and development expense 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million in process research and development write off related to the acquisition of yieldup and a gain of million related to the sale of  shares of metron technology s common stock held by us 
sales revenue and shipments as previously discussed  we implemented sab on august   the beginning of fiscal in general  under sab  we defer revenue on certain system shipments until final acceptance is received from the customer  whereas  under historical accounting methods  revenue was generally recognized at the time of shipment 
sab does not require the restatement of fiscal results 
fiscal sab revenues were million as compared to million in fiscal sales revenues for the microlithography division decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales revenues for the surface conditioning division decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal both the microlithography division and surface conditioning division experienced revenue decreases due to the industry downturn  competitive pricing pressures and the global recession 
fiscal sab revenues were million and fiscal shipments were million 
sales revenue in fiscal was million on a shipment basis 
revenues decreased for the surface conditioning division for the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year with an offsetting increase in the microlithography division 
sales revenues for the surface conditioning division segment 
table of contents decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales revenues for the microlithography division segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal shipments were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decline in shipments was due to the industry downturn  competitive pricing pressures and the global recession 
both divisions experienced shipment decreases from to microlithography division shipments decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal surface conditioning division shipments decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in shipments from fiscal to was primarily related to microlithography division products 
microlithography division shipments increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal surface conditioning division shipments increased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal international sales were million  representing of total sales during fiscal  million  representing of total sales during fiscal  and million  representing of total sales during fiscal international sales are primarily through our affiliates  metron technology and m fsi  and represented approximately of international sales during fiscal  of international sales during fiscal and of international sales during fiscal the decrease in international sales in fiscal occurred in all regions 
due to its broader customer base  the surface conditioning division has a higher percentage of international sales than the microlithography division 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s international sales 
we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million  as compared to million at the end of fiscal backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer purchase order has been received or a customer purchase order number has been communicated in writing to us 
because of the timing and relative size of orders and the possibility of cancellations or customer delays  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for future periods 
deferred revenue was approximately million as of the end of fiscal deferred revenue is included in deferred profit which is net of deferred cost of goods sold on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the fiscal year end backlog and deferred revenue levels  we expect first quarter fiscal revenue to be in the range of to million 
we also expect first quarter orders to be below the fourth quarter of fiscal level of million 
gross profit our gross profit margin fluctuates due to a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  as surface conditioning products generally have higher margins than the microlithography products  the proportion of international sales  as international sales generally have lower margins as a result of selling through distributors  competitive pricing pressures and utilization of manufacturing capacity 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in margins was primarily related to lower manufacturing capacity utilization and competitive pricing pressures 
also  during the year we increased our inventory obsolescence reserve to account for the transition to the next generation products 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the year over year improvement was primarily due to improved capacity utilization associated with higher shipments  the consolidation of operations into two facilities  success of our cost reduction programs and related standard product margin improvements 
the margin improvement was offset by a higher percentage of foreign sales  which generally carry lower margins 
margins were also negatively impacted by additional inventory write offs and reserves and by cancellation penalties paid to subsystem suppliers and severance costs 

table of contents the increase in inventory reserves  net for fiscal as compared to  was million 
the decrease in inventory reserves  net from fiscal to fiscal  was million and was primarily due to the write off and disposal of obsolete inventory against the reserve as we consolidated the mountain view and fremont operations into other facilities 
we expect the gross profit margins for the first quarter of fiscal to decrease to to of revenues due to a lower mix of higher margin surface conditioning products and the continued under utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales  in fiscal and million  or of total sales  in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal reflects the cost reduction actions implemented during the second half of fiscal  lower incentive compensation payments that resulted from lower orders and operating return on revenue 
the decrease also reflects a million reduction in amortization expense in fiscal the reduction in amortization expense was related to the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the decrease was significantly offset by a litigation reserve for attorneys fees and other appeal costs in fiscal of approximately million and the impairment charge to goodwill of million recorded by the surface conditioning division 
the slight decrease in the selling  general and administrative dollar amount for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to reduced administration and information technology expenses and lower commissions and profit enhancement plan expenses due to lower order activity and operating losses 
this decrease was offset by increased customer service costs due to higher travel expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include realignment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal are expected to increase slightly to to million as we begin to incur incremental costs associated with establishing our direct distribution organization in europe and the asia pacific region 
in addition  we will record a non cash charge of approximately million to selling  general and administrative expenses in the first quarter associated with the early termination of the distribution agreements with metron technology 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal and million  or of total sales  for fiscal the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to timing of expenses associated with key product development programs and cost reduction actions 
a significant portion of our research and development investment in was directed at reducing product costs  the magellan tm product development initiative  improving product reliability and expanding the application capabilities of a number of our products 
there was a one time in process research and development iprd write off of million relating to the yieldup acquisition recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year research and development expenses included realignment charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal our average investment on new product and process development programs as a percent of total sales has been approximately for the past three years 
we will continue to remain focused on critical technologies and strategically investing our research and development dollars  specifically in the immersion technology for surface conditioning products and mm products for both resist processing and surface conditioning 

table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net was approximately million of income  or of total sales for fiscal as compared to million of income  or of total sales for fiscal and million of income  or of total sales  for fiscal the decrease in amounts for fiscal as compared to fiscal relates to a decline in interest rates  offset by higher average cash and marketable securities balances in fiscal than in fiscal the decrease in amounts for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the million gain from the sale of metron technology s stock in we recognized the gain on the sale of approximately  shares of metron technology s stock in its initial public offering during the first quarter of fiscal interest expense is expected to be minimal for us in fiscal year interest income is expected to be approximately  to  for the first quarter of fiscal  given our current level of cash reserves and the anticipated interest rates 
we expect to record an approximately million non cash impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal associated with utilizing million shares of its metron technology stock as consideration for the payment of the early termination fee to metron technology 
in addition  we will also record a non cash impairment charge of approximately million for the million shares of metron technology that we will continue to own after surrendering the million shares of metron technology stock to metron technology 
the impairment charges are based upon the difference between our per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon per the transition agreement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit expense we recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal this benefit was primarily a result of a refund that became available due to a tax law revision enacted in the third quarter of fiscal we filed the appropriate federal tax returns and received a cash refund of approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded tax expense of  for fiscal and for fiscal the tax expense in fiscal related to state tax expense in states that do not allow loss carrybacks and tax expense related to the utilization of yieldup net operating losses and a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
our deferred tax assets on the balance sheet as of august  have been fully reserved for with a valuation allowance

this limitation is approximately  per year 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates was approximately  of losses for fiscal  million of income for fiscal  and million of income for fiscal the loss in fiscal was due to the impact that deteriorating industry conditions had on metron technology and m fsi

liquidity and capital resources our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million as of august   an increase of million from the end of fiscal the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to million of net proceeds from the private placement of common stock in april we also had proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances of million 
we purchased million of property  plant and equipment acquisitions and used cash of million for operating activities 
we remain focused on preserving cash to meet our working capital requirements during the growth phase of the next industry cycle 
accounts receivable decreased million from the end of fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to the decrease in fourth quarter shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal inventory decreased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in inventory was primarily in raw materials offset by an increase in work in process  of which the majority will be shipped in the first half of fiscal inventory reserves were million at the end of fiscal  of which of the reserves related to the surface conditioning division and related to the microlithography division 
this is compared to million of inventory reserves at the end of fiscal of which of the reserves related to the surface conditioning division and related to the microlithography division

in the third quarter of fiscal  we posted an appeal bond on behalf of ssi and defendants in the amount of million 
as part of the posting of the bond  we entered into a letter of credit in the amount of million with the surety company 
this letter of credit is collateralized with restricted cash of approximately the same amount 
the total balance of restricted cash as of august  was million 

table of contents acquisitions of property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect capital expenditures to be between and million in fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal is expected to be between approximately and million 
at the first quarter expected run rate  excluding the up to million advance to metron technology  we anticipate using approximately to million of cash for operations 
we believe that with existing cash  cash receipts  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds  there will be sufficient funds to meet our currently projected working capital requirements  to pay the million termination fee to metron technology if required to be paid in cash and to meet other cash requirements through at least fiscal we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
one of our strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  to consider divestitures  investments or acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies particularly those that are complementary to our surface conditioning business 
we may fund such activities with additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  whether to maintain flexibility or to meet strategic objectives  could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board approved sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  this statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  this statement retains the requirement of apb no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
this statement also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
we are required and plan to adopt the provision of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
risk factors our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information and risks set forth in this report 

table of contents because our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment  downturns in the microelectronics industry may adversely affect our results 
the microelectronics industry experiences periodic downturns  which may have a negative effect on our sales and operating results 
our business depends on the amounts that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment 
the amounts they spend on capital equipment depend on the existing and expected demand for semiconductor devices and products that use semiconductor devices 
the microelectronics industry has experienced downturns in business activity in the past  and the industry currently is experiencing a significant downturn 
when a downturn occurs  some semiconductor manufacturers experience lower demand and increased pricing pressure for their products 
as a result  they are likely to purchase less semiconductor processing equipment and have sometimes delayed making decisions to purchase capital equipment 
in some cases  semiconductor manufacturers have canceled or delayed orders for our products 
the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn in and  which seriously harmed our operating results during that period 
typically  the semiconductor equipment industry has experienced more pronounced decreases in net sales than the semiconductor industry as a whole 
we  along with others in the industry  have recently experienced a significant downturn in orders for new equipment as well as delays in or cancellations of existing orders 
we cannot predict the extent and length of the current downturn 
in addition the semiconductor industry may experience other  possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future  any future recovery of the semiconductor industry may not result in an increased demand by semiconductor manufacturers for capital equipment or our products  and the semiconductor industry may not improve in the near future or at all 
if we do not continue to develop new products  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our business and results of operations could decline if we do not develop and successfully introduce new or improved products that the market accepts 
the technology used in microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes changes rapidly 
industry standards change constantly and equipment manufacturers frequently introduce new products 
we believe that microelectronics manufacturers increasingly rely on equipment manufacturers like us to design and develop more efficient manufacturing equipment  design and implement improved processes for microelectronics manufacturers to use  and make their equipment compatible with equipment made by other equipment manufacturers 
to compete  we must continue to develop  manufacture  and market new or improved products that meet changing industry standards 
to do this successfully  we must select appropriate products  design and develop our products efficiently and quickly  implement our manufacturing and assembly processes efficiently and on time  make products that perform well for our customers  market and sell our products effectively  and introduce our new products in a way that does not unexpectedly reduce sales of our existing products 

table of contents failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition 
we believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology  particularly mm products 
market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors  including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products  ability to displace incumbent suppliers or processes or tools of record  perceived advantages over competing products  and the level of customer service available to support such products 
moreover  manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs 
as a result  market acceptance of our products may be affected adversely to the extent potential customers utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
there can be no assurance that sales of new products will remain constant or grow or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our systems and technology 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new systems and enhance existing systems 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  we will make these expenditures well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of any new systems 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new systems is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle  including start up bugs  design defects and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems to the marketplace 
in addition  since our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our systems  our anticipated product orders may not materialize or orders that do materialize may be canceled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our systems in order to recoup research and development expenditures 
the failure of any of our new products to achieve market acceptance would harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations and cash flows 
product or process development problems could harm our results of operations 
our products are complex  and from time to time have defects or bugs that are difficult and costly to fix 
this can harm our results of operations in the following ways we may incur substantial costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of products early in their life cycle  repeated defects or bugs can reduce orders  increase manufacturing costs  adversely impact working capital and increase service and warranty expenses  and we may require significant lead times between product introduction and commercialization 
as a result  we may have to write off inventory and other assets related to products and could lose customers and revenue 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing product and process development problems that could potentially harm our results of operations 
future acquisitions may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and have other adverse consequences 
because of consolidations in the semiconductor equipment industry we serve and other competitive factors  our management will seek to acquire additional product lines  technologies  and businesses if suitable opportunities develop 
acquisitions may result in the issuance of our stock  which may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and reduce earnings per share 
acquisitions also may increase debt levels 
table of contents and the related goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in absorbing the new business  product line  or technology  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entering new markets in which we have little or no experience  and possible loss of key employees of the acquired business 
certain of our long lived assets have and others may become other than temporarily impaired  including our investment in affiliates 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our million balance of goodwill was deemed other than temporarily impaired and a charge of million was recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses 
our investment in our affiliate  metron technology  has a carrying value on the balance sheet of approximately million 
the fair value of metron technology is subject to stock market fluctuations 
based on the closing stock price of metron technology of per share on august   the fair value of our investment in metron technology was approximately million  or million less than the carrying value on our balance sheet 
while we determined at august  that our investment in metron technology was not other than temporarily impaired  our decision on october  to use metron technology shares with a value of to settle the termination payment with metron technology triggered an impairment loss on that date for all of the shares we held 
accordingly  the difference between our per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon per the transition agreement on the shares held will be recorded as a non cash impairment charge in our quarter ending november  there can be no assurance that additional impairment charges will not be necessary depending on future economic conditions 
because of the volatility of our stock price  the ability to trade fsi shares may be adversely affected and our ability to raise capital through future equity financing may be reduced 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future 
in the fiscal year  for example  our stock price ranged from to per share 
the trading price of our common shares is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the following failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts for a given quarterly period  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  press releases or announcements by  or changes in market values of  comparable companies  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which are particularly common among securities of high technology companies  stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels  additions or departures of key personnel  and involvement in or adverse results from litigation 
the prices of technology stocks  including ours  have been particularly affected by extreme fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market generally 
these broad stock market fluctuations may have a negative effect on our future stock price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
in the future we could be the target of this type of litigation 
securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which can seriously harm our business 

table of contents because our quarterly operating results are volatile  our stock price could decrease 
in the past  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations may have a significant impact on our stock price 
the reasons for the fluctuations in our operating results  such as sales  gross profits  and net income  include the timing of significant customer orders and customer spending patterns 
during industry downturns  our customers may ask us to delay or even cancel the shipment of equipment orders 
delays and cancellations may adversely affect our operating results in any particular quarter if we are unable to recognize revenue for particular sales in the quarter in which we expected those sales 
the timing of new product and service announcements by us or our competitors 
new product announcements by us and our competitors could cause our customers to delay a purchase or to decide to purchase products of one of our competitors which would adversely affect our revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
new product announcements by others may make it necessary for us to reduce prices on our products or offer more service options  which could adversely impact operating margins and net income 
the mix of products sold and the market acceptance of our new product lines 
the mix of products we sell varies from period to period  and because margins vary among or within different product lines  this can adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to sell our products which generate higher margins  our average gross margins may be lower than expected 
if we fail to sell our new product lines  our revenue may be lower than expected 
general global economic conditions or economic conditions in a particular region 
when economic conditions in a region or worldwide worsen  customers may delay or cancel their orders 
there also may be an increase in the time it takes to collect payment from our customers or even outright payment defaults 
this can negatively affect our cash flow and our results 
as a result of these factors  our future operating results are difficult to predict 
further  we base our current and future expense plans in significant part on our expectations of our longer term future revenue 
as a result  we expect our expense levels to be relatively fixed in the short run 
an unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter 
if our revenue is below our projections  then our operating results will also be below expectations 
any one of the factors we list above  or a combination of them  could adversely affect our quarterly results of operations  and consequently may cause a decline in our share price 
because of our equity position in our affiliated distributors  adverse results of these affiliates could adversely affect our results 
the profits or losses of our affiliated distributors  metron technology bv and m fsi ltd  can also significantly affect our financial results 
as of august   we had a ownership interest in metron technology and a interest in m fsi 
metron technology and m fsi also distribute or sell products for companies other than us 
if these affiliates lose the business of a significant company for which they distribute or sell products  lose a significant customer  or otherwise became less financially viable  it could have a negative effect on our financial condition 
the transition of our european and asia pacific sales and service from our distributor  metron technology  to a direct model may result in additional costs and risks 
sales through metron technology for fiscal were million  or of our total sales 
on october   we entered into a transition agreement with metron technology related to the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology for europe and the asia pacific region effective march  under the terms of the transition agreement  we will assume direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our surface conditioning and microlithography products in europe and the asia pacific region as of the closing date  while metron technology will continue to represent our products in israel 

table of contents it is anticipated that approximately metron technology employees who are currently dedicated to sales  technical service and applications engineering activities related to the distribution of our products in europe and the asia pacific region will be offered employment with us at the closing date 
our success in selling our products direct in these regions will be dependent upon hiring and retaining key support employees  implementing targeted marketing plans and developing direct relationships with our international customers key procurement personnel 
because of our limited experience in selling our products directly in europe and the asia pacific region  we expect to incur additional costs during the ramp up period 
the success of our transition to a primarily direct sales model in europe and the asia pacific region may be adversely impacted if we fail to have the appropriate systems and processes in place as of the closing date 
failure to close the transition agreement with metron technology could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common shares 
the transition agreement with metron technology  whereby our distribution arrangements with metron technology will be substantially terminated  is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions prior to effectiveness 
these conditions include metron technology shareholder approval to the use by us of our metron technology common stock to satisfy the early termination fee and the transfer of certain permits and product registrations from metron technology to us 
if such conditions are not satisfied  or the early termination does not occur for any reason  we may experience the following adverse effects the market price of our common shares may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the transition will be completed  costs related to the transition agreement and the termination of the distribution agreements  such as legal fees and costs associated with preparing the infrastructure necessary to sell direct  will have been incurred and must be paid even if the transition is not completed  and the diversion of our management from our day to day business and the unavoidable disruption to our employees and our relationships with customers during the transition period may make it difficult for us to regain our market position if the transition does not occur 
changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may reduce our international sales 
almost all of our direct international sales are denominated in us dollars 
nonetheless  changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect our international sales 
historically  most of our international sales  however  were through our affiliated distributors 
metron technology s sales of our products and other companies products are denominated primarily in us dollars  but metron technology s expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect metron technology s financial results 
sales for m fsi are denominated in yen 
as a result  us dollar yen exchange rates may affect our equity interest in m fsi s earnings 
metron technology and m fsi sometimes engage in so called hedging or risk reducing transactions to try to limit the negative effects that the devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have on operating results 
they will do so if a sale denominated in a foreign currency is sufficiently large to justify the costs of hedging 
to hedge a sale  metron technology or m fsi typically will commit to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at a given price at a future date 
if the customer cancels the sale  metron technology or m fsi may be forced to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at market rates to meet its hedging obligations and may incur a loss in doing so 
to date  the hedging activities of metron technology and m fsi have not had any significant negative effect on us 
the adoption of sfas by metron technology and m fsi may cause more volatility in our equity in earnings of affiliates 

table of contents because of our plan to assume direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we expect to incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
we intend to evaluate various hedging activities and other options to minimize fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing foreign exchange rate risks and such failure may reduce our international sales or negatively impact our operating results 
because of the need to meet and comply with numerous foreign regulations and policies  the changeability of the political and economic environments in foreign jurisdictions and the difficulty of managing business overseas  we may not be able to sustain our historical level of international sales 
we and our affiliates operate in a global market 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
in fiscal  this figure was 
these figures include sales through metron technology and m fsi  which accounted for of international sales in fiscal  of international sales in fiscal  and of international sales in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
sales to customers outside the united states involve a number of risks  including the following imposition of government controls  compliance with us export laws and foreign laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in taxes and tariffs  longer payment cycles  difficulty of administering business overseas  and general economic conditions 
in particular  the japanese and asia pacific markets are extremely competitive 
the semiconductor device manufacturers located there are very aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers  including equipment manufacturers like us 
in fiscal  approximately of our international sales were attributable to these markets 
we seek to meet technical standards imposed by foreign regulatory bodies 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with those standards in the future 
any failure by us to design products to comply with foreign standards could have a significant negative impact on us 
because of the significant financial resources needed to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support and to invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors 
the microelectronics equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will need significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support  and to invest in research and development 
we believe that the microelectronics industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have the resources to support customers on a worldwide basis 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and customer support capabilities than us 
large equipment manufacturers have or may enter the market areas in which we compete 
in addition  smaller  emerging microelectronics equipment companies provide innovative technology 
we expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes 
we also expect them to introduce new products and processes with better performance and pricing 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to compete effectively in the united states or elsewhere 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents because we do not have long term sales commitments with our customers  if these customers decide to reduce  delay or cancel orders or choose to deal with our competitors  then our results will be adversely affected 
if our significant customers  including ibm  texas instruments  stmicroelectronics or philips semiconductor  reduce  delay  or cancel orders  then our operating results could suffer 
our largest customers have changed from year to year  however  sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal ibm accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal texas instruments accounted for of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal philips semiconductor accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal stmicroelectronics represented of total revenues in fiscal we currently have no long term sales commitments with any of our customers 
instead  we generally make sales under purchase orders 
our backlog at august  was million of which was comprised of orders from two customers 
all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer 
our backlog may not result in future net sales 
we schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
in addition  while we evaluate each customer order on a case by case basis to determine qualification for inclusion in backlog  there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog ultimately will result in future sales 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales  could harm our business 
it may be difficult for us to compete with stronger competitors resulting from industry consolidation 
in the past several years  we have seen a trend toward consolidation in the microelectronics equipment industry 
we expect the trend toward consolidation to continue as companies seek to strengthen or maintain their market positions in a rapidly changing industry 
we believe that industry consolidations may result in competitors that are better able to compete 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
because we depend upon our management and technical personnel for our success  the loss of key personnel could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our management and technical personnel 
the loss of a number of these key persons could have a negative effect on our operations 
competition is high for such personnel in our industry in all of our locations 
we periodically review our compensation and benefit packages to ensure that they are competitive in the marketplace and make adjustments or implement new programs for that purpose  as appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we require to continue to grow and operate profitably 
our employment costs in the short term are to a large extent fixed  and therefore any unexpected revenue shortfall could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating expense levels are based in significant part on our head count  which generally is driven by longer term revenue goals 
for a variety of reasons  particularly the high cost and disruption of lay offs and the costs of recruiting and training  our head count in the short term is  to a large extent  fixed 
accordingly  we may be unable to reduce employment costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue or gross margin shortfall  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents because our intellectual property is important to our success  the loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights through legal challenge by others or from independent development by others  could adversely affect our business 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  and other measures 
however  we believe that our financial performance will depend more upon the innovation  technological expertise  and marketing abilities of our employees than on such protection 
in connection with our intellectual property rights  we face the following risks our pending patent applications may not be issued or may be issued with more narrow claims  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  rights granted under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  foreign laws may not protect our intellectual property rights  and others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around our patents 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we occasionally receive notices from others alleging infringement claims 
we have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past and one of our subsidiaries  scd mountain view  inc  is involved in such litigation 
we could become involved in similar lawsuits or other patent infringement claims in the future 
we cannot guarantee the outcome of such lawsuits or claims  which may have a significant negative effect on our business or operating results 
we are currently exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 
we currently are  and in the future  may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  contracts and other matters 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend  and could divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
if we are not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  which could require us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result 
sales cycles for some of our products can run as long as to months 
as a result  we may not recognize revenue from efforts to sell particular products for extended periods of time 
we believe that the length of the sales cycle may increase as some current and potential customers centralize purchasing decisions into one decision making entity 
we expect this may intensify the evaluation process and require us to make additional sales and marketing expenditures with no assurance that a sale will result 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business  including rules relating to purchase accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition  in process research and development charges  employee stock purchase plans and stock option grants  have recently been revised or are under review 
changes to those rules or the questioning of our current accounting practices may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business 
in addition  our preparation of 
table of contents financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that it make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact its future operating results 
we do not intend to pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates due to investments in foreign based affiliates 
as of august  our investments in affiliates include a interest in metron technology and a interest in m fsi ltd 
metron technology operates mainly in europe  asia pacific and the united states 
m fsi ltd 
operates in japan 
approximately of fiscal sales to affiliates were to metron technology 
we denominate all us export sales in us dollars 
metron technology attempts to limit its exposure to changing foreign currency exchange rates through operational and financial market actions 
products are sold in a number of countries throughout the world resulting in a diverse portfolio of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
certain short term foreign currency exposures are managed by the purchase of forward contracts to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates as all material outstanding debt was repaid on september  and all marketable securities consist of debt instruments  of which mature within one year 
as of year end  amortized cost approximates market value for all outstanding marketable securities 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
the impact on loss before income taxes of a change in short term interest rates would be approximately  based on cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable security balances as of august  our investment in our affiliate  metron technology  is accounted for by the equity method of accounting and has a carrying value on the balance sheet of approximately million 
the fair value of metron technology is subject to stock market fluctuations 
based on the closing stock price of metron technology of per share on august   the fair value of our investment in metron technology was approximately million  or million less than the carrying value on our balance sheet 
the stock price of metron technology ranged from to per share during fiscal while we determined at august  that our investment in metron technology was not other than temporarily impaired  our decision on october  to use metron technology shares with a value of to settle the termination payment with metron technology triggered an impairment loss on that date for all of the shares we held 
accordingly  the difference between our per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon per the transition agreement on the shares held will be recorded as a non cash impairment charge in our quarter ending november
