item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth the percentage of the patient days from various payors in sunlink s owned or leased hospitals for the periods indicated 
fiscal year three months three months two months ended ended ended ended june  june  june  march  source medicare medicaid private and other sources total the following table sets forth the percentage of the net patient revenues from various payors in sunlink s owned or leased hospitals for the periods indicated 
fiscal year three months three months two months ended ended ended ended june  june  june  march  source medicare medicaid private and other sources total medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
medicaid is a federal state program  administered by the states  that provides hospital and nursing home benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
all of sunlink s hospitals are certified as healthcare services providers for persons covered by medicare and medicaid programs 
amounts received under the medicare and medicaid programs generally are significantly less than the established charges of most hospitals  including our own  for the services provided 
patients generally are not responsible for any difference between established hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurer plans  hmos or ppos  but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has been increasing in recent years 
collection of amounts due from individuals typically is more difficult than from governments or third party payors 
management information systems sunlink utilizes commercially available management information systems at our hospitals  four of which utilize a comprehensive system designed for larger hospitals and two of which utilize a system designed for smaller hospitals 
each system includes features such as a general ledger  patient accounting  billing  accounts receivable  payroll  accounts payable  medical records and materials management 
sunlink maintains a small staff and limited equipment to complement the hospital systems and to report combined and individual data for corporate management  monitoring and compliance purposes 
our goal is to convert all of our hospitals to a single management information system upon expiration of our existing systems agreements  which unexpired terms range from three to five years 
quality assurance each sunlink hospital implements quality assurance procedures to monitor the level and quality of care provided to its patients 
each hospital has a medical director who supervises and is responsible for the quality of medical care provided and a medical advisory committee comprised of physicians who review the professional credentials of physicians applying for medical staff privileges at the hospital 
the medical advisory committee also reviews and monitors surgical outcomes along with procedures performed and the quality of the logistical  medical and technological support provided to the physicians 
each hospital periodically conducts surveys of its patients  either during their stay at the hospital or subsequently by mail  to identify potential areas of improvement 
each sunlink hospital  other than the leased hospital in dexter  missouri  is accredited by jcaho 
regulatory compliance program sunlink maintains a company wide compliance program under the direction of jerome orth  vice president  technical and compliance services 
mr 
orth has over twenty five years experience in reimbursement in multi hospital corporations  at both the facility and corporate level 
sunlink s compliance program is directed at all areas of regulatory compliance  including physician recruitment  reimbursement and cost reporting practices  and laboratory and home healthcare operations 
each hospital designates a compliance officer and develops plans to correct problems should they arise 
in addition  all employees are provided with a copy of and given an introduction to sunlink s code of conduct  which includes ethical and compliance guidelines and instructions about the proper resources to utilize in order to address any concerns that may arise 
each hospital conducts annual training to reemphasize sunlink s code of conduct 
we monitor our corporate compliance program to respond to developments in healthcare regulations and the industry 
sunlink also maintains a toll free hotline to permit employees to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis 
competition among the factors which we believe influence patient selection among hospitals in exurban markets are the appearance and functionality of the healthcare facilities the quality and demeanor of professional staff and physicians  and  the participation of the hospital in plans which pay a portion of the patient s bill 
such factors are influenced heavily by the quality and scope of medical services  strength of referral networks  hospital location  and the price of hospital services 
although our hospitals may face less competition in their immediate patient service areas than would be expected in larger communities  since they are the primary provider of healthcare services in their respective communities  our hospitals nevertheless face competition from larger tertiary care centers and  in some cases  other rural  exurban or  in limited circumstances  urban hospitals 
the competing hospitals may be owned by governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions  and may be able to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis 
such governmental owned and not for profit hospitals  as well as for profit hospitals operating in the service area  likely have greater access to financial resources than do sunlink hospitals 
because of the location of certain of our exurban hospitals in high growth areas  they may  in certain instances  also face competition from large urban hospitals offering more specialized services 
medical staff the number and quality of physicians affiliated with a hospital directly affects the quality and availability of patient care and the reputation of such hospital 
physicians generally may terminate their affiliation with a hospital at any time 
we seek to retain physicians of varied specialties on the medical staffs of our hospitals and to attract other qualified physicians 
sunlink believes physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the quality of services the hospital renders to patients and physicians  the quality of other physicians on the medical staff  the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital s facilities  equipment and employees 
accordingly  sunlink strives to provide quality facilities  equipment  employees  and services for physicians and their patients 
managed care and efforts to control healthcare costs each sunlink hospital is somewhat dependent on its ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services 
health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services through managed care programs and to obtain discounts from hospitals established charges 
in addition  employers and traditional health insurers increasingly are seeking to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group healthcare service purchasers on the basis of market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of medical staff  convenience and price 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market  depending on the market strength of such organizations 
managed care contracts generally are less important in the exurban markets than in urban and suburban markets where there is typically a higher level of managed care penetration 
nevertheless  a significant portion of hospital patients in exurban communities are covered by managed care or other reimbursement programs which pay less than established charges for hospital services 
the healthcare industry  as a whole  faces the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while managing rising costs  facing strong competition for patients  and adjusting to a general reduction of reimbursement rates by both private and government payors 
both private and government payors continually seek to reduce the nature and scope of services which may be reimbursed 
healthcare reform at both the federal and state level generally is designed to reduce reimbursement rates 
changes in medical technology  existing and future legislation  regulations and interpretations  and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payors  may require changes in facilities  equipment  personnel  rates  and or services in the future 
the hospital industry  including all of sunlink s hospitals  continues to have significant unused capacity 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay  and average inpatient occupancy rates continue to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization  utilization review  and payment mechanisms designed to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients and to limit the cost of treating inpatients 
admissions constraints  payor pressures  and increased competition are likely to continue and we expect to continue to respond to such trends by adding and expanding outpatient services  upgrading facilities and equipment  offering new programs  and adding or expanding certain inpatient and ancillary services 
acquisition strategy although our priority is to improve the profitability of our existing hospitals  we monitor the market for community hospitals which are or may be available for purchase 
sunlink faces competition for acquisitions primarily from for profit hospital management companies and not for profit entities which may have greater financial and other resources than does sunlink 
increased competition for the acquisition of non urban acute care hospitals could have an adverse impact on sunlink s ability to acquire such hospitals on favorable terms 
in recent years  the legislatures and attorney generals of several states  including certain states which we believe may have suitable acquisition targets  have shown a heightened level of interest in reviewing transactions involving the sale of not for profit hospitals 
although the level of interest varies from state to state  the trend is to require increased governmental review  and  in some cases  approval of transactions involving a not for profit corporation selling a healthcare facility 
government reimbursement programs medicare medicaid reimbursement a significant portion of sunlink s net revenues is dependent upon reimbursement from medicare and medicaid programs 
the medicare program pays hospitals under the provisions of a prospective payment system for inpatient services 
under the prospective payment system  a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment  known as diagnosis related group drg payments 
drg payments do not consider a specific hospital s costs  but are national rates adjusted for area wage differentials and case mix indices 
long term care psychiatric units within hospitals along with certain other services generally not provided in our facilities currently are exempt from the prospective payment system and are reimbursed under the provisions of a cost based system  subject to specific reimbursement caps 
although the federal government reviews payment rates annually  the percentage increases to drg payment rates for the last several years have been lower than the percentage increases in the related cost of goods and services provided by general hospitals 
the index used to adjust the drg payment rates is based on a price statistic  known as the centers for medicare and medicaid services market basket index  reduced by congressionally mandated reduction factors 
drg rate increases were  
 and for federal fiscal years    and  respectively 
the balanced budget act of set the increase in drg payment rates for future federal fiscal years at rates that are based on the market basket rates less reduction factors of in and in and the medicare  medicaid  and health benefits improvement and protection act of bipa amended the balanced budget act of by giving hospitals a full market basket increase in fiscal and market basket increases minus in fiscal years and in addition  bipa contains provisions delaying scheduled reductions in payment for home health agencies and other provisions designed to lessen the impact on providers of spending reductions contained in the balanced budget act of the medicare program historically has set aside of medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases 
outlier cases are specific cases that exceed published thresholds days or cost for which additional payments outlier payments are received  based on a pre determined formula  over and above the drg rate for that specific case 
during federal fiscal year  medicare projected that payments for outlier cases had exceeded the and  therefore  increased the cost threshold for federal fiscal year  which reduced total payments for outlier cases 
for federal fiscal year  medicare again increased the cost threshold  which will reduce total payments for outlier cases 
for federal fiscal year  medicare has not only increased the cost threshold  thus reducing total payments for outlier cases  but also has changed the rules to apply it after the drg rate plus indirect medical education and disproportionate share payments 
most outpatient services provided by general hospitals are reimbursed by medicare under the outpatient prospective payment system 
the balanced budget act of mandated the implementation of the prospective payment system for medicare outpatient services 
this outpatient prospective payment system is based on a system of ambulatory payment classifications apc 
each apc is designed to represent a bundle of outpatient services  and each apc is assigned a fully prospective reimbursement rate 
bipa also improved the apc rate update factor for calendar year from market basket minus to market basket plus 
for calendar years and  the update factor remains at a market basket of and  respectively 
in addition to the standard drg payment  the social security act requires additional medicare payments be made to hospitals with a disproportionate share of low income patients 
bipa provisions  effective for services provided on and after april   stipulate that rural facilities with fewer than beds with a disproportionate share percentage greater than will be classified as a disproportionate share hospital entitled to receive a supplemental disproportionate share payment based on gross drg payments 
for discharges between april  and september  the disproportionate share payment was  from october  through september  the effective disproportionate share payment will be  and beginning on october  the disproportionate share payment will equal of total drg payments 
all of our hospitals were classified as disproportionate share hospitals at june  medicare disproportionate share payments are estimated to represent approximately of net patient care revenues for the months ended june  and for the months ended june  prior to april   none of our facilities qualified for medicare disproportionate payments under the regulations in effect at that time 
each state operates a medicaid program funded jointly by the state and the federal government 
federal law governs the general management of the medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit local needs and resources 
as a result  each state medicaid plan has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria 
government reimbursement program adjustments the medicare  medicaid and tricare programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to facilities 
all hospitals participating in the medicare and medicaid programs  whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system  are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue  costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to sunlink under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due 
providers also have rights of appeal  and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of prior years cost reports 
although the final outcome of these audits and the nature and amounts of any adjustments are difficult to predict  we believe that we have made adequate provisions in our financial statements for adjustments that may result from these audits and that final resolution of any contested issues should not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
until final adjustment  however  significant issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or greater than ultimately required 
if sunlink or any of our facilities were found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or similar programs  sunlink could be subject to substantial monetary fines  civil penalties and exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
healthcare regulation overview the healthcare industry is one of the largest industries in the united states and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
there are many factors that are highly significant to the healthcare industry including medicare  medicaid  and other public and private hospital cost containment programs  proposals to limit healthcare spending and proposals to limit prices and industry competition factors 
the healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
there continues to be federal and state proposals that would  and actions that do  impose limitations on government and private payments to providers  including community hospitals 
in addition  there regularly are proposals to increase co payments and deductibles from program and private patients 
hospital facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay 
such controls  including what is commonly referred to as utilization review  have resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed 
utilization review entails the review of a patient s admission and course of treatment by a third party 
utilization review by third party peer review organizations is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by medicare and medicaid 
utilization review by third parties also is required under many managed care arrangements 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
various states have applied  or are considering applying  for a waiver from current medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their medicaid participants through managed care providers 
these proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured  and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals  physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under medicaid 
certificate of need requirements a number of states require approval for the purchase  construction  and expansion of healthcare facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
certificates of need con  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services and certain other matters 
all four states in which sunlink currently operates hospitals alabama  georgia  mississippi and missouri have con laws 
the states periodically review  modify and revise their con laws and related regulations 
in addition  future hospital acquisitions may occur in states that require certificates of need 
sunlink is unable to predict whether its hospitals will be able to obtain any certificates of need that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required 
anti kickback and self referral regulations sections of the anti fraud and abuse amendments to the social security act  commonly known as the anti kickback statute  prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under medicaid  medicare or other federal healthcare programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by medicare or other government programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
pursuant to the medicare and medicaid patient and program protection act of  the us department of health and human services hhs issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti kickback statute 
a given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal  however  business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hlpaa  which became effective january   added several new fraud and abuse laws 
these new laws cover all health insurance programs  private as well as governmental 
in addition  hipaa broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws  such as the anti kickback statute  to include not just medicare and medicaid services  but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program 
there is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities  the office of inspector general of the hhs  the courts and the us congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals and opportunities 
investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
enforcement actions have increased  as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities 
in addition  provisions of the social security act  known as the stark act  also prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements 
certain exceptions are available for employment agreements  leases  physician recruitment  and certain other physician arrangements 
a person making a referral  or seeking payment for services referred  in violation of the stark act is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to  for each service  restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims  and or  exclusion from future participation in the medicare program  which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs 
further  if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity  and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity  then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty of up to  many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals  some of which extend beyond the medicaid program  to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws a factor affecting the healthcare industry today is the use of the federal false claims act  usc et 
seq  and  in particular  actions brought by individuals on behalf of the united states under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the false claims act 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the united states alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
violations of the false claims act are punishable by damages equal to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between  and  for each separate false claim 
settlements entered prior to litigation usually involve a less severe damages methodology 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the false claims act defines the term knowingly broadly 
thus  although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the false claims act  submitting a claim with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the false claims act and therefore  will provide grounds for liability 
in some cases  whistleblowers or the federal government have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes  such as the anti kickback statute and the stark act  likewise thereby have submitted false claims under the false claims act 
a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court on behalf of such state governments 
environmental regulations the healthcare operations of sunlink generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
sunlink s operations also are subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations healthcare facility licensing requirements sunlink s healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local legislation and regulations 
in order to maintain their operating licenses  healthcare facilities must comply with strict standards concerning medical care  equipment and hygiene 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
all licenses  provider numbers and other permits or approvals required to perform hospital business operations are held by individual subsidiaries  each of which operates a single hospital 
all of sunlink s hospitals  except the leased hospital in dexter 
missouri  are fully accredited by jcaho 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance sunlink s healthcare facilities are subject to  and comply with  various forms of utilization review 
in addition  under the medicare prospective payment system  each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges in hospitals 
medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised extensively by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility  are overseen by each healthcare facility s local governing board  the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members  and are reviewed by sunlink s quality assurance personnel 
the local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care  develop long range plans  establish  review and enforce practices and procedures  and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
medical records privacy hipaa provided that if congress did not pass comprehensive health privacy legislation by august   the secretary of hhs was required to issue regulations designed to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information no later than february  neither congress nor the secretary of hhs met these deadlines  although hhs eventually did publish final privacy regulations on december  the final regulations became effective in april  and compliance is required by april the regulations apply to medical records created by healthcare providers 
hospitals  health plans and healthcare clearinghouses that are either transmitted or maintained electronically and the paper printouts created from these records  the standards increase consumer control over their medical records  mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient s right to privacy and  with a few exceptions  require that an individual s health information only be used for healthcare related purposes 
the regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations 
on august   hhs published final modifications to the privacy rule 
the final privacy rule contained technical corrections and additional clarifications designed to ensure that protections for patient privacy are implemented in a manner that maximizes privacy while not compromising either the availability or the quality of medical care 
our review of the final privacy rule is not complete at this time and we do not know nor are we able to estimate  with any degree of accuracy  the final cost of compliance with the final privacy standards created by the privacy rule 
our review of the impact of the regulations and resulting standards on our business is being conducted by our vice president  technical and compliance services  who is responsible for developing and implementing our compliance program 
various initiatives are currently underway to address not only the privacy rule  but the security and edi transaction standards provisions of the hipaa regulations as well 
the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry 
on august  hhs published final regulations establishing electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically 
compliance with these regulations is required by october  we cannot accurately predict the impact that these regulations  when fully implemented  will have on our operations 
professional liability as part of our business  we are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of hospital operations 
to cover these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts that we believe are sufficient for our operations  although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect 
in connection with the acquisition of the six community hospitals  sunlink assumed responsibility for general and professional liability claims reported after february  acquisition date  and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims 
we have purchased claims made commercial insurance with a substantial self insured retention for coverage prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for general and professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february   but reported after february  and for claims incurred after february  to the extent of the self insured retention 
as a component of the related liability for general and professional liability risks  we have included the premiums related to the cost of insurance for claims prior to the acquisition date 
discontinued operations and related contingent obligations over the past thirteen years  we have discontinued operations carried on by our former industrial  uk leisure marine  life sciences and engineering and uk child safety segments  as well as the uk housewares segment 
reserves relating to discontinued operations of these segments represent management s best estimate of our possible liability for property  product liability and other claims for which it may incur liability 
these estimates are based on management s judgments using currently available information as well as  in certain instances  consultation with its insurance carriers and legal counsel 
we historically have purchased insurance policies to reduce certain of our product liability exposure and anticipate we will continue to purchase such insurance if available at commercially reasonable rates 
while we have based these estimates on our evaluation of available information  it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of many contingencies relating to discontinued operations 
we intend to adjust our estimates of the reserves as additional information is developed and evaluated 
however  management believes that the final resolution of these contingencies will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
employee and labor relations as of june   sunlink employed full time and part time persons in the us  none of whom are represented by a union 
we believe our labor relations generally are satisfactory 
environmental law compliance we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal  state and local environmental regulations 
to date  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial condition or competitive position 
similarly  we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations

the review sought to determine whether claims were improperly coded for medicare purposes and whether reimbursement claims from such hospitals had been made in violation of one or more applicable laws  including the false claims act  usc et 
seq 
the claims related to periods prior to the time that we acquired these hospitals

except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the foregoing are significant factors we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
however  there could be other additional factors besides those listed herein that also could affect sun link in an adverse manner 
corporate business strategy we have redirected our business strategy toward the operation of community hospitals in the united states and  in february   we acquired for approximately million the six community hospitals and related businesses which we currently operate 
on october   we sold all of the capital stock of what was then our wholly owned united kingdom housewares subsidiary  beldray limited  and we no longer own any operating businesses outside the united states 
in august  to reflect the change in our business focus  we changed our name to sunlink health systems  inc  and changed our fiscal yearend from march to june critical accounting policies and estimates the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as accounting policies critical to us management estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve reserves for adjustments to net patient service revenues  evaluation of the recoverability of assets  including accounts receivable  and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  including income taxes  all as discussed in the following 
net patient service revenues like all operators of community hospitals  we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments at amounts different from established charges 
payment arrangements vary and include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges  and per diem payments 
our patient service revenues are reported as services are rendered at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors  and others 
estimated reductions in revenues to reflect agreements with third party payors and estimated retroactive adjustments under such reimbursement agreements are accrued during the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as interim and final settlements are determined 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to accrue such revenue deductions 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts estimated to become uncollectable in the future 
substantially all receivables are related to providing healthcare services to hospital facility patients 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based generally upon our historical collection experience for each type of payor 
the allowance amount is computed by applying estimated allowance percentages to amounts included in specific payor categories of patient accounts receivable 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to provide the allowance for doubtful accounts 
risk management we are exposed to various risks of loss from medical malpractice and other claims and casualties  theft of  damage to  and destruction of assets  business interruption  errors and omissions  employee injuries and illnesses  natural disasters including earthquakes  and  employee health  dental  and accident benefits 
commercial insurance coverage is purchased for a portion of claims arising from such matters 
when  in our judgment  claims are sufficiently identified  we accrue a liability for estimated costs and losses under such claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries 
in connection with our acquisition of our existing six hospitals  we assumed responsibility for general and professional liability claims reported after february  acquisition date  and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims prior to the acquisition date 
we purchased claims made commercial insurance for acts prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february  but reported after february   and for claims incurred after february  as a component of the related liability for professional liability risks  we have included the premiums related to the estimated cost of insurance for claims incurred  but not reported prior to the acquisition date 
we self insure for workers compensation and employee health risks 
the estimated liability for workers compensation and employee health risks includes estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
we accrue an estimate of losses resulting from workers compensation  employee health and professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
these accruals are estimated quarterly based upon historical loss patterns 
we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation based on our best estimate of a potential loss  if any  or at the minimum end of the range of loss in circumstances where the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we continually revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences 
sfas no 
generally considers all expected future events other than proposed enactments of changes in the income tax law or rates 
we have provided a valuation allowance for all tax assets so that the net tax asset is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that none of the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
currently  the most significant tax asset is a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately  which is subject to internal revenue service code section limitations 
financial summary net revenues months ended year ended june  year ended march  june  community hospitals earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes months ended year ended june  year ended march  june  community hospitals ebitda corporate ebitda depreciation and amortization operating profit loss interest expense interest income earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization 
we understand that industry analysts generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a corporation that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of a corporation and its ability to service debt 
we believe an increase in ebitda level is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
given that ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations 
results of operations continuing operations all of our net revenues relate to the us community hospital segment which was acquired february  as such  net revenues from continuing operations for the twelve months ended june   the three months ended june  and the twelve months ended march  and  respectively  represent only the revenues subsequent that acquisition date 
the operations of sunlink s two other business segments which were operated during that period  uk housewares and child safety products  have been reported in discontinued operations 
our us community hospital segment reported aggregate net revenues of  a total of  adjusted admissions and revenues per adjusted admission of  for the year ended june  community hospital net revenues for the three months ended june  were  with a total of  adjusted admissions and revenues per adjusted admission of  community hospital net revenues for the year ended march  were  with a total of  adjusted admissions and revenues per adjusted admission of  sunlink added new doctors at the six facilities during the year ended june  we seek to increase adjusted admissions by attracting additional physicians to our hospitals  upgrading the services offered by our hospitals  and improving the hospitals physical facilities 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  were  for the year ended june  and  for the three months ended june  the following table shows the relative percentages of operating expenses to net revenues for the twelve and three month periods operating expenses as a of net revenues year ended three months ended june  june  salaries  wages and benefits provision for bad debts supplies purchased services other operating expenses rents and leases expense all expense categories have decreased in the year ended june  compared to the prior three month period except for other operating expenses  which includes the cost of insurance 
insurance costs for all coverage areas increased substantially at the renewal date of february   especially medical malpractice coverage 
sunlink has undertaken cost control initiatives in each facility to reduce labor and other costs 
sunlink s level of bad debts is reflective of its high level of self pay patients 
we provide assistance to the hospitals in implementing additional business office systems and procedures designed to minimize bad debts 
supplies expense was of net revenues for the fiscal year reflecting a lower level and volume of specialty services performed in our hospitals 
management expects supplies expense to increase as additional specialty services are provided by our hospitals

income tax expense of for the year ended march  is composed of for us state taxes and us tax expense 
no us federal nor foreign income taxes are payable for the year ended june  due to tax operating losses for the us and us no deferred income tax expense was recorded because sunlink provided a valuation allowance for us and foreign deferred tax assets 
sunlink decided to provide such valuation allowances and adjust the net deferred tax assets to zero based upon management s assessment that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets items will not be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies considered likely to be available in the future 
for the year ended march   the income tax benefit of is comprised of us tax benefit offset by of foreign tax expense 
sunlink has a net operating loss carryforward in the us of approximately  at june   the future use of which is subject to the limitations of the provisions of internal revenue service code section the liability for general and professional liability risks increased during the year ended june  due to  among other things  an increase in general and professional liability risks retained and increased costs to insure that portion of such risks not retained 
the cost of general and professional liability insurance and all insurance in general has increased substantially during the year due to changes in the insurance market

receivables of our community hospital segment increased due to increased net revenues  offset somewhat by decreased accrued expenses and third parry payor settlements 
cash generated in operating activities in the three months ended june  of  resulted from operating profit of plus non cash depreciation and amortization of and decreased net non cash current assets 
we used cash in operating activities of and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
cash used for the year ended march  resulted principally from payment of corporate expenses  offset somewhat by decreased working capital used by our community hospital segment during the two months after its acquisition 
cash used for the year ended march  resulted principally from payment of corporate expenses 
we used  of cash from investing activities during the year ended june   comprised of  in expenditures for property  plant  and equipment at our hospitals  offset by received from the sale of sunlink s senior preferred stock of lts holdings inc and  received from the sale of the bed nursing home in jasper  georgia and the sale of excess land 
in addition to routine capital expenditures of  during the fiscal year ended june   primarily for new and replacement equipment  we expended  for costs related to the replacement hospital in jasper  georgia and for exterior renovations at chilton medical center in clanton  alabama 
management believes an attractive physical facility assists in recruiting quality staff and physicians as well as attracting patients 
the total committed cost of the new jasper hospital is approximately  of which  had been expended at june  the new hospital currently is being funded by the new term loan and revolving line of credit and cash generated from operations of our community hospital segment 
we used of cash for the three months ended june  for capital expenditures for our community hospital segment which included for renovation and upgrading of patient service areas at chestatee regional hospital in dahlonega  georgia

at june   we had outstanding us long term debt of  of which  was incurred in connection with the february  purchase of the six community hospitals and related businesses   was obtained from the new term loan and related to capital leases 
on january   we closed a  credit facility comprised of a month secured revolving line of credit for up to  with interest at prime plus  and a  secured term loan repayable over months at an interest rate of 
the availability of borrowing under the revolving line of credit is based upon  among other things  a borrowing base keyed to the level of hospital receivables which  based upon our estimates  provides borrowing capacity of approximately  at june  if the amount or quality of receivables is lower than expected  our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit also will be lower 
if we experience a material adverse change in our businesses  assets  financial condition  management  or operations  or the value of the collateral securing the credit facility  we may be unable to draw on the revolving line of credit 
no amount is outstanding on the revolving line of credit at june  we do not expect to draw on the revolving line of credit until the quarter ending december  the net proceeds from the term loan of  are being used for working capital and to fund a portion of our hospital capital projects  which include a replacement hospital in jasper  georgia and a new emergency room at its hospital in ellijay  georgia 
in connection with our purchase of the hospitals in february  the us debt at june  also includes a seller financed balloon note of  and a seller financed zero coupon note of  the balloon note  due january   has a face amount of  and a stated interest rate of which  because it is considered a below market interest rate  has been discounted for financial reporting purposes to a market interest rate of 
the balloon note has a payment in kind pik feature for interest accrued through january  interest due and payable through that date can be paid in additional balloon notes due january   and sunlink presently intends to issue pik notes for interest due through january  additional promissory notes of  for interest from february  through may  have been issued and the interest accrued through june  of has been included in the principal amount of the balloon note at june  the purchase agreement for the six hospitals provides for an adjustment to the balloon note to the extent working capital at the purchase date was greater or less than an agreed upon amount 
we have submitted to the seller a working capital adjustment to reduce the balloon note by  the seller has objected to the adjustment and sunlink and the seller currently are seeking to conclude the working capital adjustment settlement under the dispute provisions of the sale agreement 
no adjustment for any working capital settlement has been made to the balloon note at june  the zero coupon note is due january   has a face amount of  and has been discounted to a market interest rate of 
the principal amount of the zero coupon note is subject to reduction for certain indemnified items pursuant to the purchase agreement 
sunlink has not made any claims for reduction of the zero coupon note 
sunlink disposed of its uk housewares business in october and received no net proceeds from the disposition 
noncurrent liability reserve for discontinued operations at june  includes  relating to the housewares segment which represents a reserve for a portion of a guarantee by one of our uk subsidiaries of beldray s obligations under a lease covering a portion of beldray s manufacturing location 
one of our uk subsidiaries has an option to repurchase the capital stock of beldray for nominal consideration if any of our uk subsidiaries is called upon to perform under the lease guarantee  or under certain other considerations 
management believes sunlink has adequate financing and liquidity in the us to support its current level of operations through the end of the next fiscal year 
the principal current sources of liquidity are the new revolving line of credit  the new term loan facility and cash generated from operations of the community hospital segment 
the availability under the revolving credit facility is based upon a borrowing base keyed to the levels of sunlink s receivables 
this availability of approximately  could be adversely affected by  among other things  decreases in receivables due to lower demand for sunlink s services by patients  change in patient mix and changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services 
cash generated from operations could be adversely affected by  among other things  lower patient demand for sunlink s services  higher operating costs including  but not limited to  salaries  wages and benefits  provisions for bad debts  general liability and other insurance costs  cost of pharmaceutical drugs and other operating expenses  or by changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services and the regulatory environment of the community hospital segment 
from time to time  we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of rural community hospitals 
financing for any such acquisitions could come from additional third party debt  seller financed debt or the proceeds from issuance of additional equity 
currently  we believe our debt capacity is somewhat limited by our debt to equity leverage position 
the debt capacity of one of our subsidiaries  sunlink healthcare corp 
shc  is limited by certain leverage tests in applicable loan agreements 
under the most limiting of such tests  shc would  at june   have been able to incur up to approximately  of additional indebtedness 
our contractual obligations related to long term debt  noncancellable operating leases and physician guarantees at june  were as follows contractual obligations payments due in long term debt operating leases physician guarantees year years years years years more than years sunlink has contracts with eight physicians which contain guaranteed minimum gross receipts 
if the physician s gross patient receipts are less than specific yearly amounts  then the difference is paid by sunlink to the physician 
the contractual obligation is the maximum guarantee that would be owed 
sunlink has commitments for future capital expenditures relating to the new jasper  georgia hospital of approximately  and for a new emergency room at north georgia medical center in ellijay  georgia  of approximately  at june  contingent obligations remain relating to product liability claims for products manufactured and sold before the disposal of sunlink s discontinued industrial segment in fiscal  and for guarantees of certain obligations of former subsidiaries 
we have provided an accrual of  at june  related to a portion of the guarantee by a uk subsidiary of a lease covering a portion of the former housewares segment manufacturing facility 
we currently are in the process of liquidating three dormant subsidiaries in canada  germany and france 
based upon our best estimates  no material amounts are reserved for any contingencies related to these liquidations 
related parties two directors of sunlink are members of two different law firms 
sunlink has paid for legal services to these law firms during the year ended june  inflation during periods of inflation and labor shortages  employee wages increase and suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices for their supplies and services 
we have not always been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing prices for our services and products or by implementing cost control measures 
we are unable to predict our ability to control future cost increases or offset future cost increases by passing along the increased cost to customers 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impacts are discussed at note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at item of this annual report on form i k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sunlink currently is exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of any borrowing under the revolving portion of our credit facility
