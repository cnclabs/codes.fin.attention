item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors  elsewhere in this report or in the information incorporated by reference in this report 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data included in this report  as well as our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on january references contained in this report to a given fiscal year refer to the twelve month period ended january of the succeeding year 
for example  our fiscal year ended january  is referred to in this report as fiscal overview we are a leading provider of integrated consulting and software solutions that enable banks to identify and implement e finance solutions  increase their revenues  reduce their costs and enhance their delivery of customer services 
we were founded in to provide consulting services to banks  and we subsequently integrated software products into our banking solutions 
with our acquisition of check solutions in june  we were able to significantly enhance our portfolio of software products 
the acquisition of check solutions was accounted for as a purchase 
we separate our business operations into three reportable business segments revenue enhancement  global technology solutions and enterprise solutions 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we derive our revenues from consulting fees  software license fees  software maintenance fees  and software implementation fees 
while many customer contracts provide for both the performance of consulting services and the license of related software  some customer contracts require only the performance of consulting services or only a software license and  at the election of the customer  related implementation services and or annual software maintenance services 
we enter into these contracts with our customers on a project by project basis 
we seek to establish long term relationships with our customers that will lead to on going projects utilizing our solutions 
we are typically retained to perform one or more discrete projects for a customer  and we use these opportunities to extend our solutions into additional areas of the customer s operations 
to this end  a significant portion of our current revenues is derived from customers who were customers in prior years  and we are therefore dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with these customers 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   and is based upon data derived from the statements of operations contained in our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following table sets forth this data as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended january  revenues consulting fees software license fees software maintenance fees software implementation fees total revenues cost of revenues consulting fees software license fees write off capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties software maintenance fees software implementation fees total cost of revenues gross profit operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of goodwill and intangible assets merger and restructuring costs total operating costs and expenses income loss from operations other income expense income loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended january  fiscal compared to year ended january  fiscal revenues 
our total revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal after adjusting for the million of revenue attributable to the acquisition of check solutions on june   underlying revenue decreased for fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from a decline in consulting fees in both the revenue enhancement and enterprise solutions business segments 
consulting fees revenues from consulting fees decreased by million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal consulting fees have decreased primarily due to a decrease within the revenue enhancement and enterprise solutions business segments 
the check solutions acquisition had no impact on consulting fees 
revenue enhancement revenues decreased by million or to million for fiscal from million in fiscal due to the lower number of engagements and general economic conditions  we experienced lower revenues from revenue enhancement s value priced engagements 
in an effort to mitigate these factors and to allow customers to more closely match expected benefits from our revenue enhancement services  we began in the quarter ended october  to offer payment terms which extend beyond months 
enterprise solutions consulting fees decreased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal during the fiscal year  economic conditions caused banks to delay the timing of it spending decisions  increasing pricing pressures on these engagements  and slowed mergers or consolidations which also drive revenue for the enterprise solutions segment  resulting in lower overall consulting fees 
software license fees revenues from software license fees increased million or to million from million for fiscal after adjusting for the software license fees attributable to the check solutions acquisition of million for fiscal  our underlying software license fees decreased as compared to fiscal the underlying decrease in software license fees in fiscal is due principally to the decision to discontinue our checkflow product line during the quarter ended july  in light of products available through the acquisition of check solutions 
this decrease was partially offset by software license growth in fraudlink solutions 
software maintenance fees revenues from software maintenance fees increased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal after adjusting for software maintenance fees attributable to the check solutions acquisition of million for fiscal  our underlying software maintenance fees increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal our underlying software maintenance fees have increased as a result of increased software license revenue derived principally from our fraudlink solutions during fiscal  resulting in an increased number of customers and products under maintenance contracts 
maintenance contracts are also normally subject to annual rate increases  usually between and  which are expected to continue in the future 
software implementation fees revenues from software implementation fees increased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal after adjusting for software implementation fees attributable to the check solutions acquisition of million  our underlying software implementation fees were flat for fiscal as compared to fiscal the lack of growth of software implementation fees is due to our product mix 
the majority of the software license growth is in the fraudlink solutions  which generally require less complicated and therefore smaller implementation engagements 
cost of revenues our total cost of revenues have increased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal after adjusting for costs of revenues attributable to the check solutions acquisition of million for fiscal and write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties of million for fiscal  our underlying cost of revenues in fiscal were flat as compared to fiscal the increased costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal is a result of higher personnel costs during periods where corresponding revenues have been flat or declining 
cost of consulting cost of consulting decreased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of consulting as a percentage of consulting fees increased to for fiscal from for fiscal there has been no impact on these costs attributable to the check solutions acquisition 
cost of consulting as a percentage of corresponding revenue has increased due to reductions in revenue levels over comparable periods 
the decrease in the cost of consulting is due to reduced personnel through merger and restructuring efforts  contract labor and travel costs 
cost of software licenses cost of software licenses increased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal costs of software licenses increased principally due to the addition of million of costs from check solutions  offset by underlying decreases in software royalties and software amortization from our existing products 
cost of software licenses as a percentage of license fees decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in cost of software licenses as a percentage of license fees was driven principally by increases in license fee revenue including revenues resulting from the acquisition of check solutions 
in connection with software license and maintenance agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to its customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products  including four back office products and the branch truncation management product 
under these arrangements  we accrue royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
the royalty percentages generally range from to 
approximately  and  of royalty expense was recorded under these agreements in the years ended january  and  respectively 
royalty expense is included as a component of the cost of software license in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
depending on our future product mix  our margins from software license fees may be negatively impacted by increased software royalty expense 
write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties during the second quarter of fiscal  in connection with the company s periodic impairment review of its portfolio of software products  the vault software acquired in the x port business combination in may was deemed to be impaired 
based on our calculation of the expected cash flows of the product  a million non cash charge was recorded 
the charge resulted from the loss of two key transactions and the projected changes in the approach to selling and delivering the software and related services under a time or usage model 
effective march   we entered into an alliance with exchange applications  inc xchange 
as part of this alliance we became the exclusive provider of their enact customer relationship software and methodology to the banking industry 
under the agreement  we became obligated for guaranteed royalty payments of million 
based on our periodic evaluation of the future cash flows associated with this product  a liability for the remaining million obligation was accrued at october   and the carrying value of the prepaid software royalties  at that time  of million was reduced to zero 
this analysis resulted in a charge of million to cost of revenue during the quarter ended october  during december  we negotiated with xchange and received a commitment for  as a partial offset to expenses to be incurred to enhance and support the enact software for the existing customer base 
through january   we reflected  of this reimbursement as a reduction in our cost of revenue 
cost of software maintenance cost of software maintenance increased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal costs of software maintenance as a percentage of software maintenance fees decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal costs of software maintenance increased principally due to the addition of million of costs from check solutions and an underlying increase in personnel costs due to job reassignments attributable to fewer research and development efforts undertaken in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of maintenance fees due to increased revenue levels 
cost of software implementation cost of software implementation increased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of software implementation as a percentage of implementation fees increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the acquisition of check solutions increased the costs of software implementation by million for fiscal the underlying cost of implementations increased primarily due to increased non billable time and travel  which was due to delays in implementation efforts and integration during the third quarter caused by litigation with pegasystems  inc during that quarter 
operating costs and expenses selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses generally consist of personnel costs associated with selling  marketing  general management  software management  provision for doubtful accounts as well as fees for professional services and other related costs 
the acquisition of check solutions increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million during fiscal reflecting the additional costs associated with the check solutions operations 
underlying selling  general and administrative expenses increased by for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in these underlying expenses reflect increased personnel costs  contract labor  travel  office costs and infrastructure costs related to the implementation of the peoplesoft erp system and growth in management staff to support projected revenues 
research and development research and development expenses increased million or to million for the fiscal from million for fiscal research and development expenses were principally generated by check solutions  which accounted for million of these expenses during fiscal these expenses related primarily to our development of the adjustments express back office product  which was generally available in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase from check solutions was offset by a decrease in underlying research and development activity  through reduced personnel costs from employee reductions or job reassignment 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of intangibles was million for fiscal the amortization results from the periodic recognition of amortization expense of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the check solutions acquisition 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles will cease to be amortized effective february  when we adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and no 
see further discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements regarding the adoption of sfas no 
and no 
merger and restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of check solutions during the quarter ended july   we recorded million in merger related costs consisting of million attributable to cost of revenues  million attributable to research and development  and million attributable to selling  general and administrative costs 
in connection with the various legal and administrative actions surrounding the dispute with pegasystems  inc during the quarter ended october   we recorded an additional million of settlement and legal costs and classified them in merger and restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
the payment of these costs will be completed during the year ended january  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented an additional reduction in its workforce to adjust staffing levels to a level sufficient to support projected business activities 
primarily as a result of the reductions  approximately employees were terminated and a charge of million relating primarily to severance costs was recorded during the quarter 
these costs are summarized below in thousands merger and restructuring costs workforce reductions  charges relating to checkflow suite  in process research and development costs  facility closures other quarterly period ended july   pegasystems  inc settlement and legal costs  quarterly period ended october   workforce reductions  facility closures charges relating to checkflow suite quarterly period ended january   total recorded in the year ended january   included in merger and restructuring costs was million of cash termination benefits associated with the separation of approximately employees 
most of the affected employees left their positions during the quarter ended january  we developed the checkflow suite with pegasystems  inc pega under a product development  distribution and sublicensing agreement effective may  the agreement 
pega filed suit to restrain us from developing  marketing  licensing  advertising  leasing or selling any products  including certain back office products acquired during the check solutions business combination  that allegedly compete with products jointly developed under the agreement 
on october  the delaware chancery court granted pega s motion for preliminary injunction 
on november   all matters relating to various legal and administrative actions surrounding this dispute were settled 
under this settlement agreement  we agreed to pay settlement and legal costs totaling million of which million was accrued at july   which includes royalties on prior period sales of the four back office products 
consistent with the prior agreement  we will continue to pay pega royalties based on future sales of the four back office products through october  charges related to the checkflow suite included a write off of capitalized software costs  a write off of accounts receivable net of deferred revenue  settlements and estimated implementation costs for existing checkflow customers  write off of prepaid royalties previously paid to pega  and payments under existing work orders and other product wind down costs 
the implementations provide for estimated time and labor along with out of pockets costs as of january  if actual costs differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated liability would be necessary 
in connection with the check solutions acquisition  a million in process research and development charge was recorded reflecting the estimated fair value of acquired research and development projects at check solutions  which had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the facility closure charge includes  for office space  which will no longer be utilized 
the activity related to the merger and restructuring costs reserve balance during the year ended january  is as follows in thousands charges relating workforce to checkflow facility reductions suite closures other total reserve balance at the beginning of the year merger costs  excluding in process research and development costs    cash paid non cash charges against reserve   other july  reserve balance    merger related costs  pegasystems  inc settlement   cash paid  october  reserve balance    restructuring costs   cash paid   january  reserve balance    interest income interest income decreased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal interest income initially increased during fiscal due to the addition of million of net proceeds related to our public offering of  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  in november as these proceeds as well as approximately million of additional cash  were used to fund the check solutions acquisition during the second quarter  we expect interest income to significantly decrease in the future 
interest expense interest expense is primarily the result of the borrowings during the second quarter under the three year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate  and includes federal  state and foreign income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was lowered to for fiscal due to losses we incurred which were not benefited 
for us to realize the benefit of our net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets recorded as of january   we must generate future taxable income 
due to significant losses incurred in fiscal  we concluded that the more likely than not criteria required for recognition of deferred tax assets under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes was not met at january  thus  a million valuation allowance was recorded in fiscal to fully reserve the net deferred tax assets which resulted in the unbenefitted losses 
for fiscal  our effective income tax rate was 
on march   the federal tax law changed to allow net operating losses for taxable years ending in and to be carried back an additional three years 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the impact of this change in tax law and related five year carryback was not used in the determination of the company s tax provision and related deferred tax valuation allowance for the year ended january  any impact from this change in tax law  including any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the expanded carryback period will first be reflected in our tax provision for the quarterly period ended april  at january   we had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in year ended january  fiscal compared to year ended january  fiscal revenues 
our total revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to growth in revenues from consulting fees 
revenues from consulting fees increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal consulting fees have increased primarily as a result of continued demand for value priced revenue enhancement services and enterprise solutions 
revenue enhancement revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal enterprise solutions increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal value priced engagements have a favorable reception from customers in the united states and in our foreign markets 
revenues related to value priced opportunities tend to fluctuate period to period and are likely to fluctuate in future periods 
software license fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was precipitated by increased demand for our fraudlink and back office solutions 
the fraudlink solution has been particularly successful in both australia and the united kingdom 
software maintenance fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal increases in software maintenance fees have been driven by increased software license revenue along with annual rate increases 
additionally  increases in software maintenance fees have been driven by the acquisition of new software products that were already subject to annual maintenance contracts 
software implementation fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in software implementation fees have been driven by increased software licensing activity resulting in the growth in the number of customers requiring these services 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues generally consists of personnel costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and third party royalties 
total cost of revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the cost of revenue for consulting fees  software license fees and software implementation fees 
cost of revenues for consulting fees increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increases in personnel and personnel related costs to support the growth of the revenue enhancement and enterprise solutions practices 
cost of revenues for software licenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software costs along with increased software royalties expense 
cost of revenues for software implementation increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel cost associated with implementation  training and customer support related to these engagements 
total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased amortization of capitalized software costs and third party royalty expense along with increased personnel costs associated with software implementations 
operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses generally consist of personnel costs associated with selling  marketing  general management and software management  as well as fees for professional services and other related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses primarily reflected the addition of sales  management and administrative staff during fiscal associated with our growth 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses generally consist of personnel and related costs of developing solutions 
in certain instances we have contracted with a third party to develop our solutions 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of non consulting revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal other income 
other income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other income increased as a result of higher earnings on cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting an effective tax rate of and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
increases in the estimated annual effective rate resulted from increased state taxes and also increased non deductibility of certain expenses 
selected consolidated quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly data for each of our last eight quarters ended january  the data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in management s opinion  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of this information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance

our quarterly results may vary significantly depending primarily on factors  such as the extent and timing of revenues recognized  particularly in light of our historical tendency to have a disproportionately large portion of our contract signings near the end of each quarter  increases in costs beyond anticipated levels  especially in the context of costs incurred under value pricing contracts  the degree of customer acceptance of new solutions  the introduction of new or enhanced solutions by us or our competitors  our mix of revenues derived from consulting and management service fees on the one hand  and software related fees on the other  customer budget cycles and priorities and purchasing cycles  competitive conditions in the industry  seasonal factors  timing of consolidation decisions by customers  the extent of customers international expansion  and general economic conditions 
because of the above factors  along with such non recurring items such as merger and restructuring costs and write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties  the results of any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for the full year 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience growth in revenues and earnings 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and cash expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
at january   we had a working capital of million compared to million at january  we had million in cash and cash equivalents at january   a decrease of million from million in cash and cash equivalents at january  at january   we had million of long term debt 
based on our cash forecasts  we expect to use cash from an equity offering discussed below and cash from operating activities to fund our operations in fiscal cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating cash flows decreased in fiscal primarily due to our net loss for fiscal  increases in accounts receivable  prepayments of software royalties and decreases in deferred revenues 
average days sales outstanding fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including the timing of billings specified by contractual agreement  and receivables for expense reimbursements 
the following table contains the quarterly days sales outstanding dso with a comparative column which adds reimbursed expenses to the revenue portion of the computation 
reimbursed expenses are travel and out of pocket expenses  which are not considered revenue but are included in outstanding receivables 
quarter ended dso dso including expense reimbursements january  october  july  april  january  cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the acquisition of check solutions company 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the purchase of two companies  automated integrated solutions  inc and x port software  inc  along with purchases of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  and was related to purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of computer software costs 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from million drawn on our revolving credit agreement entered into to assist in funding the check solutions acquisition 
the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal related to our public offering of  shares of common stock on november  which raised million after deducting the costs of the offering 
on june   we entered into a three year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks in an amount not to exceed million 
at january   we had borrowed million to fund the acquisition of check solutions 
all outstanding borrowings are due on june  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest equal to either the greater of prime or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from to depending on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda  or london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin equal to to depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
interest payments are due quarterly 
we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to to depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda on the unused amount of the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified interest coverage  ratio of ebitda to funded debt  and ratio of accounts receivable  cash and short term investments to funded debt 
additionally  the payment of dividends is precluded subject to the approval of the banks 
effective october   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to reflect the impact of the decline in recent operating results 
under the amendment  margin rates were increased on prime or federal funds based loans to  and on libor based loans to 
effective august   margins will decrease to a range of to on prime or federal funds based loans  and to a range of to on libor based loans 
substantially all of our assets collateralize this revolving credit agreement 
also under the amendment  certain covenants were adjusted to levels we expect to achieve 
as of january   we are in compliance with the covenants of the revolving credit agreement  as amended 
while there can be no assurance  we believe we will continue to meet these covenants during the year ended january  any instances of non compliance would negatively impact our liquidity 
our ability to make additional borrowings under this revolving credit agreement is limited by a formula based on our outstanding accounts receivable 
additionally  if our accounts receivable decreases below certain levels as defined in the revolving credit agreement  mandatory prepayments of the debt may be required 
at january   million of additional borrowing capacity was available to us under the formula 
at january   we had material commitments for our operating leases  as described in note in our notes to consolidated financial statements  including commitments of approximately million in fiscal we have no material commitments for our capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be similar or slightly less than levels experienced in fiscal we may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that could complement or expand our business and product offerings 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease in our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
on april   we sold  shares to a group of investors in a private transaction 
in connection with this transaction  we intend to file a registration statement on form s  following the filing of this annual report on form k for the year ended january   seeking to register the resale of such shares 
we utilized the approximately million of net proceeds that were received from the sale to satisfy existing obligations due to certain former employees of check solutions  with the remainder being used for working capital 
such amounts were paid on april  see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current cash balances and expected future cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities during fiscal however  if current sources are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the failure to secure additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january  and the effect these contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total year or less years after years revolving credit agreement   operating leases     accrued merger and restructuring costs   borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are subject to repayment based on our outstanding accounts receivable levels  as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and our estimates may vary from actual results 
we consider the following four accounting policies as the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ  and such differences could be significant to our financial results 
revenue recognition consulting fees 
we employ three primary pricing methods in connection with our delivery of consulting services 
first  we may price our delivery of consulting services on the basis of time and materials  in which case the customer is charged agreed upon daily rates for services performed and out of pocket expenses 
in this case  we are paid fees and related amounts on a monthly basis  and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
second  we may deliver consulting services on a fixed price basis 
in this case  we are paid on a monthly basis or pursuant to an agreed upon payment schedule  and we recognize revenues paid on a percentage of completion basis 
we believe that this method is appropriate because of our ability to determine performance milestones and determine dependable estimates of our costs applicable to each phase of a contract 
since financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses 
anticipated losses on fixed priced contracts are recognized when estimable 
third  we may deliver consulting services pursuant to a value priced contract with the customer 
in this case  we are paid  on an agreed upon basis with the customer  either a specified percentage of the projected increased revenues and or decreased costs that are expected to be derived by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution or the actual increased revenues and or decreased costs experienced by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution  subject in either case to a maximum  if any is agreed to  on the total amount of payments to be made to us 
these contracts typically provide for us to receive a percentage of the projected or actual increased revenues and or decreased costs  with payments to be made to us pursuant to an agreed upon schedule ranging from one to twelve months in length 
we recognize revenues generated from consulting services in connection with value priced contracts based upon projected results only upon completion of all services and agreement upon the actual fee to be paid even though billings for these services may be delayed by mutual agreement for periods not to exceed twelve months 
in an effort to allow customers to more closely match expected benefits from our services with payments to us  during the third quarter of fiscal  we began to offer payment terms which extend beyond months 
when we enter into an agreement which has a significant component of the total amount payable under the agreement due beyond months and it is determined payments are not fixed and determinable at the date the agreement was entered into  revenue under the arrangement will be recognized as payments become due and payable 
under this approach  upon contract signing  a completed backlog of revenue is established which is incrementally recognized as revenue over future quarters as amounts become due and payable under the agreement 
when fees are to be paid based on a percentage of actual revenues and or savings to our customers  we recognize revenues only upon completion of all services and as the amounts of actual revenues or savings are confirmed by the customer 
we typically must first commit time and resources to develop projections associated with value pricing contracts before a bank will commit to purchase our solutions  and we therefore assume the risk of making these commitments with no assurance that the bank will purchase the solutions 
we expect that value pricing contracts will continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the future 
as a consequence of the use of value pricing contracts and due to the revenue recognition policy associated with those contracts  our results of operations will likely fluctuate significantly from period to period 
regardless of the pricing method employed by us in a given contract  we are typically reimbursed on a monthly basis for out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of our customers 
expenses are netted against reimbursements for consolidated financial statement reporting purposes  for fiscal  and beginning february   we will begin to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the statement of operations in accordance with a recent fasb announcement 
see recently issued accounting standards 
software license fees 
in the event that a software license is sold either together with consulting services or on a stand alone basis  we are usually paid software license fees in one or more installments  as provided in the customer s contract but not to exceed twelve months 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition 
under sop  we recognize software license revenues upon execution of a contract and delivery of software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required  and collection is considered probable by management 
although substantially all of our current software licenses provide for a fixed price license fee  some licenses instead provide for the customer to pay a monthly license fee based on actual use of the software product 
the level of license fees earned by us under these arrangements will vary based on the actual amount of use by the customer 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized on a monthly basis 
in connection with software license and maintenance agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to its customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products  including four back office products and branch truncation management product 
under these arrangements  we accrue royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
the royalty percentages generally range from 
royalty expense is included as a component of the cost of software licenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
software maintenance fees 
in connection with our sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software maintenance services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software maintenance services  which typically are renewed annually 
we charge an annual maintenance fee  which is typically a percentage of the initial software license fee 
the annual maintenance fee generally is paid to us at the beginning of the maintenance period  and we recognize these revenues ratably over the term of the related contract 
software implementation fees 
in connection with our sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software implementation services  including software enhancements  patches and other software support services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software implementation services 
we price our implementation services on a time and materials or on a fixed price basis  and we recognize the related revenues as services are performed as these services are not essential to the functionality of the associated software 
revenues for agreements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date are recognized based on the relative fair value of those elements determined using vendor specific objective evidence 
if fair values have not been established for certain undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their fair values have been determined 
our contracts do not include right of return clauses 
as a result  we have experienced few returns or cancellations for our products  and accordingly we do not record a provision for returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts a large proportion of our revenues and receivables are attributable to our customers in the banking industry 
our trade accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of receivables 
to evaluate a specific customer s ability to pay  we analyze financial statements  payment history  and various information or disclosures by the customer or other publicly available information 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us or if the collection of the receivable becomes doubtful due to a dispute that arises subsequent to the delivery of our products and services  we set up a specific reserve in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
most of our contracts include multiple payment milestones  some of which occur in advance of revenue recognition  which mitigates our risk both in terms of collectibility and adjustments to recorded revenue 
software costs capitalized  goodwill and other intangible assets software costs capitalized include developed technology acquired in acquisitions and costs incurred by us in developing our products which qualify for capitalization 
we capitalize our development costs of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
our policy is to capitalize software development costs incurred in developing a product once technological feasibility of the product has been established 
software development costs capitalized also include amounts paid for purchased software on products that have reached technological feasibility 
technological feasibility of the product is determined after completion of a detailed program design and a determination has been made that any uncertainties related to high risk development issues have been resolved 
if the process of developing the product does not include a detailed program design  technological feasibility is determined only after completion of a working model which has been beta tested 
all software development costs capitalized are amortized using an amount determined as the greater of i the ratio that current gross revenues for a capitalized software project bears to the total of current and future projected gross revenues for that project or ii the straight line method over the remaining economic life of the product generally three to six years 
through january   goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized using the straight line method over lives of six to fifteen years 
effective february   goodwill will no longer be amortized 
see recently issued accounting standards below 
the goodwill will be assessed on an annual basis for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of other long lived assets warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that other long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows over the remaining life of the asset to determine if impairment has occurred 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent from other asset groups 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is assessed when the undiscounted  expected future operating cash flows derived from the asset are less than its carrying value 
management believes that assumptions used to determine cash flows are reasonable  but actual future cash flows may differ from those estimated 
if we determine an asset has been impaired  the impairment is recorded based on the estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
merger and restructuring during fiscal year  we recorded significant reserves in connection with our acquisition of check solutions and subsequent operational restructurings 
these reserves contain significant estimates pertaining to work force reductions  and the settlement of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with statement no 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of the statement no 
is expected to result in an increase in net income of million per share using the dilutive number of shares at january  per year 
during  we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of february  and have not yet determined what the effect of these will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 which replaces sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
sfas no 
also broadens disposal transaction reporting related to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that a charge  if any  related to the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal will be significant 
in november  the fasb issued a staff announcement topic d covering the income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred announcement 
the announcement requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the statement of operations 
we netted reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses against the related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the announcement is to be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  and comparative financial statements for prior periods are to be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
we will adopt the announcement beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the announcement is not expected to have a significant impact on gross margin and will have no effect on net income  but will increase consulting fees and software implementation fees and related costs of revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and maintained with nationally recognized financial institutions  and mutual fund companies 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
we treat all of our cash equivalents and short term investments as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading 
all investments were liquidated as of january  the weighted average interest rate on investment securities at january  was 
amortized cost of short term investments held at january  was million  which approximates fair value 
we currently have million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at january  as described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  the interest rate is variable 
at january   the interest rate on million of the debt is and the interest rate on million of the debt is 
foreign currency risk less than of our accounts receivable balance at january  and was denominated in a foreign currency 
our exposure to adverse movements to foreign exchange rates is not significant 
therefore  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure 
historically  foreign currency gains and losses have not had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we will continue to evaluate the need to adopt a hedge strategy in the future and may implement a formal strategy if the volume of our business transacted in foreign currencies increases
