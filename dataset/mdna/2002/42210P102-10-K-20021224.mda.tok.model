item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
headwaters fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  all future references to years shall mean headwaters fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
acquisitions of isg and hti the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters and all of its subsidiaries  only two of which have significant operations  isg and hti 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  isg was acquired on september  and hti was acquired in august accordingly  isg s results of operations for the period from september  through september  have been consolidated with headwaters results and isg s balance sheet has been consolidated with headwaters balance sheet as of september  due to the time required to obtain accurate financial information related to hti s foreign contracts  for financial reporting purposes hti s financial statements are consolidated with headwaters financial statements using a one month lag 
accordingly  hti s august acquisition date balance sheet was consolidated with headwaters september  balance sheet  but no results of operations of hti were included in the consolidated statement of income for hti s august  balance sheet was consolidated with headwaters september  balance sheet and hti s results of operations for the year ended august  were consolidated with headwaters results 
isg acquisition 
on september   headwaters acquired of the common stock of isg  assumed or paid off all of isg s outstanding debt and redeemed all of isg s outstanding preferred stock 
isg is headquartered in salt lake city  utah and is engaged primarily in the management of long term contracts for coal combustion products and the distribution of related building materials and construction products throughout the united states  all through its wholly owned subsidiary  isg resources  inc headwaters has focused on using technology to add value to fossil fuels  particularly coal 
the acquisition of isg provides headwaters with a significant position in the last step of the coal value chain due to its competencies in managing the products resulting from the combustion of coal 
the acquisition of isg also brings to headwaters substantial management depth  comprehensive corporate infrastructure and critical mass in revenues and operating profit 
in order to obtain the cash necessary to acquire isg and retire isg s outstanding debt  headwaters issued million of new debt consisting of million of senior secured debt with a five year term and a variable interest rate and million of subordinated debt with an approximate five year term and a fixed interest rate see note to the consolidated financial statements 
isg management participated in one half  or million  of the subordinated debt 
total cash proceeds from the issuance of new debt  net of debt discounts  was million 
headwaters incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs to place the new debt  which had an initial combined effective weighted average interest rate of approximately 
total consideration paid for isg was approximately million  which consisted of the issuance of headwaters common stock  cash payments to the former isg stockholders  cash paid to retire isg debt  and costs directly related to the acquisition 
the isg acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  business combinations 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of september  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets consisting primarily of contracts with coal fired power generation plants 
this amount is being amortized over the estimated combined useful life of years 
the remaining purchase price not attributable to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets approximating million was allocated to goodwill 
the final allocation of the purchase price  in particular the estimated fair values for certain acquired property  will likely differ from the preliminary allocation after final valuations and other procedures have been completed 
hti acquisition 
in august  headwaters completed the acquisition of of the common stock of hti  a new jersey based company 
hti develops and commercializes catalysts and catalytic processes for producing chemicals and converting low value fossil fuels into high value alternative fuels 
total consideration at closing  including the direct costs incurred by headwaters to consummate the acquisition  was approximately million 
in accordance with the original hti acquisition agreements  additional contingent consideration could be earned by the former hti stockholders during calendar based on the attainment of certain operating targets and other milestones 
in april  headwaters and the former hti stockholders agreed to an amendment of the acquisition agreements and reached a final settlement of all outstanding contingent payments 
headwaters paid the former hti stockholders additional consideration with a value totaling approximately million 
total consideration paid for hti was therefore approximately million  which consisted of the issuance of headwaters common stock and options to acquire headwaters common stock  cash payments to the former hti stockholders  cash paid to retire hti debt  and costs directly related to the acquisition 
the hti acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets consisting of existing patented technology with an estimated useful life of years 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  consisting primarily of efforts focused on developing catalysts and catalytic processes to lower the cost of producing alternative fuels and chemicals while improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental risks 
this amount represented the estimated purchased in process technology for projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use as of the acquisition date  and was expensed in approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
segments 
until headwaters acquired isg in september  headwaters operated in and reported as a single industry segment  alternative energy 
with the acquisition of isg in september  headwaters now operates in three business segments  alternative energy  ccps  and manufactured products 
these segments are managed and evaluated separately by management based on fundamental differences in their operations  products and services 
the alternative energy segment includes headwaters traditional coal based solid alternative fuel business and hti s business of developing and commercializing catalysts and catalytic processes for producing chemicals and converting low value fossil fuels into high value alternative fuels 
revenues for this segment include primarily sales of chemical reagents and license fees 
the ccp segment includes isg s business of supplying post combustion services and technologies to the coal fired electric utility industry 
this segment markets and manages coal combustion products such as fly ash and bottom ash  known as ccps 
isg has long term contracts  primarily with coal fired electric generating utilities  pursuant to which it manages the post combustion operations for the utilities 
isg markets these ccps to replace manufactured or mined materials  such as portland cement  lime  agricultural gypsum  fired lightweight aggregate  granite aggregate and limestone 
ccp revenues consist primarily of the sale of products  along with a small percentage of service revenue 
the manufactured products segment produces and sells standard masonry and stucco construction materials and supplies  packaged products and blocks  as well as some of isg s value added technology products 
isg has introduced high volumes of ccps as ingredients in the mortars  stuccos and blocks that the manufactured products segment produces 
critical accounting policies and estimates headwaters significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
headwaters continually evaluates its policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of headwaters accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of these critical accounting policies and estimates 
license fee revenue recognition 
there are alternative fuel facilities that are currently licensed to use headwaters patented technology and from which headwaters earns license fees 
these recurring license fees or royalty payments are recognized in the period when earned  which generally coincides with the sale of alternative fuel by headwaters licensees 
in certain instances  headwaters receives timely regular written reports from licensees notifying headwaters of the amount of solid alternative fuel sold and the royalty due headwaters under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
moreover  in most instances  headwaters has experienced a regular pattern of payment by the licensees of these reported amounts due 
generally  estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  can be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees for whom an established pattern exists 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee is beginning to produce and sell alternative fuel or when an alternative fuel facility is sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there is no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may be more limited information upon which to determine an estimate of license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  headwaters uses such information as is available and where possible  attempts are made to substantiate the information  such as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by the licensee and used in the production of the solid alternative fuel 
in certain limited situations  headwaters is unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and therefore revenue recognition is delayed until a future date when sufficient information is known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
realizability of receivables 
allowances are provided for uncollectible accounts and notes receivable when deemed necessary 
such allowances are based on an account by account analysis of collectibility or impairment and totaled approximately at september  and approximately million at september  for trade receivables and at september  and for notes receivable 
headwaters performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers  but collateral is not required for trade receivables 
collateral  generally consisting of most or all assets of the debtor  is required for notes receivable 
with regard to headwaters trade receivables from the alternative energy segment  past allowances have been minimal as have any required write offs 
trade receivables from the ccp and manufactured products segments involve substantially more customers and receivable allowances are required 
headwaters reviews the collectibility of its trade receivables as of the end of each reporting period 
losses recognized on notes receivable were in  approximately million in and approximately million in because the notes generally relate to nonoperating activities  these losses are included in other expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the losses on receivables in consisted entirely of write offs or impairments of notes receivable from unrelated high risk entities which headwaters loaned funds to in late fiscal and early fiscal  which amounts were determined to be uncollectible or worthless 
headwaters no longer makes these loans  and in september  headwaters sold all its remaining loans and equity investments in these entities to a limited liability corporation  in exchange for a  note receivable  due no later than september this note is being accounted for on the cost recovery basis 
headwaters reviews collectibility of this note receivable at the end of each reporting period 
this collectibility review consists of consideration of payments of required interest and principal and the sufficiency of the collateral to support the outstanding note receivable balance 
to the extent impairment is indicated  headwaters writes down the note receivable to its estimated net realizable value at that time 
an impairment loss of approximately million was recorded in due to a decline in the value of the underlying collateral 
headwaters considers its receivable allowances adequate as of september   however  changes in economic conditions generally or in specific markets in which headwaters operates could have a material effect on required reserve balances 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
headwaters periodically evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to headwaters business model or changes in headwaters capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from headwaters current estimates 
in those cases where headwaters determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be shortened  headwaters would amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation or amortization expense 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
impairment related losses recognized in headwaters consolidated statement of income for are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there were no losses recorded in or indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
beginning in  headwaters will perform periodic impairment tests of its intangible assets  most of which were acquired in connection with the acquisitions of isg and hti  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets 
the new rules require  among other things  that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit giving rise to the goodwill 
headwaters currently believes that neither the isg nor hti related identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are impaired under either the existing rules for testing impairment  or under the new rules required by sfas no 
identified intangible assets consist primarily of isg long term contracts and hti patented technology 
it is possible that some of headwaters tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that the resulting write downs could be material 
legal matters 
headwaters is involved in several legal proceedings that have arisen out of the normal course of business  all as explained in more detail in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
of the five primary legal matters described in note  headwaters is a defendant in three cases  and both a plaintiff and defendant in two cases 
management in all cases intends to vigorously defend its position 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these activities will have a significant effect upon the operations or the financial position of headwaters  however  it is possible that a change in management s estimates of probable liability could occur and the change could be significant 
in regards to all of these legal matters  legal counsel cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amounts of recovery or liability 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for fiscal with its operating results for fiscal revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to million as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
chemical reagent sales 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales in over was due to increased alternative fuel production by headwaters licensees  as well as sales of chemical reagents to new customers 
currently  headwaters expects its future chemical reagent sales revenue from all licensees and other customers to be higher than the amounts reported for due to anticipated increases in alternative fuel production by licensees and increased sales of chemical reagents to new customers 
however  headwaters does not expect the rate of growth in to be as high as it was for license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or over million of license fee revenue recognized during license fees in consisted of recurring license fees or royalty payments of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
license fees in consisted of recurring license fees of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
a major licensee significantly reduced its production and sale of alternative fuel in early and did not operate its four facilities for most of this licensee sold the facilities in october  and headwaters earned approximately million more in license fees from these facilities in than in this factor  combined with increased alternative fuel sales by most other licensees  caused the increase in license fee revenue for over headwaters currently expects license fee revenue to increase in by an amount comparable to the increase 
however  these increases are expected to decline in the future as this business segment continues to mature and it is possible that unforeseen adverse events could occur in the future that would cause license fee revenue to decrease 
pursuant to the contractual terms of an agreement with a certain licensee  the cumulative net license fees generated by headwaters  totaling approximately million as of september   have been placed in escrow for the benefit of headwaters 
headwaters currently expects the escrowed amounts to increase as additional license fees are generated and that most  if not all  of such amounts will be recognized as revenue at some future date 
certain accounting rules governing revenue recognition require that the seller s price to the buyer be fixed or determinable as well as reasonably certain of collection 
in this situation  those rules appear to currently preclude revenue recognition 
accordingly  none of the escrowed amounts have been recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
other revenues and cost of revenues 
coal combustion product sales and services and manufactured product sales and the related cost of revenue captions represent isg s revenues and cost of revenues for the period from september  through september  approximately million of other revenues and million of cost of other revenues represent hti s revenues and cost of revenues for there were no comparable revenues and cost of revenues for isg and hti in depreciation and amortization 
these costs increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation and amortization of the tangible and intangible assets acquired in the hti acquisition in august million and the depreciation and amortization of the tangible and intangible assets acquired in the isg acquisition in september million 
depreciation and amortization expense will increase substantially in as a result of the isg acquisition 
research and development 
approximately million of the hti purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  all of which was expensed in in  research and development expenses of million represent primarily million of costs related to hti activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million or to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to isg costs of approximately million  an increase in compensation related costs of approximately million  an increase in professional services expenses of approximately million and smaller increases in most of the other expense categories 
the increase in compensation related costs related primarily to an increase in incentive based pay as a result of improved operating results 
the increase in professional services expenses was due primarily to legal costs associated with legal actions headwaters is currently pursuing 
the increases in other expense categories were due primarily to the growth of headwaters business during other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expenses of million compared to net other expenses of million during the change of million or is primarily attributable to i an increase in interest and net investment income of million  ii a decrease in equity and debt investment related losses of approximately million  and iii a gain on the sale of assets of approximately million  partially offset by the write off of deferred project financing costs of approximately million and an increase in interest expense of approximately million 
the increase in interest income from to primarily related to an increase in the average balance of short term investments in over  partially offset by a decrease in interest income from a million note receivable from a licensee which was collected in october during  headwaters made several equity investments in and loans to unrelated high risk entities and in  headwaters recorded losses totaling approximately million related to write offs of these investments and loans 
in september  headwaters sold all of its remaining high risk investments in exchange for a million note receivable from a limited liability corporation 
headwaters wrote down this note receivable as of september  and recorded an impairment loss of approximately million in due to a decline in the value of the underlying collateral 
the million gain on sale of assets resulted from the sale of a interest in one of headwaters original alternative fuel facilities 
headwaters recorded approximately million of losses related to the write off of deferred project financing costs in resulting from the abandonment of certain projects or the postponement or redirection of activities for which costs had previously been deferred pending the ultimate outcome of the projects and activities 
interest expense increased in due to the substantial increase in outstanding debt incurred in september to finance the acquisition of isg 
interest expense will increase substantially in as a result of the debt incurred to facilitate the isg acquisition 
income taxes 
in  headwaters reported a net income tax benefit of  consisting of the recognition of  of its deferred tax asset  reduced by  of federal alternative minimum tax and  of current state income tax expense 
in  as a result of recording the full value of its deferred tax asset in  headwaters recorded an income tax provision with an effective tax rate of approximately 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for fiscal with its operating results for fiscal revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to million as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
chemical reagent sales 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales in over was due to increased alternative fuel production by headwaters licensees  as well as sales of chemical reagents to new customers 
there were no similar sales of chemical reagents to new customers in license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or over million of license fee revenue recognized during license fees in consisted of recurring license fees or royalty payments of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
license fees in consisted of recurring license fees of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
recurring license fees in included million related to a single licensee that owned four facilities 
this licensee did not report and pay certain prior period royalty obligations to headwaters timely  resulting in some catch up revenue recognition in for royalties related to periods other than the year ended september  moreover  this licensee significantly reduced its production and sale of alternative fuel in early and did not operate the four facilities for most of these two factors combined resulted in a decline in recurring license fees from the licensee of approximately million in as compared to due to increased alternative fuel sales  there was an increase of approximately million in recurring license fees from all other licensees in over in  the largest single licensee accounted for million of earned license fees 
depreciation and amortization 
these costs decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to elimination of depreciation associated with the three facilities owned by headwaters which were sold in research and development 
approximately million of the hti purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  all of which was expensed in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million or to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to an increase in professional services expenses of approximately million and an increase in compensation related costs of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by the elimination of approximately million of costs associated with the facilities owned by headwaters which were sold in and the wash plant located in utah  as well as the resolution in of certain liabilities for million less than previously recorded 
the increase in professional services expenses was due primarily to legal costs associated with legal actions headwaters is pursuing 
the increase in compensation related costs related primarily to an increase in marketing department headcount 
asset write offs and other charges 
in  headwaters recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to assets located in utah and alabama 
this impairment charge consisted of an approximate million write down to net realizable value of certain ancillary plant equipment which remained on the sites when the facilities were sold and was idled  plus an approximate million write off of an intangible asset which was no longer considered recoverable due to the relocation of a licensee facility 
headwaters also recorded employee severance and other non cash charges from incremental amortization of deferred compensation from stock options resulting from the termination of employees whose stock options became fully vested upon termination totaling approximately million 
other settlement charges million and asset write downs million were recorded in all of these asset write offs and other charges totaled approximately million 
there were no similar charges recorded in other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expenses of million compared to net other income of million during the change of million or is primarily attributable to i a decrease in gains on sale of facilities of million  ii a decrease in interest and investment income of approximately million  iii an increase in equity and debt investment related losses of approximately million  and iv a decrease of million from gains on other transactions  related to the satisfaction of a million contingent contract liability and a million gain recognized on a note receivable transaction in these changes were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in interest expense and an increase in the mark to market adjustment of the carrying value of a related party note receivable of approximately million 
in  headwaters sold a facility located in pennsylvania on which a loss of approximately million was recognized 
headwaters also entered into an agreement under which it operates this facility on behalf of the owner 
in  upon achieving specified operating performance milestones  headwaters received additional cash payments related to the sale of this facility 
these payments  net of obligations to third parties  approximated million 
of the net amount received  headwaters recognized million as a gain in because there were no ongoing obligations associated with those payments 
headwaters deferred the recognition of million  which amount was characterized in the sales agreement as prepaid royalties 
this amount is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis through december in  headwaters sold the three remaining alternative fuel facilities it owned plus an option to acquire a licensee facility 
one of these sold facilities was located in utah  two of these facilities were located in west virginia  and the facility under option was located in nevada 
headwaters reported net gains on these transactions totaling approximately million 
headwaters also entered into its standard supply agreements with the new owners of the facilities to sell proprietary chemical material used at the facilities and receives ongoing royalties based upon the sale of alternative fuel from the facilities 
the decrease in interest income from to primarily related to a decrease in interest from the related party note receivable discussed below from million in to in and a decrease in the interest rate on a million note receivable from a licensee 
during  headwaters made several equity investments in and loans to unrelated high risk entities and in  headwaters recognized approximately million of losses related to its equity investments 
during  headwaters recorded additional losses totaling approximately million related to write offs of notes receivable and losses on equity investments  for an increase of million in the losses compared to interest expense decreased in primarily due to the significantly lower average levels of outstanding borrowings that existed in as compared to during  headwaters sold certain construction companies and received as consideration a million note receivable 
the note was marked to market each period based upon the market value of headwaters common stock held as collateral and was reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at the underlying value of this collateral  million at september  in  headwaters accepted as full satisfaction of the note receivable the shares of headwaters stock collateralizing the note and a new note receivable which was recorded at due to substantial uncertainty of both the collectibility of the new note and the value of the new collateral 
this transaction resulted in recognition of a gain in of approximately million  representing the increase in value of the collateral from september  to the date the collateral was surrendered in payment of the note 
the corresponding adjustment in resulted in a write up of million for a net increase in the adjustment of million in compared to income taxes 
in  headwaters reported a net income tax benefit of million  consisting of the recognition of million of its deferred tax asset  reduced by million of federal alternative minimum tax 
in  headwaters reported a net income tax benefit of million  consisting of the recognition of million of its deferred tax asset  reduced by million of federal alternative minimum tax and million of current state income tax expense 
headwaters valuation allowance decreased by million during a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based primarily on results of operations in and expected future results of operations  headwaters determined that as of september   it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would be realized and the valuation allowance was eliminated 
extraordinary item 
in  headwaters redeemed all of its remaining convertible debt 
the redemption consideration and early prepayment costs included approximately million in cash plus the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
the loss recognized as a result of the total redemption consideration paid plus the acceleration of amortization of the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs in excess of the debt carrying value totaled approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during was million compared to million during most of the cash flow from operating activities in both periods was attributable to net income 
during  investing activities consisted primarily of payments for the acquisition of isg 
financing activities in consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt used to finance the acquisition of isg 
operating activities 
headwaters reported net income for of million 
moreover  most of headwaters reported income tax expense of million consisted of deferred income taxes  largely as a result of using headwaters net operating loss carryforwards which did not require the use of cash 
for  cash provided from operations was reduced by a significant increase in trade receivables approximating million  net of isg s trade receivables as of the date of acquisition 
this increase in trade receivables is due to the significant increase in revenues 
investing and financing activities 
headwaters acquired isg in september payments to acquire isg  net of cash acquired  were approximately million 
in order to obtain the cash necessary to acquire isg and retire the isg debt  headwaters issued million of new debt consisting of million of senior secured debt with a five year term and a variable interest rate and million of subordinated debt with an approximate five year term and a fixed interest rate see note to the consolidated financial statements 
total cash proceeds from the issuance of new debt  net of debt discounts  was million 
headwaters incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs to place the new debt  which had an initial combined effective weighted average interest rate of approximately 
in september  headwaters sold all of its remaining high risk investments in exchange for a million note receivable from a limited liability corporation 
this note is due no later than september  is collateralized by the bridge loans and equity investments sold and is being accounted for on the cost recovery method 
following an impairment loss of approximately million recorded in  this note has a carrying value of million as of september  headwaters could incur additional losses if the remaining balance on the note is not repaid 
at september   in addition to the million note receivable  headwaters had outstanding one other note receivable in the amount of million 
this note and the related accrued interest were collected in october financing activities during also included proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately million 
headwaters intends to expand its business through growth of existing operations and strategic acquisitions of entities that operate in adjacent industries 
any acquisitions  however  would require the approval of current debt holders 
in july  headwaters filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the sec that can be used for the sale of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt and other securities  should headwaters so choose 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec in august  however  a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any securities to be issued is required to be filed before any offering would commence under the registration statement 
headwaters could use the proceeds from securities offered under the shelf registration to reduce long term debt  or for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
headwaters currently has no plans to utilize the shelf registration 
working capital 
headwaters working capital increased from million at september   to million at september  this increase in working capital resulted primarily from increased revenue and profitability and was partially offset by the cash used to acquire isg and an increase in the current portion of long term debt 
headwaters expects operations to produce positive cash flows in future periods  which  combined with current working capital and the million revolving line of credit described below  is expected to be sufficient for headwaters operating needs for the next months 
long term debt 
in connection with the isg acquisition  headwaters entered into a million senior secured credit agreement with a syndication of lenders  under which a total of million was borrowed on the acquisition date 
the remaining million is available for borrowing under the terms of this credit agreement 
this debt was issued at a discount and headwaters received net cash proceeds of million 
the debt is secured by all assets of headwaters  bears interest at a variable rate approximately at september   and is repayable quarterly beginning december through august required principal repayments total million in  million in  and  and million in in certain situations  for example when headwaters receives excess cash flow  as defined  mandatory prepayments are required 
mandatory prepayments are calculated as a percentage ranging up to of excess cash flow  which percentage is based on headwaters leverage ratio 
the debt agreement also allows optional prepayments 
headwaters currently expects to make prepayments that will retire the debt prior to its scheduled maturity 
the debt agreement contains restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  investments  merger and acquisition activity  asset liens  capital expenditures in excess of million in any fiscal year  and the payment of dividends  among others 
in addition  headwaters must maintain certain financial ratios  including leverage ratios and interest coverage  as those terms are defined in the credit agreement 
as of september   headwaters must maintain a total leverage ratio of or less 
the maximum ratio declines over time until june  at which time the ratio must remain at or less 
there is a similar leverage ratio requirement for the senior debt alone  which at september  must be or less  declining over time through june  at which time it must be maintained at or less 
the interest coverage requirement at september  was or more 
this ratio requirement increases over time  until december  at which time the ratio must be maintained at a level of or more 
headwaters was in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  under the terms of the senior secured credit agreement  headwaters may borrow up to a total million  provided  however  that  except for the initial million of available revolving credit  the maximum borrowing limit is permanently reduced by the amount of any repayments of the initial million borrowed in september terms of any additional borrowings under the credit agreement are generally the same as described in the preceding paragraphs 
finally  the credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity available under the total credit line 
as of november   two letters of credit for a total of approximately million have been issued with expiration dates of march and november no other borrowings have been drawn or letters of credit issued through november  headwaters pays a fee of on the unused portion of the revolving credit agreement 
also in connection with the isg acquisition  headwaters entered into a million subordinated loan agreement  under which senior subordinated debentures were issued at a discount  with headwaters receiving net cash proceeds of million 
isg management participated in one half  or million  of the million of debt issued 
the other half was issued to a corporation 
the debt is not secured  bears interest at an rate  and is repayable in september it is senior to all other debt except the senior secured debt described above 
the debt agreement allows for optional prepayments 
any prepayments paid to the corporation are subject to a prepayment charge which ranges from of the principal prepaid in the first year to of the principal prepaid in the last year of the five year term of the debt agreement 
interest is payable quarterly  beginning october and is payable in cash at a rate 
at headwaters option  interest calculated at an additional rate may be added to the principal balance in lieu of payment in cash 
headwaters currently intends to pay in cash the entire amount of interest which accrues 
the loan agreement contains restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  and these are generally consistent with those described above for the senior secured debt 
as of september   headwaters must maintain a total leverage ratio of or less 
the maximum ratio declines over time until june  at which time the ratio must remain at or less 
the interest coverage requirement at september  was or more 
this ratio requirement increases over time  until december  at which time the ratio must be maintained at a level of or more 
headwaters was in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  income taxes 
as of september   headwaters had net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes 
during  headwaters utilized all of these nols and tax credit carryforwards except for approximately million of hti s acquisition date nols that are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million due to the change in ownership of hti 
headwaters expects to utilize hti s remaining nols in and during  headwaters made estimated payments for alternative minimum taxes and for certain state income taxes in states where nols are not available 
due to the passage in march of the job creation and worker assistance act of the act  headwaters filed for a refund of the alternative minimum taxes paid in fiscal and filed for refunds related to the carryback of hti s and losses  which pursuant to the act can be carried back for five years instead of the statutory two year period 
due to nols for regular federal tax purposes and in many states where headwaters had operations  the provisions of the act allowing headwaters nols to offset of the alternative minimum tax liability for fiscal  and due to tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  headwaters did not pay significant amounts of income taxes in significant future cash needs  in addition to operational working capital requirements  are currently expected to consist primarily of i debt service payments on outstanding long term debt  ii income taxes  and iii capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are currently expected to be approximately million in  with somewhat higher requirements in succeeding years 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  headwaters has no significant off balance sheet transactions  derivatives  or similar instruments and is not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
the following table presents a summary of headwaters contractual obligations and payments  by period as of september  cash payments due by period millions of dollars total year years years after years senior secured debt senior subordinated debt other long term debt total long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations employment contracts  minimum royalties  and other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations subsequent to september   headwaters entered into a new headquarters office lease arrangement which expires in total minimum rental payments under the new lease agreement  which are not included above  total approximately million 
under the terms of the senior secured credit agreement  headwaters may borrow up to a total million  provided  however  that  except for the initial million of available revolving credit  the maximum borrowing limit is permanently reduced by the amount of any repayments of the initial million borrowed in september the credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity available under the total credit line 
as of november   two letters of credit for a total of approximately million have been issued with expiration dates of march and november no other borrowings have been drawn or letters of credit issued through november  headwaters is involved in several legal proceedings that have arisen out of the normal course of business  all as explained in more detail in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
of the five primary legal matters described in note  headwaters is a defendant in three cases  and both a plaintiff and defendant in two cases 
management in all cases intends to vigorously defend its position 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these activities will have a significant effect upon the operations or the financial position of headwaters  however  it is possible that a change in management s estimates of probable liability could occur and the change could be significant 
in regards to all of these legal matters  legal counsel cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amounts of recovery or liability 
recent accounting pronouncements headwaters has implemented sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  with the exception of certain additional disclosures which may not be early implemented 
full implementation of sfas no 
will require certain additional disclosures regarding isg s and hti s identified intangible assets and goodwill beginning october  in addition  sfas no 
 when fully implemented in fiscal  will require headwaters to review for impairment those intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 instead of following the existing rules for impairment testing 
the new rules require  among other things  that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit giving rise to the goodwill 
headwaters currently believes that neither the isg nor hti related identifiable assets and goodwill are impaired under either the existing rules for testing impairment  or under the new rules required by sfas no 
in april  sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  was issued 
sfas no 
 in rescinding sfas no 
 will require that the loss on early extinguishment of debt  classified as an extraordinary item in  no longer be classified as extraordinary  but rather as other expense 
sfas no 
is required to be implemented by headwaters in and management does not expect it to have a material effect on headwaters future financial position or results of operations 
in august  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was issued  and in july  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued 
these pronouncements must be implemented by headwaters as of october  and january   respectively 
headwaters has reviewed these standards and all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their potential effect  if any  on the future results of operations or financial position of headwaters 
based on that review  headwaters does not currently believe that any of these recent accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on its current or future financial position or results of operations 
impact of inflation during  headwaters operations were not materially impacted by inflation 
forward looking statements statements in this annual report on form k regarding headwaters expectations as to the managing and marketing of coal combustion products  operation of facilities utilizing alternative fuel technologies  the marketing of alternative fuels  the receipt of licensing fees  royalties  and product sales revenues  the development  commercialization and financing of new technologies and other strategic business opportunities and acquisitions and other information about headwaters that is not purely historical by nature  including those statements regarding headwaters future business plans  the operation of facilities  the availability of tax credits  the availability of feedstocks  and the marketability of the coal combustion products and alternative fuel  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although headwaters believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations 
in addition to matters affecting the coal combustion products and alternative fuel industries or the economy generally  factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations stated in these forward looking statements include  among others  the following ability to repay our substantial debt obligations  including significant interest payments  under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures 
restrictions on our ability to operate the businesses because of covenants in the senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures 
satisfactory resolution of several significant disputes in litigation 
increased use and market acceptance of fly ash 
fluctuations in the price and sales of cement and concrete products markets in which isg competes 
clean air act amendments and regulations that could adversely impact coal consumption or the quality and quantity of coal combustion products 
potential property damage claims and the availability of insurance coverage for claims related to isg s stucco and other building products 
operating issues for licensed alternative fuel facilities including feedstock availability  moisture content  btu content  correct application of chemical reagent  achieving significant chemical change  operability of equipment  production capacity  product durability  resistance to water absorption  overall costs of operations and other commercial factors surrounding the use of covol fuels technologies 
marketing issues relating to acceptance and regulatory permitting of alternative fuels manufactured using covol fuels technologies 
securing of suitable alternative fuel facility sites  including permits and raw materials  for relocation and operation of alternative fuel facilities and product sales 
the market acceptance of products manufactured with headwaters technologies in the face of competition from traditional products 
dependence on licensees to successfully implement covol fuels technologies and to make license and other payments to covol fuels 
maintenance of placed in service and other requirements under section of the tax code by alternative fuel manufacturing facilities 
changes in governmental regulations or failure to comply with existing regulations that could result in reduction or shutdown of operations of licensee alternative fuel facilities 
the continued availability of tax credits to licensees under the tax code and each licensee s ability to use tax credits 
the commercial feasibility of covol fuels alternative fuel technologies upon the expiration of tax credits 
ability to commercialize new technologies which have only been tested in the laboratory and not in full scale operations 
ability to commercialize the technology of hti and to implement new business plans which are at an early stage of investigation and investment and which will require significant time  management  and capital investment 
success of hti in conducting business in china 
success in the face of competition by others producing coal combustion products or alternative chemical reagent products 
sufficiency of intellectual property protections 
successful integration of recent acquisitions and retention of key management personnel 
risk factors affecting future results of operations leverage risks we have substantial debt and have significant interest payment requirements under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures 
as of the closing of the acquisition of isg and the related bank financing  we have approximately million in debt outstanding 
subject to restrictions in our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures  we may also incur significant amounts of additional debt for working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes 
our high level of combined debt could have important consequences for our company  including the following o we may have difficulty borrowing money for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  o we will need to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay interest and the required principal payments on borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  o our senior debt has a variable rate of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates  o borrowings under our senior secured credit facility is secured by all our assets  o we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  o we may be less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new products and services  and o we may not be able to implement our business plans 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures 
if unable to generate such cash flow  we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms or without substantial additional expense to us 
these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
covenant restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures may limit our ability to operate our business 
our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures contain  among other things  covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs  to acquire additional businesses or to engage in other business activities 
our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures restrict  among other things  our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to o borrow money  o pay dividends or make distributions  o purchase or redeem stock  o make investments and extend credit  o engage in transactions with affiliates  o engage in sale leaseback transactions  o consummate certain asset sales  o effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and o create liens on our assets 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures and other material agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests 
we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests or that our senior lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures and other material agreements 
if an event of default under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures occurs  our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
such a default may  in turn  cause a default under or an acceleration of our other outstanding indebtedness and some of our material agreements 
in such a case  there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance or otherwise repay such indebtedness 
litigation risk we are involved in significant litigation 
we are a party to some significant legal proceedings 
these proceedings will require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time  and other personnel resources and costs 
adverse resolution of these proceedings could have a materially negative effect on such things as i potential future revenues from licensees  ii our financial liabilities  and iii the strength of some aspects of our intellectual property in the alternative fuels industry 
see item legal proceedings for a description of the material pending legal proceedings 
covol fuels risks commercial viability of alternative fuel facilities depends on the continued existence of tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
because to date the profitability of the alternative fuel facilities that qualify for tax credits under section depends upon the economic benefits from the tax credits in addition to the profits  if any  from operations  our profits currently depend upon the existence of the tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
moreover  royalty payments under our license agreements are typically based on a percentage of tax credits or profits earned 
under current law  section expires on december   after which tax credits will not apply to the alternative fuel facilities 
in addition  there have been legislative initiatives from time to time to consider the early repeal or modification of section  although they have not been successful 
to date  coal based solid alternative fuel facilities that are not eligible for tax credits have not been built  and we believe they could not presently be operated profitably 
if the tax credits are not extended  or section is repealed or adversely modified prior to the end of  licensees  in order to remain competitive and commercially viable after  will have to manage their costs of production and feedstock and develop the market for coal based solid alternative fuel with adequate prices to cover the costs 
following  absent an extension of tax credits  or any earlier repeal of section  we will need to renegotiate our license agreements with licensees to take into account the absence of tax credits 
if our licensees close their facilities after  it would have a material adverse effect on our business 
ongoing financial profitability of covol fuels depends on operational success of licensees 
covol fuels has licensed its coal based solid alternative fuel technology to a limited number of licensees 
covol fuels profitability depends on the ability of its licensees to produce and sell alternative fuel that will generate license fees 
there are alternative fuel facilities that license covol fuels technologies 
to date  covol fuels has earned license fees from the owners of facilities  but most of the ongoing royalties earned to date have been generated by eight facilities owned by three licensees 
if any one of these licensees shuts down its facilities  operates its facilities at low production levels  or sells its facilities resulting in short term or long term disruption of operations  our revenues could be materially adversely affected 
to successfully operate a facility  the plant owner must produce and market a high quality coal based solid alternative fuel 
in order to do so  covol fuels licensees must address all operational issues including  but not limited to  feedstock availability  cost  moisture content  btu content  correct chemical reagent formulation and application  operability of equipment  product durability  resistance to water absorption and overall costs of operations 
in some cases  licensees may be forced to relocate plants and enter into new strategic contracts to address marketing and operational issues 
for example  some of the owners of facilities are moving the facilities to new sites with better sources of raw materials for operation 
licensee plant relocations disrupt production and delay generation of license fees for us 
it is not certain how much time our licensees will require for the full resolution of all of these marketing and operational issues 
covol fuels profitable financial results have depended in part on increased production over time of coal based solid alternative fuel by its licensees 
while to date efficiencies in production and improvements in facilities equipment and processes have allowed increased production  and we believe that capacity of the facilities can continue to be increased  capacity is ultimately finite for the specific facilities and could limit growth in the future 
covol fuels licensees may not qualify for tax credits granted by congress to encourage production of alternative fuels 
section of the internal revenue code provides a tax credit for the production and sale of qualified alternative fuel  including coal based solid alternative fuel produced by using covol fuels technologies 
covol fuels royalties and chemical sales revenues are ultimately derived from its licensees ability to manufacture and sell qualified fuels that generate tax credits for the facility owners 
the irs has issued at least private letter rulings to licensees of covol fuels technologies covering alternative fuel facilities 
these rulings may be modified or revoked by the internal revenue service irs if the irs adopts regulations that are different from these rulings 
also  a private letter ruling may not apply if the actual operating practice differs from the information given to the irs for the ruling 
the irs from time to time reviews taxpayer use of the section tax credit  including whether there should be restrictions on the availability of such credits 
as discussed above  ultimately it is within the power of congress to repeal or extend section therefore  tax credits may not be available in the future  which would materially adversely impact us 
based upon the language of section and private letter rulings issued by the irs to covol fuels and its licensees  covol fuels and its licensees believe the coal based solid alternative fuel facilities built and completed prior to july   are eligible for section tax credits 
however  the ability to claim tax credits is dependent upon a number of conditions including  but not limited to  the following o the facilities were constructed pursuant to a binding contract entered into before january   o all steps were taken for the facility to be considered placed in service prior to july   o manufacturing procedures are applied to produce a significant chemical change and hence a qualified fuel  o the alternative fuel is sold to an unrelated party  and o the owner of the facility is in a tax paying position and can therefore use the tax credits 
licensees are subject to audit by the irs 
the irs may challenge covol fuels licensees on any one of these or other conditions 
also  covol fuels licensees may not be in a financial position to claim the tax credits if they are not profitable and therefore reduce the alternative fuel produced at their facility 
in addition  the section credit is subject to phase out after the unregulated oil price reaches a certain level  adjusted annually for inflation 
the inability of a licensee to claim tax credits could potentially reduce our income from the licensee 
covol fuels must be able to develop and improve our alternative fuel technologies 
covol fuels current business is dependent upon alternative fuel technologies 
to remain competitive  we must be able to develop or refine our technologies to keep up with future alternative fuel requirements 
as licensees develop and modify their operations and choices of coal feedstocks  we will need to find new methods  know how  chemicals  and other techniques to meet licensee and customer demands  such as demands for improved efficiencies  lower costs  and improvements in alternative fuel products  including chemical change and improved physical characteristics 
if we are unable to develop or refine our technologies  our revenues and business could be materially harmed 
hti risks hti s technologies may not be commercially developed and marketed profitably 
headwaters acquired hti  in august as an early stage company  hti focuses on developing and commercializing catalysts and catalytic processes for producing chemicals and converting low value fossil fuels into high value alternative fuels 
although hti has developed and patented several potential processes  these processes are still in the developmental stage 
market acceptance of these processes  if at all  will depend on our ability to enter into agreements with licensees to further develop and provide adequate funding to commercialize the processes 
we can give no assurances that we will be able to enter into any of these agreements or that adequate funding will be available to fully develop and successfully commercialize those processes or that they can be marketed profitably 
hti will conduct business in china 
hti has recently entered into agreements with shenhua group  china s largest coal company  which will license its direct coal liquefaction coal technology for use in plants in china 
in addition  other hti activities are likely to involve licensing of other technologies in china 
there is the risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as under united states laws  leaving us vulnerable to competitors who may attempt to copy our products  processes or technologies 
further  the legal system of china is based on statutory law 
under this system  prior court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority but do not have binding precedential effect 
since  the chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws and considerable progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters  such as corporate organization and governance  foreign investment  commerce  taxation and trade 
as these laws  regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and because of the limited volume of published case law and judicial interpretations and the non binding nature of prior court decisions  the interpretation and enforcement of these laws  regulations and legal requirements involve some uncertainty 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protection or recourse available to us 
in addition  dependence on foreign licenses and conducting foreign operations may subject us to increased risk to political change  ownership issues  or repatriation or currency exchange concerns 
isg risks isg s business is dependent upon increased use and market acceptance of fly ash 
isg s business strategy is to increase the use of fly ash in cement and concrete through its marketing initiatives  which emphasize the environmental  cost  and performance advantages of fly ash 
if isg s marketing initiatives are not successful in the construction industry  or if environmental regulation does not continue to emphasize the use and recycling of coal combustion products or ccps and therefore the use of the fly ash  isg may not be able to sustain its operations and future growth 
isg s business is dependent upon the price and sales of cement and concrete 
a significant portion of isg s business is based on the sale of cement and concrete products containing fly ash 
there is currently an overcapacity of cement and concrete in the world market  causing potential price decreases 
although the markets for isg s products are regional  isg s business is affected by the availability of competing products 
in addition  any slowing of the construction business in isg s markets  particularly highway construction  could adversely affect isg s sales 
clean air act amendments could adversely impact coal consumption 
the federal clean air act of and subsequent amendments particularly the clean air act amendments of  and corresponding state laws  which regulate the emissions of materials into the air  affect the coal industry both directly and indirectly 
the coal industry is directly affected by clean air act permitting requirements and or emissions control requirements  including requirements relating to particulate matter such as  fugitive dust 
the coal industry may also be impacted by future regulation of fine particulate matter 
in july  the united states environmental protection agency  or epa  adopted new  more stringent national ambient air quality standards  or naaqs  for particulate matter and ozone 
because electric utilities emit nitrogen oxides  which are precursors to ozone  isg s utility customers are likely to be affected when the new naaqs are implemented by the states 
state and federal regulations relating to fugitive dust and the implementation of the new naaqs may reduce isg s sources for its products 
the extent of the potential impact of the new naaqs on the coal industry will depend on the policies and control strategies associated with the state implementation process under the clean air act 
nonetheless  the new naaqs could have a material adverse effect on isg s financial condition and results of operations 
the clean air act indirectly affects isg s operations by limiting the air emissions of sulfur dioxide and other compounds emitted by coal fired utility power plants 
the affected utilities have been and may be able to meet these requirements by  among other things  switching to lower sulfur fuels  installing pollution control devices such as scrubbers  reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing or trading pollution credits 
the affect on isg  of the clean air act regulation of emissions cannot be completely ascertained at this time 
the clean air act amendments require utilities that are currently major sources of nitrogen oxides in moderate or higher ozone non attainment areas to install reasonably available control technology for nitrogen oxides 
epa currently plans to finalize stricter ozone naaqs discussed above by epa promulgated a rule the sip call in requiring eastern states to make substantial reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions 
under this rule  epa expects that states will achieve these reductions by requiring power plants to make substantial reductions in their nitrogen oxide emissions 
installation of reasonably available control technology and additional control measures required under the sip call will make it more costly to operate coal fired utility power plants and could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
any material reduction in coal s share of the capacity for power generation could have a material adverse effect on isg s financial condition and results of operations 
the effect that such regulation or other requirements may have on the coal industry in general and on isg in particular cannot be predicted with certainty 
no assurance can be given that the implementation of the clean air act amendments or any future regulatory provisions will not materially adversely affect isg 
in addition  the clean air act amendments require a study of utility power plant emissions of certain toxic substances  including mercury  and direct epa to regulate these substances  if warranted 
epa has submitted reports to congress on mercury and utility air toxics 
on december   epa announced its finding that regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions from oil and coal fired electric utility steam generating units is necessary and appropriate 
epa expects to propose emission standards by december  and to finalize them by december  these regulations are likely to require reductions in mercury emissions  and such requirements  if promulgated  could result in reduced use of coal if utilities switch to other sources of fuel 
the clear skies initiative  announced by the bush administration in february  seeks to develop strategies for reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides and mercury from power plants 
because the initiative is still in its early stages  its effect on isg cannot be determined at this time 
isg s business is dependent upon the quality and quantity of the ccps it uses in its products 
coal fired boilers have been impacted by regulations under the clean air act and the clean air act amendments  which established specific emissions levels for sulfur dioxide  or sox  and nitrogen oxides  or nox 
these emissions levels have required utilities to undertake many of the following changes change their fuel source s  add scrubbers to capture sulfur dioxide  add new boiler burner systems to control nox  add or modify fuel pulverizers air handling systems to control nox  introduce flue gas conditioning materials to control particulate emissions in conjunction with meeting sulfur dioxide emissions targets and in some very isolated cases shut down a plant 
all of these changes can impact the quantity and quality of ccps produced at a power plant 
furthermore  proposed regulations to control mercury emissions could result in implementation of additional technologies at power plants that could negatively affect fly ash quality 
inappropriate use of ccps can result in faulty end products 
property damage claims against isg  uncertainty of insurance coverage  litigation 
isg and its subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal proceedings  including property damage actions related to its stucco and mortar manufactured products 
currently  each of the proceedings is being defended by attorneys retained by various insurance carriers pursuant to reservation of rights letters 
while  to date  none of these proceedings have required that isg incur substantial costs  there is no guarantee of coverage or continuing coverage  and these and future proceedings may result in substantial costs to isg  including attorneys fees  managerial time  and other personnel resources and costs 
adverse resolution of these proceedings could have a materially negative effect on isg s business  financial condition and results of operation  and its ability to meet its financial obligations 
although isg carries general and product liability insurance  isg cannot assure that such insurance coverage will remain available  that isg s insurance carrier will remain viable or that the insured amounts will cover all future claims in excess of isg s uninsured retention 
furthermore  future rate increases may make such insurance uneconomical for isg to maintain 
isg s business could be adversely affected by fluctuations in seasonality and cyclicality 
isg s business consists of managing ccps and other materials for utilities and other industrial facilities and marketing these materials to end users 
materials management services often include disposal operations and landfill services that are directly tied to year round plant operations  providing relatively evenly distributed revenue generation 
however  ccp sales are keyed to construction market demands that tend to generally follow national trends in construction with predictable responses to seasonal peaks 
isg s ccp sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends  with the largest percentage of total annual revenues being realized in the quarters ended june and september low seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the quarter ended march the ccp industry is cyclical and is affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as building construction and highway infrastructure repair construction 
a downturn in the economy in one or more markets served by isg could have a material adverse effect on isg s sales 
if isg s coal fired electric utility industry suppliers fail to provide isg with ccps on a timely basis  isg s costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
isg currently relies on the production of ccps by coal fired electric utilities 
isg has occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving ccps from its coal fired electric utility suppliers and may  in the future be unable to obtain ccps on the scale and within the time frames required by isg to meet its customers needs 
if isg is unable to obtain  or if it experiences a delay in the delivery of ccps  isg may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative sources of ccps or to otherwise maintain supply to its customers 
operational risks we have significant competition 
coal based solid alternative fuels made using covol fuels technologies compete with other alternative fuel products  as well as traditional fuels 
competition may come in the form of the licensing of competing technologies to process coal derivatives  the marketing of competitive chemical reagents  the marketing of end products qualifying as synthetic fuel  and the development of alternative fuel projects 
covol fuels also experiences competition from traditional coal and fuel suppliers and natural resource producers  in addition to those companies that specialize in the recycling and upgrading of industrial waste products 
these companies may have greater financial  management and other resources than covol fuels has 
further  many industrial coal users are limited in the amount of alternative fuel product they can purchase from covol fuels licensees because they have committed to purchase a substantial portion of their coal requirements through long term contracts for standard coal 
covol fuels may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
alternative fuel sources and the recycling of waste products are the subject of extensive research and development by our competitors 
if a competitive technology is developed that greatly increases the demand for waste products or reduces the costs of alternative fuels or other resources  the economic viability of our technologies and business could be adversely affected 
generally  the markets for isg s traditional ccps and manufactured products are highly competitive  with many local  regional and national companies that compete for market share in these areas with similar products and with numerous other products which are substitutable 
isg competes with respect to obtaining materials management contracts with utility and other industrial companies  the marketing of ccps and related industrial materials  and the marketing of its manufactured products 
the markets for the management of ccps  related industrial materials and manufactured products are highly fragmented 
although isg believes it is the largest manager of ccps in north america and the only company providing such management services on a national basis  due to the high cost of transportation relative to sales price  competition is generally regional 
isg has a presence in every region in the united states 
although isg typically has long term contracts with its clients  some of such contracts provide for the termination of such contract at the convenience of the utility company upon a minimum day notice 
moreover  some of isg s most significant competitors on a regional basis appear to be seeking a broader national presence 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than isg  and there can be no assurance that if they were to begin to compete in the national market  or in regions where they currently do not have operations  isg would not be adversely affected 
if we fail to successfully manage or integrate acquisitions of companies or technologies  such as the acquisition of isg  our business may be disrupted and harmed 
successful management and integration of acquisitions  such as the acquisition of isg  are subject to a number of risks  including o difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies or products including loss of key employees  o diversion of management s attention from core business operations  o adverse effects on business relationships with suppliers and customers or those of the acquired business  o assumption of contingent liabilities  and o incurrence of potential significant write offs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our acquisition of isg 
further  as part of our general business strategy  we may seek to acquire or invest in other businesses  products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in addition to the risks outlined above  our ability to successfully implement our strategy is subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in identifying acceptable acquisition candidates  consummating acquisitions on favorable terms and obtaining adequate financing  which may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and services and to compete in our rapidly changing marketplace 
in addition  if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our acquisition strategy  that such strategy will improve our operating results  or that these activities will not have a significant dilutive effect on existing shareholders 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe upon  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and may be in the future  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms  precluding our use of the applicable technology 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology 
these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may materially harm our business and prospects 
headwaters and its subsidiaries operations must comply with government environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental regulation 
hti s ordinary course of business involves using its facilities to perform r d activities  process and recycle oil and to research and develop technologies involving waste coal  oil chemicals and energy technologies  including liquefaction of coal 
as a result  petroleum and other hazardous materials have been and are present on hti s properties 
regulatory noncompliance or accidental discharges  in spite of safeguards  could create an environmental liability 
therefore operations entail risk of environmental damage and we could incur liabilities in the future arising from the discharge of pollutants into the environment or from waste disposal practices 
materials sold by isg vary in chemical composition 
although fossil fuel combustion wastes have been excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the epa has determined that regulations are warranted for coal combustion wastes disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments  or used to fill surface or underground mines 
epa is planning to publish a proposed rulemaking in march isg manages a number of landfill and pond operations that may be affected by epa s proposed regulations 
in most of these operations permits are contractually retained by the client and the client would be liable for any costs associated with new permitting requirements 
however  the effect of such regulations on isg cannot be completely ascertained at this time 
while ccps are not hazardous wastes under rcra  they may contain small concentrations of metals that are considered as hazardous substances under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla 
land application of ccps is regulated by a variety of federal and state statutes  which impose testing and management requirements to ensure environmental protection
