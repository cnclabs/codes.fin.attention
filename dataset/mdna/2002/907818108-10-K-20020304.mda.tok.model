item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements  item  and other information included in this form k 
as stated in item  union pacific corporation consists of two reportable segments  rail and trucking  as well as upc s other product lines other 
the rail segment includes the operations of uprr and uprr s subsidiaries and rail affiliates collectively  the railroad 
the trucking segment includes the operations of overnite and  subsequent to november   motor cargo 
the corporation s other product lines are comprised of the corporate holding company which largely supports the railroad  fenix llc and affiliated technology companies fenix  self insurance activities  and all appropriate consolidating entries see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
compared to results of operations consolidated net income the corporation reported record net income of million per basic share and per diluted share in compared to million per basic share and per diluted share in excluding the effect of a million pre tax million after tax charge in related to a work force reduction plan at the railroad  net income was million per basic share and per diluted share 
the increase in net income excluding the work force reduction charge in was due primarily to revenue growth  productivity gains and cost control  lower non operating expense and lower fuel prices 
operating revenues operating revenues increased million to a record billion in  reflecting growth at the railroad and growth in the trucking segment 
the corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million to billion in from billion in excluding the effect of the work force reduction charge in  operating expenses increased million compared to reflecting wage and benefit inflation and higher equipment rents and depreciation expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in employment levels at the railroad  lower fuel prices and cost control efforts 
lower fuel prices in versus reduced fuel expense by million in salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million compared to excluding the work force reduction charge  salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million  as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity 
equipment and other rents expense increased million as a result of additional locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times  which indicates that cars spent more time on the rail system between shipments 
partially offsetting these increases were lower costs due to declines in rail traffic requiring rental of freight cars 
in addition  the railroad experienced lower rental rates  and overnite experienced lower contract transportation costs 
depreciation expense increased million as a result of the railroad s capital spending in recent years which increased the total value of the corporation s assets subject to depreciation see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
fuel and utilities costs were down million compared to due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption rate  partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the railroad and losses on fuel hedging activity see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
materials and supplies expense decreased million primarily due to reduced locomotive repairs and cost control actions 
casualty costs increased million over due to higher insurance  bad debts and environmental expenses 
other costs decreased million as productivity and cost control efforts more than offset higher state and local taxes 
operating income operating income increased million to billion in excluding the effect of the million work force reduction charge in  operating income increased million as revenue growth  productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation  increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume 
non operating items interest expense decreased million compared to due to lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in in  the corporation s weighted average debt level decreased from  million in to  million in the corporation s weighted average interest rate was in as compared to in other income increased million in compared to due primarily to higher real estate sales 
income tax expense increased million in over excluding the effect of the million work force reduction charge on income tax expense in  income taxes for increased million over the increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in key measures net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to in from in net income as a percentage of operating revenues in  excluding the work force reduction charge  was 
return on average common shareholders equity was in  up from in excluding the charge in  return on average common shareholders equity was in the corporation s operating ratio was in compared to in and in  excluding the work force reduction charge 
rail segment net income rail operations reported record net income of billion in compared to net income of million in  up 
excluding the work force reduction charge in  net income was million 
the increase in earnings resulted from higher commodity revenue and real estate sales combined with lower fuel expense  interest expense and materials and supplies expense 
these improvements were partially offset by inflation  lower other revenue and higher equipment rent and depreciation expenses 
operating revenues rail operating revenues increased million over to a record billion 
revenue carloads were flat with an increase in the energy and agricultural commodity groups offset by decreases in the other four commodity groups 
the decrease in other revenue was the result of lower switching  subsidiary and accessorial revenues 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue  revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type commodity revenue in millions of dollars change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   revenue carloads in thousands change agricultural automotive chemicals energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   average revenue per car change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal total   agricultural revenue increased  due primarily to a increase in average revenue per car 
carloads were flat  as higher corn shipments and meals and oils exports were offset by a decrease in demand for domestic and export wheat shipments and a poor sugar beet harvest 
revenue gains were also achieved through increased beer imports from mexico  wine shipments from california to eastern markets  express service of fresh and frozen products and increased demand for cottonseed 
average revenue per car increased due to a longer average length of haul  resulting from fewer short haul wheat and sweetener shipments combined with increased long haul domestic and mexico corn shipments 
automotive revenue declined as a result of a decrease in carloads and a increase in average revenue per car 
materials volumes declined  as the soft economy and a decline in vehicle sales led to high inventories  low industry production and auto plant shutdowns 
total finished vehicle shipments declined only  as industry weakness was mitigated by market share gains 
consumer incentives in the fourth quarter stimulated vehicle sales and helped offset weakness early in the year 
average revenue per car increased due to a shift in mix of materials shipped  resulting from fewer shipments of materials with lower average revenue per car 
additionally  more materials were shipped in boxcars rather than containers  which yield higher average revenue per car than containers 
chemicals revenue declined  due to a decrease in carloads 
volume declines were the result of the soft economy  as reduced demand for consumer durables led to high manufacturer inventories and weak demand for plastics 
reduced industrial manufacturing also depressed demand for liquid and dry chemicals 
fertilizer and phosphate rock revenues decreased as high energy costs early in the year reduced the market for these commodities 
average revenue per car was flat  as the positive impact of fewer low average revenue per car phosphate rock shipments was offset by a decrease in average revenue per car for soda ash shipments 
energy energy commodity revenue increased compared to  due to a increase in carloads 
records were set in for total carloads  revenue and coal trains loaded per day in the southern powder river basin in wyoming and in the coal mining regions of colorado and utah 
these increases were driven by strong utility demand caused by severe winter weather in late and the first quarter of in the first half of the year  demand for coal also increased due to the high cost of alternative fuels  such as natural gas  fuel oil and higher priced eastern sourced coal 
carloads also increased due to gains in market share 
industrial products revenue decreased  as a decline in carloads was partially offset by a increase in average revenue per car 
the decline was mainly the result of the economic slowdown  which had a negative effect on many economically sensitive commodities including steel and paper markets 
steel producers were additionally impacted by high levels of low cost imported steel  which forced plant shutdowns and bankruptcies 
newsprint and fiber revenue declined due to lack of demand for printed advertising 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in construction related commodities  led by stone and cement  as strong building and road construction activity continued in the south and southwestern regions of the country 
lumber volumes increased due to strong housing construction and uncertainty surrounding restrictions on canadian lumber imports 
average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul business 
these gains were partially offset by the impact of increased shipments of stone  which generates lower average revenue per car 
intermodal revenue was flat  as a decline in carloads was offset by a increase in average revenue per car 
the volume decrease was primarily the result of soft economic demand for domestic shipments 
in addition  the voluntary action of shedding low margin trailer business in favor of higher margin containers contributed to the decline 
partially offsetting the domestic declines were increases in international shipments  the result of higher import demand 
the increase in average revenue per car was primarily the result of price increases 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million to billion in excluding the million work force reduction charge in  operating expenses were essentially flat 
higher expenses as a result of inflation  higher equipment rents expense and depreciation were offset by savings from lower force levels  productivity gains and cost control efforts and lower fuel prices 
salaries  wages and employee benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million in to billion 
excluding the million work force reduction charge in  salaries  wages and employee benefits expense increased million 
the primary driver of the increase was wage and employee benefits inflation 
a gross ton mile increase also added volume costs 
a reduction in employee force levels as a result of the work force reduction plan offset a significant portion of these higher costs 
equipment and other rents expenses increased million compared to due primarily to higher locomotive leases and longer car cycle times 
the higher locomotive lease expense is due to the railroad s increased leasing of new  more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives 
these new locomotives replaced older  non leased models in the fleet  which helped reduce expenses for depreciation  labor  materials and fuel during the year 
the increase in car cycle times is partially attributable to a decline in automotive shipments earlier in the year  which resulted in excess freight cars being stored at assembly plants and unloading facilities 
partially offsetting the increases in expenses were lower volume costs  lower car leases and lower prices for equipment 
the decrease in volume costs was attributable to a decline in carloads in business segments such as industrial products and intermodal that utilize a high percentage of rented freight cars 
depreciation depreciation expense increased million over  resulting from capital spending in recent years 
capital spending totaled billion in and in and billion in fuel and utilities expenses decreased million 
the decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate  as measured by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles 
fuel prices averaged cents per gallon in compared to cents per gallon in  including taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of cents and cents in and  respectively 
the railroad hedged approximately of its fuel consumption for the year  which increased fuel costs by million 
as of december   expected fuel consumption for is hedged at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and for is hedged at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
materials and supplies expenses decreased million  reflecting locomotive overhaul reductions and productivity improvements and cost control measures 
locomotive overhauls decreased due to acquisition of new  more reliable locomotives during the year and the sale of older units  which required higher maintenance 
materials and supplies expenses related to car maintenance also declined due to lower business levels in the industrial products and automotive commodity groups 
the cars utilized in these commodity groups normally require more maintenance than the cars utilized within the other commodity groups 
casualty costs costs increased million compared to  as higher insurance  bad debt and environmental expenses were partially offset by lower personal injury costs and lower costs for damaged freight cars 
other costs expenses increased million flat compared to primarily due to higher state and local taxes

non operating items non operating expense decreased million compared to real estate sales and net other income increased million 
interest expense decreased million as a result of lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in income taxes increased million in compared to excluding the work force reduction charge in  income tax expense increased million 
the increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in trucking segment operating revenues in  trucking revenues rose million to  million 
the growth resulted from rate increases  new services and million in incremental revenue due to the acquisition of motor cargo 
tonnage for the year was flat compared to operating expenses trucking operating expenses rose million to  million in salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million due to a increase in employees as well as wage and benefit inflation and enhancements 
fuel and utilities costs decreased million  as a result of lower fuel prices during the year cents per gallon average in compared to cents per gallon average in  including transportation costs and regional pricing spreads  and excluding taxes  partially offset by a increase in gallons consumed 
overnite did not hedge any fuel volume for the year ended december  however  as of december   overnite had hedged approximately of its expected fuel consumption for at an average of cents per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and had hedged approximately of its expected fuel consumption for at an average of cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
equipment and other rents decreased million due to decreased use of contract transportation during the year 
high utilization of contract transportation in was necessary due to teamsters related work stoppage 
casualty costs increased million due to higher bad debt  insurance and cargo loss and damage expenses 
other costs decreased million due to lower expenses related to decreased security related to teamsters matters  legal and employee travel expenses in operating income trucking operations generated operating income of million in  compared to million for the operating ratio increased to  compared to in other product lines other operating losses increased million in compared to operating revenues declined million year over year 
operating expenses increased million due to increased spending at fenix to develop new products and services

excluding the work force reduction charge  net income was million in operating revenues rail operating revenues increased million over to a record billion 
revenue carloads increased over with gains in five of the six commodity groups 
other revenue gains were the result of higher subsidiary revenues and increased accessorial services 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue  revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type commodity revenue in millions of dollars change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   revenue carloads in thousands change agricultural automotive chemicals energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   average revenue per car change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal total   agricultural revenue declined  as a decrease in carloads more than offset a increase in average revenue per car 
carloads decreased primarily due to reduced export demand for wheat and corn and a lack of producer selling in anticipation of higher prices 
revenue increased for fresh fruits and vegetables primarily as a result of new express train service from the pacific northwest and northern california to eastern markets 
beverage revenue increased due to new wine shipments out of california and higher domestic beer carloads 
average revenue per car increased primarily due to an increase in longer haul traffic  particularly domestic corn shuttle shipments to california 
automotive revenue increased as a result of a increase in carloads 
both revenue and carload totals were all time records  resulting from strong demand for finished vehicles and parts  market share gains and improved rail service 
business volume with mexico was particularly strong due to increased vehicle production levels and more reliable and expanded rail service 
new service offerings facilitated the conversion of automotive parts shipments from truck to the railroad 
increased container shipments of automotive parts  rather than boxcar shipments  caused average revenue per car to decrease slightly 
chemicals a increase in carloads combined with a increase in average revenue per car led to a increase in revenue 
revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in average revenue per car for soda ash  fertilizer  and liquid and dry commodities due to selected price increases 
year over year carload improvements came mainly in the first half of the year  as a strong economy and customer plant expansions led to increased market demand for plastics  liquid and dry chemicals and domestic soda ash 
however  a softening economy late in the year resulted in a decline in fourth quarter revenue compared to  with weakness in most areas of the chemical market 
energy energy revenue was down compared to  despite a increase in carloads for the year 
average revenue per car dropped as a result of contract pricing provisions with certain major customers 
in the first six months of  carloads declined compared to due to lower coal demand at utilities resulting from high inventories caused by mild winter weather and year stockpiles 
in the second half of  carloads increased over levels due to hot summer weather and the combination of cold winter weather late in the year and a significant increase in the price of alternative fuels 
delays due to severe winter weather partially offset volume gains in the second half of the year 
industrial products revenue increased on a increase in carloads and a increase in average revenue per car 
a strong economy in the first half of led to a general increase in demand for most business lines 
the largest revenue gains were in steel  lumber  cement and other building materials due to an expanding construction market  especially in the south and southwest 
new rail services and generally improved service performance also contributed to the increase in carloads 
starting in the third quarter  a softening in the economy began to adversely affect business demand 
fourth quarter revenue and carloads decreased in nearly all business lines but especially minerals  steel and hazardous waste 
the increase in average revenue per car was due to gains in higher average revenue per car  steel and lumber carloads and selected price increases during the year 
intermodal revenue increased due to a increase in carloads and a increase in average revenue per car 
carload growth resulted from a strong us economy in the first half of and increased demand for imports from asia 
improved service performance led to an increase in carloads and revenue for expedited premium service 
new and expanded rail service offerings also contributed to the gains 
the increase in average revenue per car was primarily the result of price increases and a longer average length of haul in some markets 
operating expenses operating expense increased million to billion in the higher expenses are primarily the result of significantly higher fuel prices  inflation  volume costs associated with a increase in carloads and higher depreciation expense  partially offset by productivity gains and other cost control measures 
operating expenses increased million to billion in  excluding the million pre tax charge for the work force reduction plan 
salaries  wages and employee benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million to billion 
costs decreased million  excluding the million pre tax work force reduction charge 
the primary driver was productivity improvements that resulted in lower train crew expenses despite a increase in carload volume 
in addition  the average employee count decreased from to partially offsetting these gains were increased costs due to greater rail volume and wage and employee benefit inflation 
equipment and other rents expenses decreased million compared to the improvement was attributable to lower prices for equipment and improvements in car cycle times  partially offset by higher volume related costs 
depreciation depreciation expense increased million over  resulting from capital spending in recent years 
capital spending totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in fuel and utilities expenses increased million 
the increase was driven by significantly higher fuel prices which added million of additional costs and higher volume 
fuel prices averaged cents per gallon in compared to cents per gallon in  including taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of cents for each of the years 
the railroad hedged approximately of its fuel consumption for the year  which decreased fuel costs by million

at january   the corporation had million remaining for issuance under the shelf registration 
the corporation has no immediate plans to issue equity securities under this shelf registration 
other significant financings during july  uprr entered into capital leases covering new locomotives 
the related capital lease obligations totaled approximately million and are included in the statements of consolidated financial position as debt see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
in december  the railroad entered into a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building which will be constructed in omaha  nebraska 
the expected completion date of the building is it will total approximately million square feet with approximately  office workspaces 
the cost to construct the new headquarters  including capitalized interest  is approximately million 
the corporation has guaranteed the railroad s obligation under this lease 
uprr will be the construction agent for the lessor 
total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding commitments as of december   were approximately million 
after construction is complete  the lease has an initial term of five years and provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to agreement between the railroad and lessor 
at any time during the lease  the railroad may  at its option  purchase the building at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building 
if the railroad elects not to renew the lease or purchase the building  the railroad has guaranteed a residual value of approximately million 
at december   the railroad has guaranteed  under certain circumstances  a residual value of less than million 
other matters personal injury the cost of injuries to employees and others on railroad property or in accidents involving the trucking segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
in  the railroad s work related injuries that resulted in lost job time declined compared to in addition  accidents at grade crossings decreased compared to annual expenses for the railroad s personal injury related events were million in  reflecting lower than anticipated settlement costs  million in and million in compensation for railroad work related accidents is governed by the federal employers liability act fela 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
the railroad offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
environmental costs the corporation generates and transports hazardous and nonhazardous waste in its current and former operations  and is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
the corporation has identified approximately active sites at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  the corporation s ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to other parties  in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site 
when environmental issues have been identified with respect to the property owned  leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the corporation s business  the corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such property 
the corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred 
the corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   the corporation has a liability of million accrued for future environmental costs 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as for ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws and regulations 
the corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability 
however  the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and or the speculative nature of remediation costs 
the corporation expects to pay out the majority of the december   environmental liability over the next five years  funded by cash generated from operations 
remediation of identified sites previously used in operations  used by tenants or contaminated by former owners required cash spending of million in  million in and million in the corporation is also engaged in reducing emissions  spills and migration of hazardous materials  and spent cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively  for control and prevention 
in  the corporation anticipates spending million for remediation and million for control and prevention 
the impact of current obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the corporation 
labor matters rail approximately of the railroad s nearly  employees are represented by major rail unions 
national negotiations under the railway labor act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late in may  the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe ratified a five year agreement  which included provisions for an annual wage increase based on the consumer price index and progressive health and welfare cost sharing 
the health and welfare cost sharing was a milestone as the bmwe is the first union to make significant cost contributions to their health and welfare plan 
contract discussions with the remaining unions are either in negotiation or mediation 
also during  much of the operating craft unions focus was on the proposed merger between the united transportation union and the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble 
in a december re vote  the ble resoundingly rejected the merger 
both operating craft unions have indicated a desire to complete national negotiations 
the corporation anticipates significant progress in trucking overnite continues to oppose the efforts of the teamsters to unionize overnite service centers 
since the teamsters began their efforts at overnite in  overnite has received petitions for union elections at of its service centers  although there have been only nine elections since august  and teamsters representation was rejected in seven of those nine elections 
twenty two service centers  representing approximately of overnite s nearly  nationwide employee work force  have voted for union representation  and the teamsters have been certified and recognized as the bargaining representative for such employees 
employees at of these locations have filed decertification petitions since elections affecting approximately additional employees are unresolved  and there are no elections currently scheduled 
additionally  proceedings are pending in certain cases where a teamsters local union lost a representation election 
to date  overnite has not entered into any collective bargaining agreements with the teamsters  who began a job action on october   that has continued into as of january   overnite service centers had approximately employees  less than of overnite s work force  who did not report to work 
despite the work stoppage  overnite has managed to improve its revenue and profitability on a year over year basis 
employees at two motor cargo service centers located in north salt lake  utah and reno  nevada  representing approximately of motor cargo s total work force at service centers  are covered by two separate collective bargaining agreements with unions affiliated with the teamsters 
although the agreements cover most of the employees at these two facilities  less than half of these covered employees are actual members of unions 
inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies such as the railroad  overnite and motor cargo 
as a result  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis  assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels  would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments the corporation and its subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments  which are subject to market risk  in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve the corporation s interest rate objectives 
the corporation uses swaps  futures and or forward contracts to mitigate adverse price movements and exposure to variable cash flows 
the use of these instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements 
the corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate changes and hedge the exposure to fair value changes 
the purpose of these programs is to protect the corporation s operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 
the corporation may also use fuel swaptions to secure more favorable swap prices 
swaptions are swaps that are extendable past their base period at the option of the counterparty 
swaptions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through the consolidated statements of income 
the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on the corporation s financial instruments 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
interest rates the corporation manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within its debt portfolio over a given period 
the mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or incremental borrowings are required 
derivatives are used in limited circumstances as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix and hedge the exposure to fair value changes 
in addition  the corporation obtains flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within its debt portfolio by issuing callable fixed rate debt securities 
at december  and  the corporation had variable rate debt representing approximately and  respectively  of its total debt 
if variable interest rates average higher in than the corporation s december  variable rate  which was approximately  the corporation s interest expense would increase by less than million after tax 
if variable interest rates had averaged higher in than the corporation s december  variable rate  the corporation s interest expense would have increased by less than million after tax 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of the corporation s variable rate debt at december  and  respectively 
in may and august  the corporation entered into interest rate swaps on a total of million of debt with varying maturity dates extending to november the swaps allowed the corporation to convert the debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor 
the swaps have been accounted for using the short cut method as allowed by financial accounting standards board statement fasb no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  and therefore  no ineffectiveness has been recorded within the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the effect of a interest rate increase or decrease in over the december  rates is included in the preceding or succeeding paragraph disclosure  respectively 
the corporation had not entered into any interest rate swaps at december  market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to approximately million at december  market risk resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december   amounted to approximately million at december  the fair values of the corporation s fixed rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
fuel fuel costs are a significant portion of the corporation s total operating expenses 
as a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical volatility of fuel prices  the corporation s transportation subsidiaries periodically use swaps  futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 
the corporation at times may use swaptions to secure more favorable swap prices 
as of december   expected rail fuel consumption for is hedged or swaptions are in place at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
as of december   expected rail fuel consumption for is hedged or swaptions are in place at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
for the corporation s fuel hedges  if rail fuel prices decrease from the december  level  the corresponding increase in fuel expense would be approximately million after tax 
for the corporation s swaptions  if rail fuel prices decrease from the december  level  the corresponding increase in expense would be approximately million after tax 
as of december   the corporation had hedged approximately of its forecasted fuel consumption at cents per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
if rail fuel prices had decreased from the december  level  the corresponding increase in fuel expense would have been approximately million after tax

 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities fas 
fas and fas require that the changes in fair value of all derivative financial instruments the corporation uses for fuel or interest rate hedging purposes be recorded in the corporation s consolidated statements of financial position 
in addition  to the extent fuel hedges are ineffective due to pricing differentials resulting from the geographic dispersion of the corporation s operations  income statement recognition of the ineffective portion of the hedge position may be required 
also  derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per fas and fas may require income statement recognition
