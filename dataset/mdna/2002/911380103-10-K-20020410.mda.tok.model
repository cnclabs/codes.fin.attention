the financing agreement provides a revolving line of credit for a term ending august  in the aggregate amount of million for the companies  subject to availability of credit as described in the following paragraphs 
the line of credit may be used on a revolving basis by any of the companies to support trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit and to finance loans 
as of february   trade letters of credit for the account of the companies and supported by cit were outstanding in the amount of million 
subject to the following paragraph  the availability of credit within the aggregate million line of credit to any of the companies at any time is the excess of its borrowing base over the sum of x the aggregate outstanding amount of its letters of credit and its revolving loans  if any  and y at cit s option  the sum of i unpaid sales taxes  and ii up to  in total liabilities of the companies under permitted encumbrances as defined in the financing agreement 
the borrowing base  as to any of the companies  is the sum of x a percentage of the book value of its eligible inventory both on hand and unfilled purchase orders financed with letters of credit  ranging from to depending on the season  and y the balance in an account in its name that has been pledged to the lenders a pledged account 
at february   the combined availability of the companies was million  the pledged account had a zero balance  the companies cash on hand was unrestricted  and no loan had been drawn down

in the event a revolving loan is made to one of the companies  interest is payable monthly based on a day year at the prime rate or at two percent plus the libor rate on a per annum basis  at the borrower s option 
the line of credit is secured by a security interest in inventory and proceeds and by the balance from time to time in the pledged account

trade credit arises from the willingness of the company s domestic vendors to grant extended payment terms for inventory purchases and is generally financed either by the vendor or a third party factor 
the availability of trade credit depends on the company s liquidity in general and the amount of its cash and cash equivalents and availability of unused credit under the financing agreement in particular

this paragraph constitutes forward looking information under the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act and is subject to the uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
critical accounting policies introduction financial statements prepared by companies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are affected by the policies followed by their managements in preparing them 
some accounting policies require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by corporate management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
among the most important accounting policies of the company that involve such management judgments are i the use of the retail method of accounting for inventory  ii the use of estimates of incurred but not reported claims for uninsured damages for personal injuries  for self insured workers compensation benefits and for benefits under the company s self insured medical  dental and prescription plans for its associates and future development costs of reported claims ibnr claims and iii the treatment of tax benefits from the company s net deferred tax asset 
inventory the margins at which the company s inventories can be sold are central to its business 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company utilizes the retail method  under which a cost to price relationship is developed on the basis of original cost as compared to initial retail selling price 
the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting margins are calculated by applying this cost to price relationship to the retail value of inventories 
permanent markdowns  when taken  reduce both the cost and price components of inventory on hand  which maintains the established cost to price relationship 
consequently  the use of the retail inventory method results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market 
inherent in the retail inventory method are management judgments and estimates on current and future selling value of the inventory which can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting margins 
the necessity for management estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can produce inventory costs at any point in time that are inexact 
further  deferred markdowns can result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
accordingly  at fiscal year end  management conducts a thorough review of inventory on hand and  based on its judgment  may reduce further the carrying cost of inventory by recording a mark down reserve for inventory with sales performance below expectations and or quantities in excess of expectations 
taking a year end reserve reduces the inventory recorded on the company s balance sheet and is charged against the company s cost of sales for the year just ended 
if inventories  net of reserves  were overestimated at the end of a year  assets and income for that year would be overstated and margins for the beginning of the next year would come in lower 
accordingly  inventory valuation is one of the company s important accounting matters 
the company s management believes that the inventory shown on the balance sheets at february  and february  included in the financial statements contained in this annual report this report were properly stated in all material respects subject to unforeseen i changes in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  ii changes in weather patterns  iii risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry  iv risks related to consumer acceptance of the company s products  and v war risks 
incurred but not reported claims for personal injuries and medical benefits in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company records a liability for ibnr claims for each fiscal year 
this liability is based on i a comparison between the dates claims were incurred in prior years and the dates they were paid  ii an analysis of the amounts previously paid  iii projections of inflation in medical costs and iv advice from time to time from its insurance broker with respect to damages for personal injuries and for workers compensation benefits and from an insurance consultant with respect to its benefit plans for associates 
the company has insurance policies with coverage for personal injury claims but it remains liable for a self insured retention 
the company is self insured for most workers compensation benefits and for its medical  dental and prescription plans for associates but it has stop loss insurance policies to limit its liability 
if the outcome of claims subsequently made with respect to a fiscal year were to exceed the ibnr liability for that year  the liabilities on the balance sheet would have been understated and income would have been overstated for the year in question 
accordingly  a well reasoned liability for ibnr claims reflected in the company s balance sheet is one of the company s important accounting matters 
the estimates underlying the liability for ibnr claims are matters of judgment on which insurance experts may differ 
the use of different estimates or assumptions would change the amount being recorded 
the company s management believes that the liability for ibnr claims reflected in the balance sheets at february  and february  included in the financial statements contained in this report were fairly stated in all material respects subject to the uncertainties of litigation and the risk of greater than anticipated inflation in medical costs 
realization of net deferred tax asset future realization of the tax benefits  which totaled million at february   attributable to the company s net deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in the pertinent tax jurisdictions within the carryback and or carryforward period available under the relevant tax law at the time of the tax deduction 
the state tax net operating loss carryforwards included in the company s net deferred tax asset are scheduled to expire in through management s assessment is that the company s net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or available carrybacks subject to i changes in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  ii the impact of competition and pricing  iii changes in weather patterns  iv risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry  v risks related to consumer acceptance of the company s products  and vi war risks 
in assessing the likelihood of future taxable income  management analyzes taxable income loss reported in recent years  current national retail industry sales trends and long term national economic trends 
management s assessment is most reliable with respect to the assets with expiration dates farthest in the future because of the longer time in which income can be earned to make the tax benefits from those assets available 
in the event new circumstances make the future realization of these tax benefits less likely than not  the asset will be written off and charged to income 
private label credit cards issued by the bank the company and world financial network national bank the bank are parties to a private label credit card program agreement  dated january  as amended  the credit card program agreement 
under the credit card program agreement the bank issues credit cards to company customers who apply to the bank 
net credit transaction volume with the bank was million in fiscal and million in fiscal customers must meet standards for creditworthiness set by the bank with the approval of the company  provided  however  that the bank shall take any actions required to prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices 
the credit cards issued by the bank are co branded with both the company s avenue r service mark and the bank s name 
the credit cards are used only for merchandise offered by the company 
credit card holders remit payments to the bank  generally by mailing personal checks 
the bank also handles all statement processing  payment processing  cardholder customer service and collections from delinquent cardholders 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company does not include the receivable asset created under the credit card program agreement in the company s accounts receivable on its balance sheets because the company has no interest in the customer accounts or receivables and  depending on the circumstances  might not purchase the accounts from the bank upon the expiration of the contractual term 
in this connection  it should be noted that the credit card program agreement states that i the bank is the sole and exclusive owner of all customer accounts  ii the company has no interest in the customer accounts and iii the bank is the creditor in respect of receivables defined in the credit card program agreement as amounts owed with respect to retail purchases  finance charges  deferred finance charges  other fees and charges for sales tax 
receivables as defined in the credit card program agreement were million at february  and million at february  also  when the credit card program agreement expires  currently scheduled for february   the company shall have the right to purchase the customer accounts from the bank for a price equal to the receivables and the bank shall have the right to require the company to purchase the customer accounts at that price if the company decides to commence a private label credit card program on its own or through another issuer of credit cards 
as to the company s income statements  general  administrative and store operating expenses were offset in part by premiums received from the bank of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the credit card program premium or discount reflected in general  administrative and store operating expenses is an amount equal to royalties paid to the company by the bank minus costs charged by the bank based on the volume of credit card program processing activities performed by the bank 
in fiscal  there was a material decline in royalties 
royalties are based on program revenues minus receivables written off by the bank and the cost of funds for the program  which  for up to the first million of receivables  means the one year constant maturities treasury cmt rate plus basis points to be reset every three months the published cmt rate was per annum at march  with the cmt rate not to be more than per annum and not to be less than per annum for the purpose of this calculation 
the bank s receivables for the program were less than million at february   but  if they grew larger than that amount  the cost of funds for the excess would be based primarily on the cost of borrowings of a trust for the purpose of securitizing receivables 
the decline in royalties from the bank in fiscal from fiscal was principally due to an increase in the rate of write offs by the bank of receivables  partially offset by a decrease in the cost of funds 
there is no assurance that the rate of write offs will not continue to increase or that the cost of funds will not begin to increase  either of which contingencies would reduce the amount of royalties 
store expansion the company leased stores at february   of which stores were in strip shopping centers  stores were in malls  stores were in downtown shopping districts and stores were in outlet malls 
total retail selling space was million square feet at february  and million square feet a year earlier 
in fiscal  the company opened new stores with an average of approximately  square feet of retail selling space and closed smaller stores 
substantially all the construction cost of new stores has been capitalized 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment were related principally to assets in stores and were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company has made commitments to lease and open approximately new stores during fiscal start up costs will be expensed but are not expected to have a material effect on general  administrative and store operating expenses

fulfillment of shop home sales is outsourced under a contract that will expire in august the company is adding a fulfillment operation at the company s national distribution center in troy  ohio 
there is no assurance of gross profit on shop home sales 
corporate acquisition reviews as a matter of routine  the company from time to time conducts due diligence reviews of businesses that are either for sale as a going concern or are in liquidation 
the company would consider making a bid on a suitable corporate acquisition at an opportune price if adequate financing at acceptable rates were available 
during the second quarter of fiscal  expenses associated with the submission of an unsuccessful bid to acquire the business of a competitor were approximately million and were included in general  administrative and store operating expenses 
tax matters the company s federal income tax returns for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were audited by the internal revenue service and settled except for the disallowance of a refund claim by the auditor 
the disallowance was affirmed by an irs appeals officer and is the subject of mediation 
the refund claim  which has not been recorded  would affect stockholders equity positively rather than increasing the company s earnings  if the disallowance were reversed or reduced in mediation
