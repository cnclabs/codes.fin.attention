quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity the company purchases cotton from approximately eleven established merchants with whom it has long standing relationships 
the majority of the company s purchases are executed using on call contracts 
these on call arrangements are used to insure that an adequate supply of cotton is available for the company s requirements 
under on call contracts  the company agrees to purchase specific quantities for delivery on specific dates  with pricing to be determined at a later time 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time of the company s election to fix specific contracts 
cotton on call with a fixed price at june  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and march at june   the company had unpriced contracts for deliveries between january and december based on the prevailing price at june   the value of these commitments are approximately million 
at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by delta apparel s fixed price contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the contracts 
at june   cotton on call with a fixed price was valued at million 
at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by delta apparel s fixed price contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the contracts 
the effect of a decline in the market price of cotton on delta apparel s fixed price contracts would have been less at june  than at june  because the value of delta apparel s fixed price cotton on call contracts was less on june  daily price fluctuations are minimal  yet long term trends in price movement could result in unfavorable pricing of cotton for delta apparel 
the company uses derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage its exposure to movements in commodity prices

accordingly  changes in the fair market value were marked to market

these cotton options resulted in a net gain of million for the company 
delta apparel does not currently own any other cotton options

if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at june  under the term loan had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness were increased by basis points  delta apparel s expense would have been approximately  or  higher for the fiscal year 
the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding
