item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of the company and related notes 
the company considers certain statements set forth herein to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  with respect to the company s expectations for future periods 
certain forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements related to the timing and success of acquisitions and the completion of development or redevelopment of properties  the financing of the company s operations  the ability to lease vacant space and the ability to renew or relet space under expiring leases  involve certain risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  the actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements and the company can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved 
certain factors that might cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements include  among other factors  general economic conditions  general real estate industry risks  tenant default and bankruptcies  loss of major tenants  the impact of competition and acquisition  redevelopment and development risks including delays in completion and cost overruns  the ability to finance business opportunities  increase in interest rates and local real estate markets 
consequently  such forward looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company s current operating and development plans and estimates 
these plans and estimates are subject to revisions from time to time as additional information becomes available  and actual results may differ from those indicated in the referenced statement 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment among other factors in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of similar businesses 
consolidation policy the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated financial position of the company and the operating partnership as of december  all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company owns an approximate partnership interest as sole general partner in the operating partnership  which provides the company with control over all significant activities of the operating partnership 
as per the agreement of limited partnership of cedar income fund partnership  lp dated june  the general partner has exclusive control over the business affairs of the operating partnership  including  without limitation  the following the making of any expenditures  the lending or borrowing of money  the assumption or guarantee of or any other contracting of indebtedness and other liabilities  the making of tax  regulatory and other filings  or rendering of periodic or other reports to governmental agencies  the acquisition  disposition  mortgage  pledge  encumbrance  hypothecation or exchange of any assets  the negotiation  execution and performance of any contracts  leases  conveyances or other instruments  the appointment of a manager or advisor to manage the business of the operating partnership  the maintenance of insurance  the formation of  or acquisition of an interest in  and the contribution of property to  any further limited or general partnerships  joint ventures or other relationships that it deems desirable  the control of all matters affecting the rights and obligations of the operating partnership  and the general partner may not be removed by the limited partners  with or without cause  except with the consent of the general partner 
based on the above nine items noted from the limited partnership agreement and the fact that the limited partners have no significant rights  the company has control over the operating partnership based on its general partnership interest  and  accordingly  the operating partnership is consolidated with the company in the accompanying financial statements as of december  the operating partnership in turn owns a general partnership interest in the point associates  lp which entity is also included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue recognition and accounts receivable rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due are included in deferred rents receivable on the company s balance sheets 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance and other operating expenses and real estate taxes 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
the company makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rent  tenant escalations and reimbursements and other revenue or income 
the company specifically analyzes tenant receivables and analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  when tenants are in bankruptcy  the company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition administrative and damage claims 
in some cases  the ultimate resolution of those claims may extend beyond a year 
such estimates may have a direct impact on the company s net income  as a greater bad debt reserve will result in less net income 
sales of real estate are recorded when title is conveyed to the buyer  subject to the buyer s financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale 
real estate land  buildings and improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
tenant improvements  which are included in buildings and improvements  are also stated at cost 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful life of ten to forty years for buildings and improvements  and five to ten years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
tenant improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purpose of determining the amounts of depreciation to be reflected on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
assessments by the company of certain other lease related costs as well as any recorded straight line rent receivable must be made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant will not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties and other investments 
any assessment resulting in a determination of impairment will have a direct negative impact on the company s net income

the leasing time table  between getting a lease signed  building out the space and the tenant taking possession  varies depending on the market in the geographic location of the property as well as the nature of the tenant s business 
management estimates that the company will incur approximately  in tenant improvement and leasing costs to lease up vacancies during such amounts have been included in the respective properties operating budgets

the fort washington development is expected to be financed with a third party construction loan  which  upon completion of construction  will become a permanent loan  of million the aggregate term of the loan including the construction period will be five years  third party participating equity of million  approximately million from the tenant and approximately  in equity contributions from the company out of currently available cash 
the supermarket anchored center is expected to be acquired by assumption of existing third party financing of approximately million  million from a third party participating equity co venturer  and million from the company s currently available cash 
the sole general partnership interest will be purchased in four equal annual installments of approximately  each  again from currently available cash 
the company s indebtedness at december  was approximately million  including million in financing payable to swh 
the swh financing requires a million payment to be made as of november   among other required payments 
the company expects to fund the two mandatory payments due with respect to the swh financing  and  due by november and may  respectively from a combination of i net proceeds of the currently pending sale of the southpoint property  ii million in cash and cash equivalents presently on hand  iii drawdowns on a million line of credit iv net proceeds of sales of partial interests in one or more of the company s other properties and v net proceeds of the pending refinancing of the point s mortgage loan 
the operating partnership obtained a line of credit  effective march   in the amount of  from north fork bank  melville  new york 
the term of the loan is for one year with a maturity date of march  the loan  at the sole discretion of the bank  may be used for i real estate investment  ii real estate management  iii working capital and iv other purposes as applicable and as approved by the bank 
the interest rate is the greater of or the bank s prime rate plus 
interest on the outstanding loan balance is to be paid to the bank monthly in arrears 
the line of credit s availability is subject to certain conditions  including  but not limited to  quarterly submission of q filings  annual submission of k filings and a day annual clean up ie the outstanding balance of drawdowns under the line of credit must be reduced to zero for days 
the line of credit does not require any fees to be paid by the company or the operating partnership 
the company views the availability of this line of credit to be sound business practice and an augment to its liquidity 
the company expects that capital markets in the united states will continue to be active and will provide funds for the refinancing of its four retail properties first mortgages as such mortgages mature over the next months to years 
with the exception of the point s mortgage  all such mortgages are amortizing loans 
the balances due at maturity  and the annual amortization payments due are summarized below 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company believes that its liquidity and expected sources of future cash  including the i net proceeds from the currently pending sale of southpoint as further discussed below  ii million of cash and cash equivalents presently on hand  iii drawdowns on a million line of credit  iv net proceeds of sales of partial interests in one or more of the company s other properties  and v net proceeds of the pending refinancing of the point s mortgage loan are sufficient to meet current and short term obligations  which include capital expenditures  property acquisition commitments  swh amortization payments and repayment of the point s existing mortgage loan 
the tragedy of september  had a significant effect on the real estate industry 
the real estate industry has been experiencing a significant change in the property insurance markets that has resulted in significantly higher premiums for landlords whose policies are subject to renewal in  primarily in the area of terrorism insurance coverage 
the company does not know if sufficient insurance coverage will be available when the current policy expires  or the costs for obtaining a policy containing terms similar to our current policy 
this may have an impact on the availability and cost of secured financing in the future 
also  the company expects  as a result of investigations of enron and other reported investigations of financial reporting  that insurance coverage and premium costs for officers and directors insurance will be adversely affected 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table sets forth the company s significant debt obligations at december  by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date the combined aggregate future principal payments of mortgages and loans at december  are as follows year mortgage loan payable other loan payable thereafter  the point s million loan has two six month extensions through june  the company expects to refinance the point in an amount equal to or greater than million on or before june  substantially all of amount due is expected to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of southpoint see note 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to make distributions to its stockholders of at least of reit taxable income 
the company expects to use its cash on hand and cash flow from operating activities for this purpose if distributions to partners and stockholders are required in order to continue to qualify as a reit 
inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past several years have favorably impacted the company s operations by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation had the indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
the company s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
these factors  in the long run  are expected to result in more attractive returns from the company s real estate portfolio as compared to short term investment vehicles 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measurement of performance of the reit 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sale of properties plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity see selected financial data 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table represents the company s ffo calculation for the years ended december  net loss before limited partner s interest in operating partnership    add less limited partner s interest in operating partnership    net income available to common shareholders    adjustment for funds from operations add less company s share of the following items depreciation    impairment loss   loss on sale of real estate  minority interest   gain on sale of real estate   amount distributable to minority partners upon consolidation  basic and diluted funds from operations    weighted average shares units outstanding    the following table represents the operating partnership s ffo calculation for the years ended december  net loss before limited partner s interest in operating partnership    add less limited partner s interest in operating partnership    net loss income available to common shareholders    adjustment for funds from operations add less company s share of the following items limited partner s interest    depreciation    loss on sale of real estate  impairment loss   minority interest   gain on sale of real estate   amount distributable to minority partners upon consolidation  basic and diluted funds from operations    weighted average shares units outstanding    assumes conversion of limited partnership units of the operating partnership  reflects the issuance of  new shares of common stock on november   and the repurchase of  shares of common stock on november   and the repurchase of  shares of common stock on december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its floating debt arrangements 
the company s primary strategy is to protect against this risk by using a derivative transaction to limit the adverse impact that floating libor rate interest fluctuations could have on cash flow 
in november  the company  through a partnership it controls  entered into an interest rate cap agreement effective december  with a financial institution for a notional amount of  capping the interest rate of its secured mortgage loan facility which provides for interest at libor plus interest rate at december  was 
the cap limits interest to and expires on june  the intention is for the cap agreement to be held to maturity 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   the hedge effectively had no value and has been adjusted in accordance with sfas see note  recent pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements 
because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management s adoption of sfas see note  recent pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements did not have a significant effect on earnings or on the financial position of the company 
if the base interest rates would increase by  there would be an approximate  decrease in net income prior to minority interest and limited partner s interest 
in addition  the company has an aggregate of  of mortgage loans and one other loan payable at fixed interest rates 
a substantial increase in general interest rates would potentially prevent the company from refinancing the mortgage loans and the other loan at rates favorable to the company
