item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our primary business is the manufacturing and marketing of plastic films for use in the packaging  transportation  beverage  food  automotive  pharmaceutical  chemical  electronics  construction  agricultural and textile industries 
we currently have manufacturing operations located in countries in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
we manufacture plastic films principally from resins blended with other raw materials 
we may either sell the film or further process it by metallizing  printing  laminating  slitting or converting it 
our processing technologies enable us to create a variety of value added products according to the specifications of our customers 
resin costs generally constitute approximately of the cost of goods sold 
since resin costs typically fluctuate  selling prices are generally determined as a spread over resin costs  usually expressed as cents per pound 
accordingly  costs and profits are most often expressed in cents per pound  and  with certain exceptions  the historical increases and decreases in resin costs have generally been reflected over a period of time in the sales prices of the products on a penny for penny basis 
assuming a constant volume of sales  an increase in resin costs should therefore result in increased sales revenues but lower gross profit as a percentage of sales or gross profit margin  while a decrease in resin costs should result in lower sales revenues with higher gross profit margins

our principal uses of cash have been to fund working capital  including operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures 
our working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october  this increase of million in working capital is primarily attributable to the refinancing of our credit facility in november which reduced our current debt payable by million 
in addition  marking our derivatives to market in accordance with fasb resulted in an unrealized gain of  on our derivative financial instruments held by us in other current assets at october  these increases were offset by net reductions in our accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
the remaining increases and decreases in components of our financial position reflect the reduced selling prices and lower raw material costs associated with the operating activity for fiscal on october   we entered into the credit agreement with the morgan guaranty trust company  as agent 
the credit agreement provided us with two credit facilities  consisting of a long term credit facility in the amount of million and a revolving credit facility currently for an amount up to million 
as of october   there was million outstanding under the term credit facility 
at october   there was a standby letter of credit in the amount of million held as security against the pennsylvania industrial loan due on february   thereby reducing the revolving credit facility availability to million 
there were no additional borrowings under this revolving credit facility at october  on april   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement the amendment 
the principal effects of the amendment relate to certain changes in the financial ratios contained in the credit agreement  the change of the interest rate applicable to the credit agreement and the granting of security interests in our accounts receivables and inventory located in north america and in of our equity interest in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the interest rate margins which determine the interest rates applicable to the loans under the credit agreement increased as follows the margin applicable to base rate loans formerly to 
increased to a range from 
to and the margin applicable to libor rate loans formerly 
to increased to a range from to the credit agreement  as amended  contained financial covenants  the most significant of which are a cash flow ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
for the period from august   through october   the cash flow ratio may not exceed for the period from august   through october   the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than the indenture pursuant to which we issued million of senior subordinated notes contains customary covenants including limitations on the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets and the making of restricted payments 
we are currently in compliance with all of these covenants  and do not foresee any problems in remaining in compliance with these covenants 
on november   we entered into a loan and security agreement with congress financial corporation  as agent  and the financial institutions named in the agreement  as lenders 
under this new credit facility the lenders provided a maximum credit facility of million  including a letter of credit facility of up to million 
amounts available for borrowing are based upon the sum of eligible domestic values of building and equipment at closing date and eligible accounts receivable and inventories on a monthly basis 
the new credit facility is secured by mortgages and liens on our domestic assets and in of our equity interest in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the agreement contains customary covenants including limitations on the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets  the making of restricted payments  and minimum ebitda requirements if the loan s excess availability is less than million 
at the closing  the company borrowed the sum of million  of which million was used to pay off and terminate the existing term loan and revolving credit facility 
rates under the new facility are comparable to those under the prior facility 
we maintain various unsecured short term credit facilities at some of our foreign subsidiaries 
at october   the aggregate amount outstanding under such facilities was million  and million was available for borrowing 
borrowings from these facilities are used to support operations at such subsidiaries and are generally serviced by cash flow from operations 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at october   as compared to million at october  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended october   was million  consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of million  reduction of trade accounts receivable by million  decrease in inventories on hand by million  increase in accrued expenses of million and a non cash loss on the sale of our interest in the hitachi filtec joint venture of million 
these activities were partially offset by the net loss for the period of million  reduction of trade accounts payable of million  net gains on sale of property  plant and equipment of million and net increases in other operating assets and liabilities of million 
in each period  the net decreases in other operating assets and liabilities reflect normal operating activity 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended october   which resulted primarily from our net investment in capital expenditures of million  offset by net proceeds from the sale of the company s investment in hitachi filtec joint venture of million and sales of property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  reflecting net repayments of million on available credit facilities partially offset by proceeds from stock issuances of million 
the remaining increases and decreases in the components of our financial position reflect normal operating activity 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  combined with the availability of funds under the new credit facility and credit lines available to our foreign subsidiaries for local currency borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
these standards establish requirements for reporting and accounting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations and no 
 intangible assets 
these standards require business combinations to be accounted for as purchases  broaden the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill and requires the use of a non amortization approach for purchased goodwill and certain intangible assets 
under the non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangible assets will not be amortized in the results of operations  but will be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
this standard is effective no later than the company s fiscal year beginning november   but may be adopted on november  the company has elected to adopt this standard on november  the company has recorded   and  of goodwill amortization expense net of related tax benefit for the years ended october   and  respectively 
the company has not completed its fair market valuations of the reporting units  but does not expect that any goodwill will be impaired 
on october   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  although it retains the impairment testing methodology used in sfas no 
the accounting and reporting provisions of apbo no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  are superceded by sfas no 
 except that the statement preserves the requirement of apbo no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
the statement covers a variety of implementation issues inherent in sfas no 
 unifies the framework used in accounting for assets to be disposed of and discontinued operations  and broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas no 
on november  the company does not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material impact on its results of operations
