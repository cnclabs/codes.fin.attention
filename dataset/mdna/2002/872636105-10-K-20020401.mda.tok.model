critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses trm corporation s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to customer bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
trm maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of trm s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
trm writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company is partially self insured for purposes of providing medical insurance benefits to its employees 
the company records estimated reserves equal to approximately months of historical expense after consideration of historical trends  known or reasonably estimated expenses  and aggregate stop loss coverages provided by its insurance carrier 
should actual expenses be greater than estimated  additional expense related to medical insurance claims may be recorded 
trm records a reserve for cash losses in its atm network resulting from theft and vandalism 
these estimates are based upon historical losses as well as insurance coverage limitations 
should actual occurrences of theft result in greater losses than anticipated  additional expense related to actual losses may be recorded 
trm s use of the units of production method of depreciation on a portion of its photocopier assets requires the use of estimates related to the useful life of such assets 
trm has determined that the useful life of these assets is an average of  copies per machine 
if actual copies produced differ significantly from estimated useful life at the time of asset disposal  further write downs equal to the remaining carrying value may be required 
if future losses on disposal of this class of photocopiers becomes evidence of a shorter useful life than originally estimated  a change is accounting estimate relating to depreciable life may be required resulting in additional depreciation charges on a prospective basis 
trm holds a minority interest in a french entity having operations or technology in areas within or adjacent to its strategic focus  which is a non publicly traded company whose value is difficult to determine 
trm records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
trm records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while trm has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event trm was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should trm determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
fas is effective for transfer and servicing transactions occurring after march  it was effective for disclosures about securitizations and collateral and for the recognition and reclassification of collateral for fiscal years ending after december  adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

sfas  business combinations  and no

 business combination 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas also requires that upon adoption of sfas the company reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas in its first quarter ended march  the company is in the process of preparing for its adoption of sfas and is making the determinations as to what its reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  the company will no longer record  of amortization relating to its existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
also  as a result of the company disposing of its interest in iatmglobal 
net in february  the goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles recognized as of december  will be eliminated from the company s consolidated financial statements see item  matters affecting analysis 
in preparation for the adoption of fas  the company is in the process of evaluating the useful lives of its existing other intangible assets and anticipates that any changes in the useful lives will not have a material impact on the results of its operations 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
due to the sale of the company s interest in iatmglobal 
net in february  all goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles currently recognized will be eliminated and thus it will not be necessary to perform the impairment test 
in june  fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fasb statement no 
is effective for the fiscal years beginning after june  fasb statement no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
fasb statement no 
requires that the fair value of liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the impact of this pronouncement on the company s financial statements is not expected to be material 
in august of  fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fasb issued statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
fasb statement no 
did not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under apb opinion no 
 accordingly two accounting models existed for long lived assets to be disposed of 
fasb statement no 
establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in statement no 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
in addition  fasb statement no 
resolves significant implementation issues related to statement no 
the company is in the process of assessing the impact of sfas on the financial statements 
disclosure regarding euro conversion on january   eleven member countries of the european community began a process to convert their existing sovereign currencies to a single common denomination  the euro 
the process of conversion is gradual over the next three years  culminating in the eventual removal from circulation of all existing domestic currency for the participating countries 
as of december  the company presently operates in the united kingdom and transacts business in the local currency of that country 
the united kingdom may become subject to the conversion 
the company believes that it is accommodating the conversion to the euro without a material impact on its financial statements
