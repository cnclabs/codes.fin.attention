general since the reorganization in june  management of prolong has concentrated a significant portion of its efforts and resources on the marketing and sale of prolong s consumer oriented products  through traditional retail distribution and through direct response television advertising 
management now believes that it has attained a significant level of brand and product identification and prolong has now begun efforts to expand sales of its consumer lubrication products into commercial and industrial channels  as well as international markets 
the lubricant business is extremely competitive 
prolong s business requires that it compete with larger  better financed entities  most of which have brand names which are well established in the marketplace 
although prolong  in the opinion of management  has unique products which have superior performance characteristics relative to the well known products available in the marketplace  prolong remains at a distinct disadvantage and will be required to expend substantial sums in order to promote brand name identity and product acceptance among its prospective customers 
in order to establish brand name identity  prolong has relied primarily on its direct response television programs and intends from time to time to utilize this means to gain product recognition for purposes of directly increasing sales as well as increasing retail  commercial and industrial and governmental sales resulting from broader public knowledge of its products

factors which may affect future operating results in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the statements contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties which may affect  among other things  our ability to maintain our current sales rate or may cause sales to decline 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following 
competitive  technological  financial and business challenges may make it more difficult for us to continue to sell specialty lubricant and appearance products 

we may be unable to retain our existing key sales  technical and management personnel 

increased competition in the specialized lubrication or appearance product markets may cause downward pressure on our prices 
o we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
o the lubricant or appearance products industries or our operations or business may face other unforeseen material adversechanges 

we may be unable to generate either through operations  debt placements or equity sales  sufficient cash to operate the business profitably 
our current expectations  which impact our budgeting  marketing  and other management decisions  are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments 
revisions to our current expectations may cause us to change our marketing  capital expenditures or other budgets  which may in turn affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
although we believe that our current expectations are reasonable  we make no representation regarding their accuracy 
therefore  you should avoid placing undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future we expect that our need for additional funds will increase in the future as our business grows 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain adequate funds when we need them or on acceptable terms  if at all 
our future need for additional funds will depend on numerous factors including the following 
the success of our product development programs 

the commercial success of our products 

the rate of growth of our business 

the availability of cash from our operations and other sources 
we are currently seeking additional funds through public or private sales of our stock or through borrowing 
the issuance of additional shares of stock could result in a substantial dilution to the ownership interests of our present or future stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may need to page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries delay or scale back our product development and the manufacture of our current products 
any inability to obtain funds when we need them would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are currently seeking a new credit facility we have a credit facility with a financial institution that allows us to borrow the greater of million  or eligible accounts receivable and inventories as defined 
as of december   we were in violation of certain financial debt covenants  and as a result we are currently paying interest at the institution s default rate 
management is presently discussing remedies with the financial institution regarding the covenant violations  and is actively pursuing a replacement senior secured lender with additional subordinated debt 
there is no guarantee that the company will be able to secure a new credit facility at terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
further  there is no guarantee that our current lender will not pursue the remedies available to it as the result of our covenant violations 
we depend on our key management personnel we depend on our key management personnel and our future success will depend in large part upon their contributions  experience and expertise 
we have entered into employment agreements with of our senior executives for periods ranging from to years 
in addition  our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel 
the loss of any key management personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business is subject to the risk of product liability claims the nature of our business exposes us to risk from product liability claims 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with maximum coverage limits of  for each occurrence and an aggregate limit of  per year 
product liability coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and we cannot guarantee that our current coverage will adequately cover future product liability claims 
currently  we have no plans to increase our coverage 
however  we will reevaluate our product liability coverage from time to time in the future 
any losses that we may suffer from future liability claims  including the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon our reputation and marketability of our products  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the market in which we operate is highly competitive the current market for our products is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
our principal competitors include other providers of specialized lubrication products  such as the clorox company stp tm and pennzoil quaker state corporation slick tm  both of which market engine treatments 
other competitive engine treatment brands include duralube r and z max tm 
our competitors also include major oil brands such as shell  chevron  castrol  and other companies that manufacture lubrication products  such as wd company 
further  we believe that major oil companies  well established consumer products and new start up companies not presently offering products that compete directly with our products  may enter our markets in the future 
with respect to our appearance products  major competitors include such companies as turtle wax  inc  meguiar s  inc  mothers  pennzoil quaker state company  and the clorox company 
increased competition could result in any or all of the following  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
price reductions 
reduced gross margins 
loss of market share 
loss of shelf space page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries in addition  many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources and greater market recognition than we do 
several of our competitors also have  or may develop or acquire  substantial customer bases in the automotive and other related industries 
as a result  our competitors may respond quicker to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote more resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
additionally  other dealers and distributors may appeal to the price sensitive segment of the market by offering similar lubrication and appearance products at prices below ours 
while we believe that our prices are competitive for the level of quality of our products  we rely on our brand name recognition and reputation for selling quality products supported by strong customer service 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures that we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the prices of many of our components are highly volatile we depend upon our suppliers to provide us with the primary components for our afmt formula 
the price of such components is extremely volatile and beyond our control or influence 
prices for the quality of components we desire depend on the origin  supply and demand at the time of purchase 
component prices typically depend on multiple factors within the producing countries  including weather and political and economic conditions 
additionally  petroleum products  which form our afmt formula  have been affected in the past  and may be affected in the future  by the actions of certain organizations and associations  such as the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  that have historically attempted to control prices of petroleum products through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting petroleum supplies worldwide 
we cannot guarantee that opec or others will be unsuccessful in raising the prices of petroleum components or that  if prices increase  we will be able or choose to maintain our gross margins by raising our prices without affecting demand 
increases in component prices  for whatever reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have operated as an independent company only since we have only been an independent operating company since june prior to such time  our company was essentially dormant for approximately years  with few assets or operations 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully continue our growth through the expansion of our operations  by accessing new markets or otherwise 
from the reorganization through december  we generated revenues of approximately  and operating losses of approximately  from december through december  our operations have generated net income 
in   and we suffered net losses of approximately   and  we cannot guarantee our operating success and ability to generate net income in the future 
we depend on third party suppliers to date  we have succeeded in obtaining enough components from existing suppliers to produce our afmt formula in order to meet our current manufacturing needs 
we also believe that adequate supplies will continue to be available in the near future 
while we continue to work actively with each supplier in order to sustain and at times increase production of our components  we cannot guarantee that each supplier will be able to sustain or increase its production in time to satisfy our demand or that alternate suppliers will be able to meet any supply deficiency 
if we fail to obtain enough components  or if such components fall below our quality standards  shipments and sales of our products may be delayed or reduced 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries most of our revenue comes from a limited number of products we currently generate substantially all of our revenues from sales of our afmt based products and we expect this trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
because our revenues are concentrated in lubricant products  a decline in the demand for  or in the prices of  our afmt based products as a result of competition  technological advances or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and operating results 
we recently contracted our appearance product line to a limited product mix and at this time we plan to maintain that strategy 
a significant portion of our revenues currently comes from a small number of customers  and any decrease in revenue from these customers could harm our results of operations a significant portion of our revenues comes from only a small number of customers 
for example  during fiscal year  four customers accounted for approximately of net revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to depend on sales to a small number of customers 
any downturn in the business from these customers could seriously harm our revenues and results of operations 
our average selling prices may decline the average sales prices for our products may decline 
recently  competitors and consumers have pressured specialty lubricant suppliers to reduce pricing  which in turn could result in downward pricing pressure on our products 
in addition  our average sales prices decline when we negotiate large volume price discounts with certain customers 
in the short term  we plan to work at lowering our manufacturing costs in order to offset the possibility of declining average sales prices 
in the long term  we plan to develop new afmt based products and product mixes that can be manufactured at lower cost or sold at higher average sales prices 
if  however  we fail to achieve such manufacturing cost reductions or diversify our product mix  our gross margins could decline 
such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we depend on international sales for future growth and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets international sales comprised of revenues in as compared to of revenues in we plan to expand international sales in the future 
this will require significant financial resources and management attention 
in order to expand sales internationally  we plan to do the following 
establish additional marketing and sales operations 

recruit additional international distributors 

investment in international protection of our trademarks 
to the extent we fail to do any of the above  our growth may suffer and our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we run the risk that revenues from our expanding international operations will be taxed by foreign authorities at rates higher than our domestic tax rates 
currently  our worldwide sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would make our products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
additional risks inherent in our worldwide business activities include 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers 

costs of localizing products in foreign countries 

longer accounts receivable collection cycles 

difficulties in managing foreign operations 

potential for adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating our earnings 

the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries 
currency crisis in foreign countries that interrupt or terminate the ability of our international customers to settle their accounts in us dollars

our business is subject to the risk of litigation we are subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of our business 
such claims or litigation  or other claims or litigation  could result in a decision that is adverse to us 
a decision adverse to us in this or any other matter could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  litigation  regardless of its merits  could result in substantial costs to us and divert management s attention from our operations see legal proceedings we could be subject to environmental liabilities or regulatory compliance costs federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances we use in the manufacture of our products and on our facilities 
we have registered our fuel conditioners with the united states environmental protection agency epa 
such epa registrations have no term but require us to notify the epa of any changes in the chemical composition of such conditioners or other information contained in such registration 
we are unaware of any additional governmental approvals required for our products 
we are also unaware of any existing or probable governmental regulations which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we do not manufacture or store significant quantities of our products  any direct costs incurred in complying with environmental laws have been minimal and have not materially affected our business 
we have tried to minimize our economic risk from environmental violations by our manufacturers or bottlers by locating alternative sources of such services 
we believe that our activities and those of our contract manufacturers conform to present governmental regulations that apply to each such entities operations 
additionally  we believe that our current facilities conform to present governmental regulations relating to environmental  land use  public utility utilization and fire code matters 
government regulations could be changed to impose additional requirements on us which could restrict our ability to expand our operations or have an adverse effect on our business 
the adoption of these types of governmental regulations or our failure to comply with the applicable environmental and land use regulations or restrictions on the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liability or could cause our operations or those of our contract manufacturers to be curtailed  relocated or suspended 
we are controlled by management and certain stockholders as of march   our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders collectively held approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the election of our directors and most other stockholders actions and  as a result  can direct our business affairs 
such concentration of voting power could delay or prevent our company from taking certain actions including  but not limited to  a change in our company s control 
issuances of our preferred stock may effect the price of our common stock our board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock 
such issuances could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
issuing preferred stock provides flexibility with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
however  an issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our voting stock and this may not be in the best interests of some of our stockholders 
we do not currently plan to issue any shares of our preferred page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries stock 
however  we cannot guarantee that the issuance of shares of our preferred stock will not have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock in the future 
our common stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
these fluctuations could continue 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are 
quarterly variations in our operating results  
changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  
speculation in the press or investment community  
strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as new product announcements  acquisitions or restructuring  
actions by institutional stockholders  
general market conditions  and 
domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general have experienced high volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock
