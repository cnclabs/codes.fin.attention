item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview we are a non diversified investment company that is regulated as a business development company under the investment company act of we provide equity and long term debt financing to small and medium sized private companies in a variety of industries throughout the united states 
in addition  we invest a portion of our assets in small capitalization public companies 
our investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation in the value of our investments and to provide current income primarily from interest  dividends and fees paid by our portfolio companies 
historically  we have focused our investing activities on private equity securities 
we generally structure our private equity investments as participating preferred stock with an to dividend yield that accumulates and is paid upon a liquidity event 
our private equity investments typically range from million to million  and we generally expect these investments to achieve liquidity within three to five years 
we typically do not receive a cash return on our private equity investments until a liquidity event occurs  but instead seek to achieve long term capital appreciation in net asset value through such investments 
in the past year we have explored various strategic alternatives to enhance our growth and stockholders value 
we determined that operating at our current size or attempting to realize premature liquidity events within our portfolio would not enhance the market value of our common stock and would limit our ability to generate recurring income sought by the investment community and our stockholders 
specifically  we have been exploring the possibility of expanding our origination of mezzanine investments 
shares of business development companies that invest primarily in mezzanine investments tend to trade at a premium to net asset value per share due to the expectation of current income produced by such investments 
we believe that current market conditions  influenced by more stringent credit standards of commercial banks and more conservative capital structures sought by entrepreneurs and equity sponsors  have created an increased demand for mezzanine investments 
mezzanine investments would be expected to provide a current cash return to us in the form of interest and origination fees 
we typically participate in any increase in the equity value of the companies to whom we provide mezzanine financing through warrants or other equity rights 
we anticipate that mezzanine investments would provide less potential for appreciation in our net asset value than private equity investments  but would 
table of contents instead provide higher current income that may be distributed to our stockholders 
in the future  we may also seek to further leverage our portfolio by utilizing additional borrowings to fund our investments 
in order to fund the origination of mezzanine investments  we are exploring various capital raising alternatives 
we intend to use the proceeds of such an event to make mezzanine investments 
we can make no assurances that a capital raising effort will be undertaken or that any of our portfolio companies would experience a liquidity event 
we can also make no assurances that our plan to expand our origination of mezzanine investments will be consummated or be successful 
certain accounting policies privately placed equity and mezzanine securities are carried at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
initially  the fair value of each such security is based upon its original cost 
cost is also the primary factor used to determine fair value on an ongoing basis until significant developments or other factors affecting the investment such as results of subsequent financings  the availability of market quotations  the portfolio company s operations and changes in general market conditions provide a basis for value other than cost 
portfolio investments listed on a securities exchange or traded on the nasdaq stock market are valued at the closing price listed on the relevant exchange or quotation system on the date of valuation 
securities traded in the over the counter market are valued based on the average of the closing bid and asked prices on the date of valuation 
origination fees are recognized as income during the period in which they are received 
interest income is recorded on mezzanine investments when the payment is contractually due unless a loan is more than days past due 
interest is not accrued on any loans that are more than days past due 
we account for our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance is captioned net change in net assets resulting from operations  which is the sum of two elements 
the first element is investment income loss  net  which is the difference between our income from interest  dividends and fees  and our operating expenses 
the second element is net gain loss on investments  which is the sum of the difference between the proceeds received from our dispositions of portfolio securities and their stated cost net realized gain loss on investments  and the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio net unrealized gain loss on investments 
net realized gain loss on investments and net unrealized gain loss on investments are directly related 
for example  in the period during which a security is sold to realize a gain  net unrealized gain on investments decreases  and net realized gain on investments increases 
historically  we have focused our investing activities on private equity securities 
we began making such investments in and are now entering into a phase of the business plan which emphasizes positioning our more mature portfolio companies for appropriate liquidity events 
as a result  we are continuously monitoring portfolio company results and evaluating opportunities to maximize the valuation of our investments 
in that regard  we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions  financing transactions  initial public offerings  strategic alliances  and sale opportunities involving our portfolio companies 
any such transaction could have an impact on the valuation of our investments 
these transactions and activities are generally not disclosed to our stockholders and the investing public until such time as the transactions are publicly announced or completed  as the case may be 
results of operations dividend and interest income dividend and interest income on investments for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the reduction in interest and dividend income during the 
table of contents year ended december  was primarily due to the reduction in both cash available for short term investing and the related short term interest rates 
operating expenses total operating expenses during the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the significant component of total operating expenses was advisory fees of   and  earned by our investment adviser during the years ended december   and  respectively 
net realized and unrealized gains on investment transactions during the years ended december   and  valuation of our equity and mezzanine investments resulted in net realized and unrealized gains on investments of   and  respectively 
at december   and  we had investments in twelve and ten privately held companies  respectively  as well as in various small capitalization public stocks which are subject to general stock market and business conditions 
the unrealized gains during such periods were significantly influenced by general stock market and business conditions  as well as the december  and august  revaluations of flight options international  inc financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december  and  we had  and  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents which were primarily invested in united states treasury securities 
restricted cash is held under direction of the lender and is not readily available to fund investments or pay operating expenses 
our management believes that our cash and cash equivalents  together with proceeds from our investments  will provide us with the liquidity necessary to pay our operating expenses and make follow on investments 
however  in order to execute our mezzanine investment plan  we will continue to seek opportunities to raise additional capital 
at december  and  we had stockholders equity of  and  respectively  resulting in a net asset value per share of and  respectively 
at december   we had  of outstanding indebtedness 
for the year ended december   the weighted average interest rate on this indebtedness was 
brantley venture partners ii  lp  brantley venture partners iii  lp and brantley partners iv  lp hold  in the aggregate  approximately million of private equity investments 
these partnerships are related to our investment adviser in a manner that required the receipt  from the securities and exchange commission  of an exemption from certain provisions of the investment company act of in order to permit us  under certain circumstances  to invest in the same portfolio companies as the other private investment funds managed by our investment adviser 
consistent with our current long term objectives  our board of directors has recently asked our investment adviser to consider ways to maximize stockholder value in the event that our net asset value has not appreciated by a minimum of per annum for the seven year period ending december  such actions could include  but are not limited to  a possible recommendation to consider the sale of some or all of our investments 
our management has been pleased with the performance of our portfolio companies since inception and believes that liquidity opportunities that generally start presenting themselves several years into a portfolio of this nature may create gains for us over the next few years 
our portfolio is just beginning to enter a period of possible liquidity events 
however  in light of the market price of our common stock relative to its net asset value  our management has reiterated our planned goals and objectives and has reassured our stockholders that our management intends to take action if those goals and objectives are not met 
nevertheless  our management expects to meet our net asset value appreciation target 
at december  and december   the aggregate cost of the investments we made to date was million and million  respectively  and their aggregate market value was million and million  respectively  for an aggregate fair value appreciation of and  respectively 
our 
table of contents management believes that our portfolio companies have significant potential for long term growth in sales and earnings 
since the completion of our initial public offering  our management has focused its investment activities on securing new investments for our portfolio 
however  given the nature of our current portfolio and the fact that this portfolio as a whole is maturing  our management is seeking to position the more mature portfolio companies for appropriate liquidity events 
we are continuously monitoring portfolio company results and evaluating opportunities to maximize the value of our investments 
in that regard  we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions  financing transactions  initial public offerings  strategic alliances and sale opportunities involving our portfolio companies 
these transactions and activities are generally not disclosed to our stockholders and the investing public until such time as the transactions are publicly announced or completed  as the case may be 
any such transaction could have an impact on the valuation of our investments 
however  these revised valuations would generally not be adjusted until the transaction is publicly announced or completed 
we intend to expand our origination of mezzanine investments 
thus  as we invest the net proceeds from future portfolio company liquidity events or the issuance of additional capital  we expect that mezzanine investments will represent a much larger percentage of our assets 
the mezzanine investments are expected to provide a current cash return to us in the form of interest and origination fees 
although we will typically participate in any increase in the equity value of the companies to whom we provide mezzanine financing through warrants or other equity rights  we anticipate that our mezzanine investments will provide less potential for appreciation in our net asset value than our private equity investments  but will instead provide higher current income that may be distributed to our stockholders 
pending investment  we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in cash equivalents  government securities or high quality debt securities maturing within one year or less from the time of investment 
the investment income generated from such cash equivalents is expected to be less than the current income we anticipate from mezzanine investments

our investments often include securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale that adversely affect the liquidity and marketability of such securities 
as a result  we are subject to risk of loss which may prevent our stockholders from achieving price appreciation and dividend distributions 
the portion of our portfolio consisting of investments in private companies is also subject to valuation risk 
we value our privately held investments based on a determination of their fair value made in good faith by our board of directors on a quarterly basis in accordance with our established guidelines 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated values of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would exist if a ready market for these securities existed 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net unrealized gain loss on investments 
we consider the management of equity price risk essential to conducting our business and maintaining our profitability 
a portion of our portfolio consists of investments in private companies 
we anticipate no impact on these investments from modest changes in public market equity prices 
however  should significant changes in market prices occur  there could be a long term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains realized on these investments

impact of inflation we do not believe that our business is materially affected by inflation  other than the impact that inflation may have on the securities markets  the valuations of business enterprises and the relationship of such valuations to underlying earnings  all of which will influence the value of our investments
