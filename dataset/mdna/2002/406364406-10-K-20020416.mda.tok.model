accounting for income taxes sfas no 

as a result of the fluctuations in the market value of the hrp limited partner units  the realization of a gain on the sale of hallwood energy  and the projected income from operations  partially offset by the decline in value of the company s hotel properties  management has determined that the deferred tax asset should be adjusted to reflect the impact of these changes on the anticipated utilization of nols resulting from the assumed realization of the gains and projected income from operations 
accordingly the company recorded a deferred tax expense of  in  and deferred tax benefits of  in and  in  respectively  which resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets of  at december    at december  and  at december  the company recorded a federal current charge of  in and  in  for the filing of separate returns of certain subsidiaries not included in the company s consolidated federal tax return  and a current charge of  for alternative minimum tax in the company recorded state tax expense of  in   in and  in the company s nols expire as follows    and to  sfas no 
requires that the tax benefit of such nols be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such nols to be more likely than not 
based upon the company s expectations and available tax planning strategies  management has determined that taxable income will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize approximately  of the nols prior to their ultimate expiration in the year management believes that the company has certain tax planning strategies available  which include the potential sale of certain real estate investments  that could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize the net recorded tax benefits before their expiration 
management has considered such strategies in reaching its conclusion that  more likely than not  taxable income will be sufficient to utilize a portion of the nols before expiration  however  future levels of operating income and taxable gains are dependent upon general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for utilization of the nols 
management periodically re evaluates its tax planning strategies based upon changes in facts and circumstances and  accordingly  considers potential adjustments to the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset 
although the use of such carryforwards could  under certain circumstances be limited  the company is presently unaware of the occurrence of any event which would result in such limitations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition fee income from real estate operations is recognized as the services eg management  leasing  acquisition  construction are performed in accordance with various service agreements 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title passes to the customer 
impairment of long lived assets the company s management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported

all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recorded in other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings
