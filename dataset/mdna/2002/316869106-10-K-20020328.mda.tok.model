item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition a nd results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements with in the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  and is subject to the safe harb ors created by those sections 
these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertaintie s that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that may be anticipated by such forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to revis e or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the risk factors and various disclosures described in this document and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements a nd notes thereto submitted as a separate section of this form k item 
significant accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements of filenet in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the consolidated financ ial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that af fect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amoun ts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies we believe are most cr itical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of software licenses sol d through direct and indirect channels  which do not contain multiple elements  are recognized upon shipment of the related product  if the requirements of statement of position sop  as amended  are met 
if the requirements of sop  including evidence of an arrangement  delivery  fixed or determinable fee  collectibility or vendor specific evidence about the value of an element are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recogniz ed until such elements are known or resolved 
software license revenue for arrangements to deliver unspecified a dditional software products in the future is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the initial shipment 
we recognize other revenue at the time of product delivery and accrue any remaining costs  incl uding vendor obligations 
revenue from post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of th e contract 
revenue from professional services is recognized as such services are delivered and accepted by the cu stomer 
based on historical experience  we maintain a sales returns allowance for the estimated amount of potential re turns related to unforeseen events 
while such returns have historically been minimal and within our expectations o f the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we hav e in the past 
accounts receivable 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our custo mers prior to order fulfillment and we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to adjust credit li mits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we constantly monitor collections from o ur customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses that is based on historical experience and on specific customer collection issues 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provision s established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our revenue recognition policy requires customers to be creditworthy  our accounts receivable a re based on customers whose payment is reasonably assured 
our accounts receivable are derived from sales to a wide variety of customers 
we do not believe a change in liquidity of any one customer or our inability to collect from any one customer would have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax e ffects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting pur poses and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferre d tax asset due to uncertainty regarding the future realization based on historical taxable income  projected future t axable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income we could be required to increase the valuation allowance agai nst all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets which would result in a substantial increase to our e ffective tax rate and could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results 
long lived assets 
we account for the impairment and dispositi on of long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 acc ounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that their c arrying value may not be recoverable 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas n o 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial account ing and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
sup ersedes sfas no 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we evaluate the carrying valu e of intangible assets for impairment of value based on undiscounted future cash flows 
while we have not experie nced impairment of intangible assets in prior periods  we cannot guarantee that there will not be impairment in the fut ure 
other operating matters we took selective actions in to help drive profitability and t o reduce on going annual expenses 
these actions included cost saving measures  internal business process changes to improve efficiency and a worldwide workforce reduction of employees 
workforce reductions occurred durin g the second and fourth quarters of resulting in a total severance charge of million 
these severance cha rges were  in customer support   in professional services   in research and development and million in selling  general and administrative  as discussed below 
overview our revenue growth depends on the overall demand for computer soft ware and services primarily to corporate and government customers 
in general  a weakening economy will most likely r esult in a decline in demand for computer software that will result in decreased revenue for us 
during fiscal we experienced a decrease in software revenue on a worldwide basis and we believe this decrease was primarily due to a macro economic slow down which has decreased our revenue stream 
we are currently unable to predict when the glo bal economic slowdown in the technology sector will cease to have a negative impact on our revenues and results of oper ations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of opera tions data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue december  revenue software customer support professional services and education hardware total revenue cost of revenue software customer support professional services and education hardware total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss before tax revenue total revenue decreased to million in from mill ion in  representing a decrease of million  or 
from to  total revenue increased by million  or 
the decrease in total revenue from to was primarily attributable to lower software reve nue as a result of unfavorable economic conditions in resulting in decreased demand for our software products 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in service revenues 
the increase from to was largely due to an increased customer base  broader software functionality  new product introductions  and an increased emphasis on professional services 
software 
software revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of our software products to customers 
software revenue decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
from to  software revenue increased 
million from million  or 
the decrease from to is primarily due to the significant global eco nomic slowdown in the technology sector that resulted in a significant reduction in the amount and size of customer orders 
large enterprise projects were eliminated or replaced by smaller projects as information technology budgets we re reduced and delayed in we expect that the trend toward smaller projects will continue for the foreseeable future 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to large scale deployments of our software product s  as well as growth in the number of our customers 
these expanded deployments resulted primarily from our web enabled archi tecture as well as a more favorable it spending environment 
customer support 
customer support revenue consists of revenue from software maintenance contracts and fee for service revenues and the sale of spare parts and supplies 
customer sup port revenue increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of mill ion  or 
from to customer support revenue increased by million from million  or 
these i ncreases in customer support revenue were primarily due to the growth in our base of customers who receive ongoing maintenance as a result of new customer sales  sales of additional products to our installed base and a high rate of renewal on the existing base 
we expect these trends to continue in the near future 
however  a prolonged economic slowdown will result in a decrease in the growth rate of customer support revenue and potentially a decrease in the act ual maintenance revenue as this revenue stream is directly related to software revenue fluctuations over time 
professional services and education 
professional services and educ ation revenue is generated primarily from consulting and implementation services provided to end users of our software p roducts  technical consulting services provided to our resellers and training services 
professional services are ge nerally performed on a time and material basis 
professional services and education revenue increased to mil lion in from million in  representing an increase of million  or 
from to profes sional services and education revenue increased by million from million  or 
these increases were p rimarily attributable to an increase in custom development projects  and to a lesser extent  an increase in sales o f prepackaged service offerings  which include both consulting and training 
as part of our business plan  we focused on expanding our professional services capabilities to support our solutions and applications strategy and we pl an to continue such focus 
however  a prolonged economic slowdown will result in a decrease in the growth rate o f professional services and education revenue and potentially a decrease in the absolute dollar amount of these reven ues 
hardware 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from the sale of inch osar libraries 
hardware revenue decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
from to hardware revenue increased by million from million  or 
the decrease in compared to was primarily attributable to the economic downturn that caused a reduc tion in orders for the osar product 
the increase in was primarily due to increased demand for gigabyte drive s as delayed orders from resulting from yk uncertainty were placed in hardware is not a strategic focus for us and we expect hardware revenue to remain flat or decrease in absolute dollars in future periods 
international 
international revenues accounted for of total rev enue  or million  in  of total revenue  or million  in  and of total revenue  or million  in a significant portion of international sales are denominated in the local currency of the country w here sold 
the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies unfavorably impacted revenue reported i n us dollars in and and to a lesser extent in the decrease in absolute dollars in as compare d to is primarily the result of a significant reduction in the amount and size of customer orders in europe and a sia  our largest international markets  due to a major slowdown in it spending 
we expect international revenue t o continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue 
however  international revenues will be adverse ly affected if the us dollar continues to strengthen against certain major international currencies and economic condi tions continue to weaken 
cost of revenue total cost of revenue decreased to million in  from million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
from to total cost of revenue in creased by million  or 
the decrease in total cost of revenue from to is primarily attributable to lower software and hardware costs which can be directly related to lower software and hardware revenue  as well as the unbundling and discontinuation of certain third party products 
the increase from to was largely due to increases in cost in our service segments offset in part by decreases in software cost 
software cost of software revenue includes royalties paid to th ird parties  media costs  and the cost to manufacture and distribute software 
the cost of software revenue was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of software reve nue  respectively 
the decreases as a percentage of software revenue are primarily attributable to lower distr ibution costs as well as a reduction in royalty costs due to the unbundling and discontinuation of certain third part y products 
however  we expect product license costs to increase in the future as a percent of software revenue due to costs related to the integration of third party technology that we may choose to embed in our product offerings 
customer support 
cost of customer support revenue includes the cost of customer support personnel  supplies and spare parts  and the cost of third party hardware maintenance 
the cos t of customer support revenue was million in  million in and million in  representin g   and of customer support revenue  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily at tributable to a reduction in variable compensation and personnel as well as cost benefits from process improvements initiated in workforce reductions in resulted in severance costs of  that were absorbed by the benefit of ongoing reduced salary and personnel expenses for and the near future 
the decrease in customer s upport cost as a percentage of customer support revenue in from was primarily attributable to process changes that allowed growth in the customer base without a proportional increase in support personnel and cost 
due to increased productivity and controls over headcount we expect to maintain these cost efficiencies for the near future 
professional services and education 
cost of professional services and education revenue consists primarily of professional services personnel  training personnel  and third party contractors 
the cost of professional services and education revenue was million in  millio n in and million in  representing  and of professional services and education revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and an increase in the use of third party independent contractors 
these costs were necessary to deliver increase d revenues 
additionally  we recorded a charge of approximately  for severance payments 
expressed as a perce ntage of revenue  costs were essentially unchanged from to the increase in cost from to was primar ily due to increased personnel costs as we focused on building professional services capabilities to support our solutions oriented strategy 
we expect professional services and education costs as a percentage of professional ser vices and education revenue to vary from period to period depending on the utilization rates of internal resources a nd the mix between internal and external service providers 
hardware 
cost of hardware revenue includes the cost of assembling our osar library products  the cost of hardware integration personnel  warranty costs and distribution costs 
the c ost of hardware revenue was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of hardware revenue  respectively 
the year to year increases in cost of hardware revenue as a p ercent of hardware revenue were primarily due to increased warranty costs and unabsorbed fixed expenses 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense cons ists primarily of personnel costs for software developers  contracted development efforts and related facilities costs 
research and development expense was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in expense from to was primaril y due to increased numbers of personnel  salary increases and increased consulting costs necessary for development of our strategy 
in addition  we paid a one time bonus of million related to the application partners  incorpo rated api acquisition and recorded severance costs of approximately  the increase in expense from to was primarily due to market driven increases in salaries and recruiting costs as a result of the intens e competitive environment for software engineers and an increase in the rates of contract developers 
we have made substantial investments in research and development  primarily through internal development activities  and to a lesser extent  through technology acquisitions 
our dev elopment efforts use our ecm platform to deliver industry vertical applications and a next generation high through put transaction oriented collaborative commerce platform 
our development efforts also seek to deliver end t o end ecm capability in the market 
additionally  we embed third party software that enhances the functionality of our products through a variety of oem agreements 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in internal deve lopment with a focus on developing new functionality in business process management  web content management and co llaborative commerce applications that provide a richer competitive product offering to our customers 
we expect t hat competition for qualified technical personnel will continue for the foreseeable future and may result in higher le vels of compensation expense for us 
we believe that research and development expenditures  including compensation o f technical personnel  are essential to maintaining our competitive position and expect these costs to continue to constitute a significant percentage of total revenue in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and adminis trative expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  sales commissions and other expenses related to the d irect and indirect sales force  various marketing expenses  the cost of other market development programs  per sonnel costs for finance  information technology  legal  human resources and general management  and the cost of o utside professional services 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in  mil lion in and million in selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of total revenue  was in  in and in the increase as a percentage of total revenue for from was pr imarily due to a lower revenue base and higher costs 
the decrease as percent of total revenue for from was primarily due to cost containment measures and expense control  along with higher revenue 
the increase i n absolute dollars in from was primarily due to increased expenses including legal fees  it and facility cost s and increased expenses associated with the expansion of sales and marketing for certain key areas  such as our new brightspire product 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million for twelve months in com pared to million for seven months in charges for severance of million related to workforce reduction s and facility consolidation costs of  primarily in sales  in also contributed to the increase ye ar over year 
however  these workforce reductions and the facility consolidation will reduce personnel costs in t he near future 
the increase in absolute dollars in from was primarily due to performance based incentives  recruitment costs for sales personnel and higher depreciation costs 
we expect to maintain expense controls over sellin g  general and administrative costs in accordingly  these costs during should remain relatively consistent with purchased in process research and development 
based upon an independ ent third party appraisal  we allocated approximately million to in process research and development in connec tion with our purchase of certain assets from api in may the in process research and development expenses were r elated to new product projects that were under development at the date of the acquisition and were expected to eventu ally lead to new products but had not yet established feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identi fied 
the valuation of the in process research and development projects was based upon the discounted expected f uture net cash flows of the products over their expected life  reflecting the estimated percent of completion of the projects and an estimate of the costs to complete the projects 
new product development projects underway at api at the time of the acquisition included sequis  an eservice application which we estimated to be complete at t he date of the acquisition 
the cost to complete the project was estimated at approximately  to occur o ver a three month period 
we incurred approximately  of research and development expenses related to the project which was complete as of september  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
in conjunction with our acquisition of certain assets of api in may  the purchase price amount allocated to goodwill was milli on  which was being amortized over five years 
the purchase price amount allocated to assembled workforce was   which was being amortized over three years 
amortization which is included in selling  general and administr ative expense was million in compared to million in with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we will no longer amortize goodwill and assembled workforce but will evaluate their car rying value on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired 
we expect the impact of this adoption will be a decrease in amortization expense of approximately million in other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of inte rest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and other items including forei gn exchange gains and losses  other items of income  and interest expense 
other income  net of other expenses  was million in  million in and million in the decrease in from was primarily att ributable to a million settlement charge included in other expenses partially offset by increased interest inco me related to a higher cash balance 
the increase in from was attributable to increased interest income dire ctly related to higher cash balances and a foreign exchange gain for the year  partially offset by increases in othe r expense related to an accrual of million for a pending patent settlement 
provision for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was million in  compared to a provision of million in and a provision of million in the effect ive tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduced ta x rate in was primarily due to the generation of domestic and irish taxable loss before stock option deductions  partially offset by earnings generated in high tax foreign jurisdictions 
filenet management will continue weighing various evidence throughout each year to assess the recoverability of its recorded deferred assets and the need for any valuation allowance against such amounts 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents  and investments w ere million  an increase of million from million at december  cash provided by operating activities in was million an d resulted primarily from a substantial decrease in accounts receivable due to decreased revenue and strong col lections and additions to net loss for depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a net loss of million  decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  including accrued compensation and benefits  a nd federal income tax payable 
cash used for investing activities in was million consisting primarily of c apital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities in was million consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of employee stock opt ions under the employee and non employee director stock purchase plan and income tax benefit from stock options 
cash provided by operating activities in was million an d resulted primarily from net income of million  an increase in unearned maintenance revenue related to prepaid maintenance contracts  and additions to net income for depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by incr eases in accounts receivable  deferred income taxes  and prepaid expenses 
cash used for investing activities in totaled million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for an acquisition 
cash prov ided by financing activities in was million  consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of employee stock options under the employee and non employee director stock purchase plan and in come tax benefit from stock options 
cash provided by operating activities in was million an d resulted primarily from net income of million  an increase in unearned maintenance revenue related to prepaid maintenance contracts  additions to net income for depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash used for investing activities totaled million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities  partial ly offset by proceeds from the sales of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities in was million  c onsisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of employee stock options under the em ployee and non employee director stock purchase plan 
our capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in our primary capital expenditures during these years were for research and de velopment equipment  demonstration and training equipment  enhancements to our internal network and business sys tems  leasehold improvements on leased property  and furniture 
we have a one year  million multi currency revolving line of credit that expires on june  borrowings under the arrangement are unsecured and bear interest at one h undred and twenty basis points over the london interbank offered rate 
an annual commitment fee of twenty basis points is assessed against any undrawn amounts 
we are restricted from paying dividends during the term of the arrang ement and  under the arrangement  must comply with certain financial covenants  including quarterly and annual profi tability covenants for which we received a waiver from the bank 
there were no borrowings outstanding at december  and we anticipate that our present cash balances  together with internall y generated funds and credit lines  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures through out  which are anticipated to be approximately million 
we have no long term debt 
other matters european monetary union 
on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
these countries agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency from that date 
the legacy currencies remain ed legal tender in these countries as a denomination of the euro between january  and january  beginn ing on january   euro denominated bills and coins are now issued for cash transactions 
for a period of up to six months from this date  both legacy currencies and the euro will be legal tender 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currencies and exclusively use the euro 
we have made the necessary changes to our internal business systems to support transactions denominated in the euro  including establishing euro price lists for affected countries 
we h ave been transacting in the euro currency since and have evaluated the impact the euro has had on our finan cial condition and results of operations 
based on this evaluation to date  we currently do not believe that there has been or will be a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of the e uro conversion 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  i s effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  established accounting and reporti ng standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts that we re not formerly considered derivatives and now may meet the definition of a derivative 
additionally  this standa rd required us to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are hedges  changes in the fair value of derivatives are offset by the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitme nts 
we adopted this standard effective january  and it has had no significant effect on our results of operatio ns  financial position  or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which was effective immediately 
sfas no 
required that the purchase method of accounting be used for all busines s combinations initiated after june  and eliminated the pooling of interests method 
we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intang ible assets  which is effective for us january  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
we will no longer amortize intangible assets but will evaluate their carrying value on an annual basis or when even ts or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
to re sult in reduced amortization expense of approximately million in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impai rment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations 
sfas no 
supersedes sfa s no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and is eff ective for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
inflation 
management believes that inflation has not had a significant impac t on the price of our products  the cost of our materials  or our operating results for any of the three years ended dec ember  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we empl oy established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency valu es 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest r ates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investm ent portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit expo sure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securi ties with maturities of less than three years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
avai lable for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separat e component of stockholders equity 
foreign currency risk 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contr acts primarily to hedge amounts due from and the net assets of selected subsidiaries denominated in foreign currenc ies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward forei gn exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a he dge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to under lying transactions 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
if an underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier tha n initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be rec ognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign curre ncy denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
our forward contracts genera lly have an original maturity of three months 
the total notional values of forward contracts purchased and fo rward contracts sold in were million and million  respectively 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results see note to the consolidated financial stat ements
