the company recorded million as non operating income in associated with the grant received pursuant to the legislation 
capacity  as measured by scheduled service available seat miles asms  increased in capacity increased at midwest express and at astral 
astral s capacity increase was due to the addition of three new regional jets into scheduled service  as well as the fact that a number of midwest express routes were shifted to smaller astral aircraft to more efficiently handle fourth quarter decreased passenger levels 
capacity was significantly impacted by flight cancellations in the third quarter  primarily due to the september terrorist attacks and capacity reductions thereafter as a result of low passenger volume 
first quarter capacity is expected to decline from first quarter flight schedules and aircraft utilization for the remainder of will depend on travel demand  however  the company expects to gradually increase capacity beginning in march as additional operations to washington national are restored and flight frequency is increased in other markets to meet increasing demand for travel 
the company s total revenue in decreased million  or  from to million

load factor decreased from in to in astral passenger revenue increased million  or  from to million in traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles  increased 
load factor increased from in to in revenue yield decreased  from in to in  due to decreased business travel as a result of the slowing economy  a revised mix of longer flights with lower yields  and lower fares after september that were used to stimulate travel demand 
revenue from cargo  charter and other services increased million in this fluctuation was primarily attributable to a million increase in frequent flyer program partnership revenue  primarily from the sale of frequent flyer miles  a million increase in charter sales and a million increase in service charge fees  offset by a million decrease in cargo revenue 
mail volumes decreased in as more mail was transported by ground transportation or dedicated freight carriers 
in addition  cargo revenue decreased because of the weak economy and a reduction in mail volume following september due to tighter security requirements that limit the weight of mail that can be transported 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  from the increase was primarily the result of higher labor costs  an increase in depreciation and amortization  and an million asset impairment charge associated with eight owned dc aircraft 
these increases were offset by lower fuel costs and lower aircraft maintenance costs 
cost per asm excluding the impairment charge increased at midwest express and decreased at astral in the company s cost per total asm increased  from cent in to cent in salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits increased million  or  from to million in labor costs increased on a cost per asm basis 
increased labor costs were primarily the result of increased labor rates million at midwest express and astral 
the majority of the labor rate increases were for customer service and maintenance employees at midwest express  effective in second quarter these rate adjustments were implemented based on industry salary surveys and management s desire to increase pay scales to maintain a competitive position in the industry 
other factors causing the change in salaries  wages and benefits were increased headcount million and increased benefit costs million  primarily due to higher medical insurance costs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in overtime pay

roundtrip catering allows meals to be loaded only at the origin city of a roundtrip route  as opposed to loading the aircraft with meals at both cities on the route 
station rental  landing and other fees station rental  landing and other fees increased million  or  from to million in midwest express operated fewer flight segments and astral operated more flight segments  causing the net increase 
airport costs were favorably impacted by abnormally good weather in fourth quarter and a reduction in costs at the milwaukee airport following the september terrorist attacks 
aircraft maintenance materials and repairs maintenance costs decreased by million  or  from to million in aircraft maintenance costs decreased on a cost per total asm basis 
costs at midwest express decreased million  or  in while costs at astral increased million  or 
the decrease at midwest express was primarily due to lower engine repair costs  lower purchased maintenance costs and cost savings realized through the msg program  whereby major airframe maintenance events are divided into smaller  more frequent events that result in fewer duplicate tasks  and airframe maintenance costs are expensed as they are incurred 
costs at astral increased as a result of three additional regional jets entering scheduled service during depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  from to million in the increase was primarily the result of depreciation associated with one additional owned md series aircraft and three additional owned regional jets placed in service during aircraft rentals aircraft rental costs increased million  or  from to million in the costs associated with the addition of one leased md aircraft were mostly offset by the reduction in lease costs due to lower interest rates for three dc aircraft and five beechcraft d aircraft 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  from to million in other operating expenses consist of advertising and promotion  insurance  legal fees  property taxes  consulting services  crew hotel rooms  reservation booking fees  administration and other items

costs included a million loss on the retirement of one dc aircraft due to significantly reduced capacity following september and a million gain on the sale of the former astral maintenance hangar 
in  other expenses were favorably impacted by a nonrecurring million settlement of a sales and use tax dispute on meals boarded on aircraft in wisconsin 
other significant cost increases in included higher legal fees million  due primarily to the fairchild dornier dispute  and higher crew hotel room costs

impairment loss in the second quarter  the company recorded an million impairment charge associated with the write down in carrying value of eight owned dc aircraft that the company intends to retire earlier than originally planned 
in connection with this decision  the company performed evaluations to determine  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amounts 
as a result of the evaluation  the company determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amounts  resulting in an impairment  as defined by sfas no 
consequently  the original cost basis of these aircraft was reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date of the decision  resulting in an million pre tax impairment loss  and the remaining depreciable lives were adjusted for the new retirement schedule 
in determining the fair market value of these assets  the company considered market trends in aircraft dispositions  data from third parties and management estimates 
depreciation on these aircraft going forward will be almost unchanged as the shorter life was offset by the decrease in cost basis 
interest income and interest expense interest income reflects interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense consists of mortgage interest associated with the company s headquarters building  interest on the short term note payable  and on the company s long term debt  a secured bank credit facility 
interest expense increased in due to an increase in use of the company s credit facility and interest costs associated with the debt financing of three regional jet aircraft and one md series aircraft

midwest express passenger revenue increased million  or  from to million 
this increase was caused by a increase in revenue yield and an increase of in passenger volume 
total midwest express capacity  as measured by scheduled service asms  increased due to additional aircraft in service during capacity was constrained by a shortage of trained pilots to support the company s growth plan  by compliance with the new faa mandated crew rest reserve rules  and by an increase in flight cancellations 
load factor decreased from in to in due to poor performance of the indianapolis operation  a threat of a pilot s strike in the first quarter  and increased competition on some routes 
astral passenger revenue increased million  or  from to million 
traffic increased on a increase in capacity due to the operation of five regional jets during most of load factor decreased from in to in the company s revenue from cargo  charter and other services decreased million  or  in although charter revenues increased million in  anticipated revenues were constrained when the dedicated charter aircraft was extensively damaged by a third party in early november and a majority of charter services were subcontracted to other airlines 
mail volumes decreased in as more mail was transported by ground transportation or dedicated freight carriers 
freight volumes declined because of increased competition 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  from primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased labor and aircraft maintenance costs 
aircraft utilization decreased significantly in the second half of the year due to flight cancellations related to poor weather  maintenance issues and a shortage of trained pilots to support the company s growth plan and comply with the revised faa mandated crew rest reserve rules 
because of this  midwest express operated only more flights during the year  although it had two additional aircraft in service 
astral had similar issues with higher fuel prices and low utilization 
the regional jets operated at about utilization  but had the infrastructure to support full utilization 
offsetting higher costs in most categories were lower commission costs and no profit sharing 
on a cost per total asm basis  midwest express operating expenses increased  from cent to cent in  cost per total asm at astral increased  from cent to cent 
salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits increased million  or  from to million in on a cost per total asm basis  these costs increased  from cent in to cent in the labor cost increase reflected the addition of full time equivalent employees at midwest express and at astral from and increases in labor rates 
midwest express added employees throughout the organization to support the two additional aircraft placed in service 
midwest express also added mechanics to support growth  and to complete aircraft modifications and repairs more efficiently 
pilot costs at midwest express increased due to a contract signing bonus  increased wage rates associated with the new contract  and the implementation of the new faa mandated interpretation of crew rest reserve rules  which added the equivalent of pilots with no increased flying 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in the profit sharing and management incentive plan costs 
aircraft fuel and oil aircraft fuel and oil and associated taxes increased million  or  from to million in into plane fuel prices increased in  averaging per gallon in versus cent per gallon in  generating a million unfavorable price variance 
the company managed the price risk of fuel to some extent by purchasing commodity options that establish ceiling prices

commissions commissions decreased million  or  from to million in the decrease was primarily due to a new commission rate structure that reduced base travel agent commissions from to effective october in addition  the company realized savings due to increased travel booked directly through its reservations centers  midwest express web site  other travel related web sites and ticket counters 
dining services the company s dining services costs increased million  or  from to million in the increase was primarily due to a increase in food and services prices 
total dining services costs including food  beverages  linen  catering equipment and supplies increased from per midwest express passenger in to in station rental  landing and other fees station rental  landing and other fees increased million  or  from to million in the increase was caused by more flight segments at astral and higher airport costs throughout the system

the company s aircraft maintenance costs increased on a cost per total asm basis 
the increase was attributable to higher than expected costs for engine repairs  increased costs associated with transition to the new msg aircraft maintenance program  and higher use of contract labor 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  from to million in the increase was primarily the result of the depreciation associated with two additional md aircraft placed into service  aircraft noise hushkits  and capital spending associated with the start up of the regional jet program

the charge was million  net of tax  for a change in accounting methods for frequent flyer partner miles  partially offset by a million  net of tax  adjustment for major airframe maintenance due to the company s transition to dividing major maintenance events into smaller  more frequent events  and to expense all airframe maintenance costs as they are incurred 
net income net income for was million  a decrease of million from the net income margin decreased from in to in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the year 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  future results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are policies that reflect material judgment and uncertainty and may result in materially different results using different assumptions or conditions 
the company identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  frequent flyer revenue and impairment of long lived assets 
for a detailed discussion of accounting policies  refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition passenger revenue  related commissions  if any  and cargo revenues are recognized in the period when the service is provided 
a portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credit is deferred and recognized when transportation is provided to the passenger 
contract maintenance revenue is recognized when work is completed and invoiced 
the estimated liability for sold  but unused  tickets is included in current liabilities as air traffic liability 
the amount of commissions associated with unearned revenue is included in current assets as prepaid commissions 
frequent flyer revenue effective january   the company adopted staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december sab provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
prior to the issuance of sab  the company recognized all revenue from frequent flyer miles sold to partners  net of the incremental cost of providing future air travel  when the mileage credits were sold  which was consistent with most major airlines 
beginning january   as a result of adopting sab  the company changed its method used to account for participating partners such as credit card companies  hotels and car rental agencies 
under the new accounting method  a portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credits is deferred and recognized when transportation is provided to the passenger 
the company believes the new method appropriately matches revenues with the period in which services are provided 
the estimated incremental cost of providing future transportation in conjunction with travel miles under the company s frequent flyer program is accrued based on estimated redemption percentages applied to actual mileage recorded in members accounts 
the ultimate cost will depend on the actual redemption of frequent flyer miles and may be greater or less than amounts accrued at december  impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
during the second quarter  the company decided to accelerate the retirement of eight midwest express dc aircraft 
in connection with this decision  the company performed evaluations to determine  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amounts 
as a result of the evaluation  the company determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amount  resulting in an impairment as defined by sfas no 
consequently  the original cost bases of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date of the decision  resulting in an million pre tax impairment loss  and the remaining depreciable lives were adjusted for the new retirement schedule 
in determining the fair market value of these assets  the company considered market trends in aircraft dispositions  data from third parties and management estimates 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the increased cash position was primarily generated from million in proceeds associated with a sale leaseback of an md series aircraft and an additional million from the debt financing of an md series aircraft  an million draw on the company s revolving bank credit facility  and million in grant money associated with the federal government s air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
an additional million in grant money is expected to be received in the first quarter of net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during net cash used in investing activities totaled million  due to capital expenditures of million  including million of purchase deposits on flight equipment 
as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of million versus a million deficit on december  the working capital deficit is primarily due to the company s air traffic liability which represents deferred revenue for advance bookings  whereby passengers have purchased tickets for future flights and revenue is recognized when the passenger travels and the frequent flyer program liability 
because of this  the company expects to operate at a working capital deficit  which is not unusual for the industry 
as of december   the company had a million bank credit facility 
the credit facility  scheduled to expire august   is secured by  with certain exceptions  substantially all non aircraft personal property assets of the company and by certain aircraft 
the credit facility agreement requires quarterly compliance of certain financial covenants 
the fees and borrowing costs under the agreement are higher than they were prior to august   which is the date the facility became effective 
the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is libor plus basis points 
that interest rate spread and certain fees and costs are subject to reduction based upon improved financial covenant performance 
as of december   the company had borrowings under the facility totaling million 
the company made a million payment of principal in connection with the amendment in january that reduced borrowings to million 
in addition  as of december   letters of credit totaling approximately million were outstanding under the credit facility  reducing the available credit by that amount 
the letters of credit are primarily used to support financing of the company s maintenance facilities and for other purposes 
the availability of the million under the credit facility is subject to a calculation based on the valuation of certain elements of the collateral that provide security for the credit facility 
the credit facility agreement was amended in january to change the way that calculation is done 
as a result  the company may obtain credit of up to million on the basis of personal property assets and  if the company mortgages its headquarters real estate to the banks  additional credit of up to million on the basis of the headquarters real estate 
consequently  unless the company provides a mortgage of its headquarters property  the company may not obtain credit under the credit facility exceeding million 
prior to mortgaging the headquarters real estate to the banks  the company must obtain the consent of the mortgage lender holding a first mortgage on the headquarters 
if the company obtains that consent and proceeds to give a second mortgage to the banks  then the amount of additional credit that will become available to the company will be reduced by the amount of the prior mortgage and limited by the appraised value of the headquarters property 
as a result  even if the company satisfies the conditions to obtaining additional credit on the basis of the headquarters real estate  it is unlikely that the amount of that additional credit would equal the million of potential additional credit availability 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the bank credit agreement 
the company also expects to meet the covenants for the first quarter and for the remaining term of the agreement 
if the company is not able to comply with the covenants  it expects to be able to negotiate a waiver for the noncompliance 
if the company is not able to comply with the covenants and the relevant banks do not agree to modify them  then the million outstanding in january  which includes outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement  could become immediately due and payable 
further  the credit agreement expires august  the company must be able to extend or replace the credit agreement through its existing banks and or new banks at or before the time it expires  because all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement would otherwise become due and payable 
the company has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by customers of the company 
among them is an agreement with an organization that processes mastercard visa transactions  this organization is also a lender under the bank credit facility 
this agreement was amended in january to allow the credit card processor to create and maintain a reserve account that it funded by retaining cash that it otherwise would deliver to the company under the agreement 
credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel in the future because the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the company soon after the purchase is completed  the air travel generally occurs after that time  and the processor would have liability if the company does not ultimately deliver the travel 
as a result of this amendment  the credit card processor has retained cash representing percent of the credit card processor s risk exposure determined on a daily basis  or approximately million 
the percent level is the maximum that the credit card processor may withhold unless a specified triggering event occurs under the credit card processing agreement  at which time the credit card processor may increase the reserve to percent of its risk exposure 
the triggering events include failure of the company to meet certain liquidity or leverage type covenants  breaches of the company s obligations under the card processing agreement and default under the bank credit facility agreement 
the company anticipates meeting all required credit card processing agreement covenants for the first quarter the credit card processing agreement is secured by a second priority lien  with certain exceptions  on substantially all non aircraft personal property assets of the company and certain aircraft 
capital spending totaled million for the year ended december  capital expenditures consisted primarily of aircraft acquisition and refurbishment costs million  engine overhauls and spare parts 
the company expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  primarily related to refurbishment of an aircraft  engine overhauls and spare parts  and costs associated with improving and maintaining the company s information technology systems 
during  the company signed a purchase agreement to acquire four md series aircraft 
the company has taken delivery of three of the aircraft and financed the delivery using internal cash flow 
the company terminated the contract to purchase the fourth aircraft  based on a soft economy and desire to focus on boeing aircraft scheduled to begin arriving in february in june  one md series aircraft was debt financed for seven years at a fixed interest rate 
in july  the company completed a sale and leaseback of an md series aircraft 
the term of the operating lease is years 
three jets were partially debt financed in  each for a period up to months at fixed rates 
the jets will likely be refinanced for longer terms when the initial financing comes due in the company s board of directors has authorized a million common stock repurchase program 
as of december   the company has repurchased a total of  shares of common stock at a cost of million 
no shares were repurchased during in october  midwest express took occupancy of a newly constructed maintenance facility that is leased from milwaukee county and located at general mitchell international airport 
to finance the million project  the city of milwaukee issued tax exempt  variable rate demand industrial development revenue bonds 
the company s variable lease payments are based on the current interest rate of the city of milwaukee s outstanding bonds over the year lease term 
the bonds are secured by a letter of credit  pursuant to the company s million credit facility 
interest payments made to bondholders and amortization of principal are recorded as rent expense 
on april   the company completed a million financing of a new maintenance facility for astral located at general mitchell international airport 
construction was completed and occupancy of the new maintenance facility occurred in february the facility is financed by year tax exempt  variable rate demand industrial development revenue bonds issued by the city of milwaukee 
to ensure the tax exempt status  milwaukee county is the owner of the facility 
the bonds are secured by a letter of credit  pursuant to the company s million credit facility 
interest payments made to bondholders and amortization of principal are recorded as rent expense 
given the uncertainties associated with the aftermath of the events of september  and economic conditions in general and those of the airline industry in particular  the company continues to operate in a highly unpredictable environment 
the company s credit facility expires on august  see note 
the company believes that it will be able to renegotiate this credit facility at terms acceptable to the company 
in the event the company cannot renegotiate the credit facility with the current collateral arrangements  the company would have the option of applying for a federal loan guarantee pursuant to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
the company believes that it would qualify for guarantees to support substantially all of the outstanding amounts at december  based upon the current general economic and industry outlook  the company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  funds available from and the renewal of credit facilities see note  federal government grant money  and fairchild arbitration settlement proceeds see note will be adequate to meet its current and anticipated working capital requirements 
if these sources are inadequate or become unavailable  the company will pursue additional funds through the mortgage of unencumbered assets  recovery of amounts withheld related to credit card transactions and funds available with the benefit of federal loan guarantees 
the company believes that all of these sources will be adequate to meet its current and anticipated working capital requirements through these beliefs take into consideration the company s results of operations in through february and are based on a number of assumptions including without limitation the following a the company benefits from favorable business developments during the remainder of consistent with historical seasonal patterns  b there is no further material deterioration in general economic conditions or the airline industry in particular  c there are no material adverse political developments or domestic events  d there is no material change in the competitive environment  and e there are no further material increases in costs associated with new faa security directives or the aviation and transportation security act 
actual results could differ in a material and adverse manner depending upon the ultimate validity of these assumptions 
regardless  two new aircraft programs boeing and embraer regional jets discussed in the pending developments section will require substantial cash and short term financing for progress payments followed by long term financing upon or after delivery 
availability of the requisite cash and financing cannot be assured 
long term financing transactions would not be consummated until close to the aircraft delivery dates 
consummation of financing will be subject to  among other things  general economic conditions and the company s financial condition at the time 
these agreements are not included in the contractual obligation schedule shown below 
the following table of material debt and lease commitments at december   summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods set forth below in thousands related cash outflows contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt excluding interest        aircraft operating leases        non aircraft operating leases        all capital leases total        pending developments capacity reduction due to the events of september and their aftermath  the company reduced its flight schedule to closer align with expected travel demand 
first quarter capacity is expected to decline from first quarter flight schedules and aircraft utilization for the remainder of will depend on travel demand 
the company expects to gradually increase capacity beginning in march as additional operations to washington national are restored and flight frequency is increased in other markets to meet increasing demand for travel 
md series aircraft the company has one remaining owned md series aircraft that has not been placed in service 
the refurbishment process for this aircraft has been temporarily suspended and will be completed after travel demand dictates the need for more capacity 
boeing aircraft in april  the company signed a memorandum of understanding for firm orders for new boeing aircraft  with purchase rights for an additional aircraft 
the purchase agreement for the aircraft was signed in september under the purchase agreement  delivery of the aircraft is scheduled to begin in february these aircraft will be used to expand service in existing and new markets  and also eventually replace the dc aircraft in the midwest express fleet 
regional jet aircraft astral operates passenger fairchild dornier jet regional jets 
in september  the company settled its pending arbitration with fairchild dornier gmbh over the cancellation of the jet program 
in first quarter  the company expects to receive and record a million pre tax gain million after tax associated with the settlement 
the gain  which represents a majority of the potential gain from benefits of the settlement  includes a cash payment and substantial discounts on two jets the ninth and tenth in its regional jet fleet that were received in january and february two additional jet aircraft are scheduled for delivery in october and december future benefits of the remainder of the settlement will be recorded when received 
in april  the company signed a memorandum of understanding placing firm orders for new embraer regional jets  with options to purchase additional aircraft  in august  the parties signed a purchase agreement relating to this order 
the firm order is valued at million 
under this purchase agreement  delivery of the aircraft was scheduled to begin in january in march  the company reached agreement with embraer to delay delivery of the first aircraft until january this delay will allow the company to concentrate on the introduction of boeing aircraft to the midwest express fleet in and also provide additional time for the company to evaluate financing alternatives for aircraft acquisitions 
the company plans to use the new embraer regional jets to expand service in existing and new markets 
these regional jets are expected to provide astral with flexibility to serve markets with differing capacity demands 
insurance due to the events of september  aviation insurance carriers have significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance  as well as war risk coverage insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
the company believes premiums for will increase approximately million over levels 
labor relations in april  midwest express flight attendants elected the association of flight attendants afa  afl cio  a labor union  for the purpose of representation in collective bargaining 
negotiations began in january in september  afa requested assistance from the national mediation board nmb 
in february  afa requested to be released from mediation by the nmb
