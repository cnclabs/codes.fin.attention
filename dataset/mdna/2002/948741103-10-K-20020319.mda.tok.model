item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
the results of operations and financial condition of the company  as reflected in the accompanying statements and related footnotes  is subject to managements evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of the company s tenancy 
management believes the most critical accounting policies in this regard are the estimation of an allowance for doubtful receivables more specifically the allowance for straight line receivables and the determination of reserves for self insured general liability insurance 
both of these issues require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature  however  management is able to consider and assess a significant amount of historical data and current market data in arriving at reasonable estimates

numerous retailer bankruptcies across the country have been announced 
wri has four service merchandise and seven kmart stores 
the communication and timing of store closings varies by retailer  however  we believe the effect of these bankruptcies and other known retailer failures will reduce our net operating income in by approximately million 
with the significant diversification of wri s tenant base  we would not expect further retailer bankruptcies to have a significant effect on the liquidity of our company

overall  direct operating costs and expenses as a percentage of rental revenues were in  and bad debt expense increased from

funds from operations the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  nareit recommends that extraordinary items not be considered in arriving at ffo 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
most industry analysts and equity reits  including wri  believe ffo is an alternative measure of performance relative to other reits 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by wri is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements  or principal payments on indebtedness 
page funds from operations is calculated as follows in thousands net income available to common shareholders 














   depreciation and amortization 





















   depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures 





   gain on sales of property

   effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in wri has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby wri receives rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of wri s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows wri to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of wri s leases require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon wri s operating results 
new accounting pronouncements on january   wri adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
specifically  sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value 
additionally  the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and  if so  the nature of the hedging activity 
wri hedges the future cash flows of debt transactions principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
wri has four interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that convert variable interest payments to fixed interest payments at rates from to 
these swaps have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
we have determined these swap agreements are highly effective in offsetting future variable interest cash flows of the related debt instruments 
as of january   the adoption of the new standard resulted in a cumulative transition adjustment of million to accumulated other comprehensive loss  a component of shareholders equity  and a corresponding liability of the same amount 
for the year ended december   the decrease in fair market value of our interest rate swaps was million and was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and other liabilities 
page on june   wri entered into two forward starting interest rate swap contracts with a notional amount of million 
these contracts were designated as a cash flow hedge of forecasted interest payments for million of unsecured notes with a coupon of that were sold on july  concurrent with the sale of the notes  we settled our million forward starting interest rate swap contracts  resulting in a gain of million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
this million gain is being amortized to earnings over the life of the notes 
on july   the company entered into eleven interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that convert fixed interest payments at rates from to to variable interest payments 
these interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges 
we have determined that these contracts will be highly effective in limiting our risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate notes attributable to changes in variable interest rates 
for the year ended december   the increase in fair market value of the eleven interest rate swaps was million and was recorded in other assets and fixed rate debt 
within the next twelve months  the company expects to reclassify to earnings as interest expense approximately million of the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
with respect to fair value hedges  both changes in fair market value of the derivative hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged item will be recorded in earnings each reporting period 
these amounts should completely offset with no impact to earnings  except for the portion of the hedge that proves to be ineffective  if any 
in july  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures 
this consensus requires that the proportionate share method of presenting balance sheet and income statement information for partnerships and other ventures in which entities have joint interest and control be discontinued  except in limited circumstances 
wri was required to conform to the guidance provided in this issue effective december  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to december  presented in this form k have been restated to conform to the revised presentation 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of a segment of a business 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements reflecting wri s expectations in the near term that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  however  many factors may materially affect the actual results  including demand for our properties  changes in rental and occupancy rates  changes in property operating costs  interest rate fluctuations  and changes in local and general economic conditions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that wri s expectations will be realized 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wri uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance its capital requirements 
these transactions expose wri to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose wri to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   wri had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps 
we also had variable rate notes receivable from joint venture partners totaling million at year end 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  net income  funds from operations and future cash flows would decrease million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december  page
