respiratory care products sales in fiscal of million were million  or less than sales of million in the prior year 
this decline in sales is the result of market share losses from continued production delays in the production of our b f disposable products which resulted in delayed shipments and other customer service issues 
these difficulties have led the company to move production of this product to the company s st 
louis facility during fiscal to improve service levels and reduce production cost 
medical gas equipment sales of million in fiscal were million  or below prior year levels of million 
the majority of this decline is due to a drop in international shipments from fiscal to fiscal international business is dependent upon hospital construction projects and the development of medical facilities in those regions in which the company operates

the company had a loss of million before taxes for fiscal  compared to income before taxes of million in fiscal the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  compared to tax expense of million in fiscal the tax benefit was negatively impacted due to the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge for federal income tax purposes

this increase is offset by a million decline in construction products resulting from the continued decline in the hospital construction market

inventory reduction programs did result in an additional million reduction in inventory 
accounts receivable decreased to million at june   down million from million at june  this decrease in accounts receivable is a result of decreased sales and an improvement in collection performance 
accounts receivable as measured in days sales outstanding dso decreased to dso at june  from dso at june  these working capital reductions are partially offset by the following working capital improvements during fiscal operating losses generated in fiscal led to a million income tax receivable at june   representing the federal income tax receivable resulting from the carry back of the fiscal loss  excluding the impact of the impairment of goodwill

on august   the company obtained a million mortgage loan on its principal facility in st 
louis  missouri with lasalle national bank association the bank 
under terms of this agreement the company makes monthly principal and interest payments  with a balloon payment in august proceeds of the loan were used to reduce the obligation under the revolving credit agreement with foothill capital corporation 
the mortgage loan carries a fixed rate of interest of  compared to the then current rate of under the revolving credit agreement 
on september   the company s credit facilities with foothill capital corporation foothill were amended 
the company s existing term loan was eliminated and replaced with an amended revolving credit facility 
as amended  the revolving credit facility remained at million 
the interest rate on the facility was reduced from the floating reference rate at june  plus to the floating reference rate plus 
the reference rate as defined in the credit agreement  was the variable rate of interest  per annum  most recently announced by wells fargo bank  national association  or any successor thereto  as its base rate 
this amendment also provided the company with a rate of libor 
amounts outstanding under this revolving credit facility  which expires on january   totaled million at june  at june   million was available under the revolving facility for additional borrowings based on working capital requirements under the terms of the agreement 
on april   the company entered into a new credit facility arrangement with the bank resulting in the payoff of all amounts due foothill 
the new credit facility provides for total borrowings up to million  consisting of up to million through a revolving credit facility and up to million under a term loan 
the term loan may be drawn against for capital expenditures during the first six months of the term of the credit facility 
repayment of the term loan begins on october   with principal and interest due in equal monthly installments over five years subject to payment in full at the maturity of the credit facility if that facility is not renewed or extended 
the new credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the maturity date of the new facility is april the revolving credit facility provides for a borrowing base of of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of of eligible inventory or million  subject to reserves as established by the bank 
at june   million was available under the revolving facility for additional borrowings based on working capital requirements under the terms of the agreement 
the revolving credit facility also provides for a commitment guaranty of up to million for letters of credit and requires a per annum fee of on outstanding letters of credit 
at june  the company had no letters of credit outstanding 
any outstanding letters of credit decreases the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
the entire credit facility accrues interest at the floating reference rate  which is the greater of the bank s prime rate plus if the company s fixed charge coverage ratio falls below to or the federal funds rate plus 
the floating reference rate was at june  the credit facility also provides the company with a rate of libor plus  at the company s option 
the optional libor rate may increase or decrease from libor plus to libor plus based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
at june   million of the revolving credit facility was subject to the libor provision 
the company also has the option to swap the interest rate applicable to the term loan for a fixed rate 
the new credit facility requires a lockbox arrangement  which provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
this arrangement combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the new credit facility  this arrangement causes the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability  per guidance in the fasb s emerging issues task force statement  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement eitf 
however  the company does not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the mae clause  which is a typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse effect on the operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
the classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two aforementioned factors the lockbox arrangement and the mae clause 
however  the revolving credit facility does not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather has a final expiration date of april  additionally  the bank has not notified the company of any indication of a mae at june  under the terms of the new credit facility  the company is required to be in compliance with certain financial covenants pertaining to stockholders equity  capital expenditures and net income 
at june   the company was in violation of its ebitda net income after taxes  plus interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization covenant  and its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  which were waived by the bank in a letter dated on september  proceeds of million received under the new credit facility were utilized to repay the entire amount outstanding under the company s previous revolving credit facility  which was thereby terminated 
the following table summarizes the company s cash obligations at june payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt    capital lease obligations   operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations assumes the company s revolving credit agreement currently classified as a current liability subject to the provisions of eitf will be paid at maturity 
capital expenditures  net of capital leases  were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to finance fixed payments and planned capital expenditures in cash flows from operations may be negatively impacted by decreases in sales  market conditions  and adverse changes in working capital 
inflation has not had a material effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company makes its foreign sales in dollars and  accordingly  sales proceeds are not affected by exchange rate fluctuations  although the effect on its customers does impact the pace of incoming orders 
seasonality and quarterly results in past fiscal years  the company has experienced moderate seasonal increases in net sales during its second and third fiscal quarters october through march which in turn have affected net income 
such seasonal variations were likely attributable to an increase in hospital equipment purchases at the beginning of each calendar year which coincides with many hospitals fiscal years and an increase in the severity of influenza during winter months 
the following table sets forth selected operating results for the eight quarters ended june  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited  but includes all normal recurring adjustments which the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
these operating results  however  are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
further  operating results may fluctuate as a result of the timing of orders  the company s product and customer mix  the introduction of new products by the company and its competitors  and overall trends in the health care industry and the economy 
while these patterns have an impact on the company s quarterly operations  the company is unable to predict the extent of this impact in any particular period

more specifically  there have been a number of lawsuits filed against the company alleging that its aluminum oxygen pressure regulator  marketed under its life support products label  has caused fires that have led to personal injury 
the company believes  based on preliminary findings  that its products did not cause the fires 
the company intends to defend these claims in cooperation with its insurers 
based on the progression of certain cases the company recorded additional charges to operations during fiscal for amounts estimated to be payable by the company under its self insurance retention for legal costs associated with defending these claims 
the company believes that any potential judgments resulting from these claims over its self insured retention will be covered by the company s product liability insurance

the company has also been testing regulator design with the help of the national aeronautical and space administration s white sands national laboratories 
while findings led the company to believe the company s products did not cause those fires  there was enough concern among the users that the company  in cooperation with the u 
s
