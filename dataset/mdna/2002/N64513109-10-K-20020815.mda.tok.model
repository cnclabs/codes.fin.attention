overview metron technology nv is a holding company organized under the laws of the netherlands 
through our various operating subsidiaries  we are a leading global provider of marketing  sales  service and support solutions to semiconductor materials and equipment suppliers and semiconductor manufacturers 
we operate in europe  asia except japan and the united states 
we were founded in europe in by our two corporate shareholders  who together owned approximately of our shares as of may   and by certain of our former management 
in  we reorganized metron to combine three asian companies as reorganization under common control  and purchased transpacific technology corporation ttc and its subsidiaries 
ttc was founded in california in as a semiconductor equipment manufacturers representative company and expanded into the equipment distribution business in in july  we acquired ta kyser co  which we refer to as kyser  in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
founded in  kyser markets and sells materials in nine states within the united states  principally to the semiconductor industry 
in march  we acquired shieldcare ltd  a company incorporated in scotland  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
shieldcare is an authorized supplier of critical parts cleaning services to major oem and device manufacturing companies worldwide 
the company also operates as an authorized re manufacturer of physical vapor deposition pvd equipment for a well known supplier of automated systems for chemical vapor deposition cvd 
effective november   we completed our acquisition of all the outstanding shares of intec technology s pte 
ltd  a privately held company incorporated in singapore 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and the results of operations of intec have been included in our consolidated financial statements from december  intec is a distributor of cleanroom products  and a manufacturer of cleanroom garments  and sells these products in singapore and malaysia 
in march  we purchased the ag associates rapid thermal processing rtp products from mattson technology 
in may  we acquired certain assets of advanced stainless technologies ast  a small texas based manufacturer of electro polished stainless steel tubing and fittings 
the transaction has been accounted for as a purchase 
we derive our revenue from sales of materials  equipment  service and spare parts to the semiconductor industry  as well as from commissions on sales of equipment and materials 
in general  we recognize revenue for most of an equipment sale and all other product sales upon the shipment of goods to customers 
we defer the portion of our equipment revenue associated with our installation and warranty obligations  and  depending on the terms of the sale  we sometimes defer also a portion of the sales price attributable to the equipment 
we recognize installation revenue  and any deferred equipment revenue  upon technical acceptance of the equipment by the customer s fab personnel  and we amortize the deferred warranty revenue over the applicable warranty period 
we recognize service revenue in the periods the services are rendered to customers 
in each of our three fiscal years ended may   a majority of our revenue came from the sale of products from five or fewer of the semiconductor materials and equipment companies we represent  who we refer to as our principals 
in fiscal  of our total revenue was generated from the sale of products manufactured by fsi  from the sale of products manufactured by entegris and from the sale of products manufactured by cabot microelectronics 
in august  cabot microelectronics advised us of its decision to assume the direct distribution of its products in europe and singapore  the effective date of the transition will be june  metron will continue to market cabot microelectronics products in israel 
in addition to representing two of our largest sources of revenue  fsi and entegris are also our two largest shareholders  holding and  respectively  of our outstanding shares 
although the principals that comprise our largest sources of revenue may change from period to period  we expect that revenue from the sale of products of a relatively small number of principals will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for at least the next five years 
on january  we entered into an agreement with entegris to modify our existing distribution relationship 
on february   we entered into a transition agreement with entegris whereby entegris assumed direct sales responsibility for products from its microelectronics group in europe beginning april   and in asia beginning may  we received revenue for orders received before the above dates and shipped within the days following these dates 
in addition  on march   we entered into a new distribution agreement with entegris  under which we will continue to distribute entegris fluid handling group product line in all regions in europe  asia  and parts of the united states covered under the previous distribution agreements 
the new distribution agreement will be in effect until august  revenue from products distributed for the microelectronics group under the previous distribution agreement for the years ended may   and were   and  respectively 
as consideration for modifying the existing distribution agreement  entegris transferred  shares of the metron common shares it owed to us  and agreed to make cash payments totaling  over a month period 
we will record a gain on the modification of  this gain will be recognized on a straight line basis as other operating income over the period from the date of the modification  february  until august   which represents the remaining effective term of the original agreement 
the common shares transferred by entegris represented  of the gain  which was equal to their fair market value on february  we operate in all areas of the world in which there is a significant semiconductor industry  except japan 
the following tables show our sales in europe  asia and the united states in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue for each of the three fiscal years ended may   and year ended may  in thousands net revenue europe    asia    united states    total net revenue    year ended may  percentage of net revenue net revenue europe asia united states total net revenue we are organized into two worldwide operating divisions  equipment and materials 
our equipment division derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of capital equipment 
the remainder of the division s revenue comes from service  which includes the installation  maintenance and repair of semiconductor equipment  spare part sales and commissions 
with the acquisition of shieldcare  and later of the ag associates rtp products  we added new revenue categories  revenue from the cleaning of shields used in the manufacturing of semiconductors and revenue from the sale of legacy equipment that we manufacture ourselves 
our equipment sales represent products that support various production activities for the manufacture of semiconductors 
the sales of the equipment division principally represent a small number of high dollar value transactions 
in the majority of cases where the equipment is externally sourced  ie is manufactured by one of our principals  the equipment is shipped directly to the customer by the manufacturer 
as a result  our equipment sales are significantly affected by the pattern of capital spending by customers  the timing of customer orders  the timing of product shipments by the equipment manufacturer  and the timing of customer acceptances 
our materials division derives the majority of its revenue from sales of materials and components 
the remainder of the division s revenue comes from commissions 
the materials and components we sell are used both in the production of semiconductors and in the building and maintenance of semiconductor equipment and manufacturing facilities 
materials include products such as wafer surface preparation materials  fluid handling components such as fittings  valves and tubing  and disposable cleanroom clothing 
sales of these products tend to be less cyclical than sales of semiconductor equipment and generally offer higher gross margins than externally sourced equipment 
critical accounting policies and estimates metron s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
metron bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
together these form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which was adopted by the company as of june  we have adopted specific and detailed guidelines for recognizing revenue 
nevertheless  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
most equipment sales are recorded as multiple element transactions in which the portion of the sale represented by the fair value of future installation and warranty services is deferred  and only the residual amount of the sale representing the equipment itself is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
in certain circumstances  depending on the precise terms of the transaction  we also defer a portion of the residual amount attributable to the equipment itself 
the installation and warranty revenue we defer for each machine sold requires us to estimate the amount of time we expect it to take to install the equipment and to maintain the equipment during the warranty period 
the estimated time is valued using the fair value of our service rates in each country 
we review the adequacy of our estimates periodically and revise them as necessary 
we recognize deferred installation revenue  and deferred equipment revenue  if any  when the customer accepts the equipment as production enabled in the fab 
we recognize deferred warranty revenue ratably over the warranty period 
valuation accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on our historical experience and our current assessment of the credit worthiness of specific customers 
the reserves are re evaluated and adjusted at each balance sheet date as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company analyzes the composition of its inventory and identifies and evaluates slow moving inventory to determine if reserves are required 
estimated required reserves are based on past usage and on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
goodwill and intangibles 
as a result of some of our business acquisitions  we have recorded approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and the lives of technology 
during fiscal  we amortized million of goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective on june  goodwill will no longer be amortized with the adoption of sfas in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill using a two step test 
the initial step is to identify any potential impairment in the first half of fiscal the second step measures the impairment loss  if any  and must be completed by the end of fiscal an impairment review of goodwill will be performed annually thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first six months of fiscal until the review is completed  we will not know for certain whether or not we will need to record an impairment charge  or whether such charge  if any  will be material 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process may result in the recording of deferred tax assets which represent temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and financial statement amounts reported by each subsidiary  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the recoverability of tax assets based on our ability to carryback the temporary differences to recover taxes previously paid  if any  or our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the relevant tax jurisdiction 
if we determine the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is in doubt  we record a valuation allowance 
we regularly update our estimate of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  and these updates can result in changes in the valuation allowance 
results of operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal the semiconductor industry began to recover from the slowdown that began in the second half of the recovery continued through fiscal  and we returned to profitability 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to experience order cancellations  delays in booking new orders and delays in shipping orders to customers  all of which contributed to the significant reduction in our revenue in fiscal this directly affected the sales of semiconductor capital equipment and the sales of materials 
as a result of the decline in revenues  we recorded operating losses during the second and third quarters of fiscal while operations were slightly positive in our fourth quarter  we experienced an operating loss for fiscal as a whole 
we believe that  despite short term slowdowns  the semiconductor industry has long term growth opportunities 
as a result  we believe we must maintain our infrastructure  even during periodic slowdowns  in order to continue to serve our customers and to be in a position to take advantage of long term growth opportunities 
accordingly  we did not reduce our operating expenses sufficiently to prevent us from recording an operating loss in fiscal we expect that revenues for the first quarter of fiscal will be higher than our revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal years indicated 
the historical financial data for fiscal  and were derived from  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fiscal year ended may  net revenue cost of revenue gross margin selling  general  administrative and other expenses other operating income  net of associated costs restructuring and merger costs operating margin loss the following table shows our materials division and equipment division revenue as a percent of net revenue  together with the related gross margins fiscal year ended may  net revenue equipment division materials division gross margins equipment division materials division net revenue equipment division 
the equipment division s net revenue in fiscal was million  down million  or  from million in fiscal our fiscal equipment division revenue was up million  or  from million in fiscal equipment division revenue grew during fiscal in all geographic regions  with particularly strong growth in europe and the united states 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we began to experience a severe slowdown 
which continued until the third quarter of fiscal despite a modest sequential increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  for the fiscal year as a whole we experienced significant revenue reductions in all geographic regions  particularly in europe 
materials division 
the materials division s net revenue in fiscal was million  down million  or  from million in fiscal the materials division s net revenue in fiscal was up million  or  from million in fiscal revenue grew sequentially from the two year low in the first quarter of fiscal  when the industry began to emerge from its prolonged downturn  and continued to grow through the third quarter of fiscal in all geographic regions 
as with the equipment division  we experienced a severe slowdown beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing until the third quarter of fiscal despite a sequential increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which were only below the revenues reported in the first quarter  for the fiscal year as a whole we experienced significant revenue reductions in all geographic regions  particularly in europe 
gross margins equipment division 
gross margins in the equipment division increased by basis points in fiscal margins improved in all revenue categories  with the majority of the increase coming from service and spare parts 
service margins improved as a result of the recognition of installation revenues deferred from earlier periods 
commissions  which have no associated cost of goods sold  also contributed to the margin improvement because they represented a higher proportion of division revenue in fiscal than in fiscal equipment division gross margins for fiscal declined by basis points when compared to fiscal the decline was due primarily to the smaller proportion of sales represented by spare parts revenues in fiscal and to the start up costs of new parts cleaning facilities in israel and singapore 
materials division 
gross margins in the materials division declined basis points in fiscal while product margins remained essentially flat  warehousing costs increased on a relative basis  which  coupled with a reduction in commission revenue  resulted in lower overall margins 
gross margins in the materials division in fiscal were essentially unchanged from fiscal selling  general  administrative and other sg a expenses 
sg a expenses in fiscal were million  down million  or  from fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal were million  up million  or  from fiscal our acquisition of intec accounted for million and million of sg a in fiscal and  respectively 
sg a expenses consist principally of salaries and other employment related costs  occupancy costs  travel and entertainment  communications and computer related expense  trade show and professional services  depreciation and amortization of acquisition goodwill 
our sg a expenses are a function principally of our total headcount 
almost of our operating expenses consist of salaries and other employment related costs 
the decrease in sg a expense in fiscal was due principally to lower personnel expenses amounting to million  which includes incentive plans and bonuses  and lower travel and entertainment expense amounting to million 
in the fourth quarter  we succeeded in substantially reducing the amount of receivables that were over days 
consequently  we reduced our provision for doubtful accounts by million 
the increase in sg a expenses in fiscal was primarily due to increases in headcount  travel and incentive plan expense 
in addition  in fiscal  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of the increase in the level of our accounts receivable  the proportion of our accounts receivable which were not being paid in accordance with agreed terms and the deteriorating short term outlook for the industry 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs of million incurred during fiscal comprise termination costs of million for a reduction in head count of employees and abandonment of a lease amounting to million 
of the reduction in headcount totaling employees  worked in the equipment division  in the materials division and in finance and administration 
restructuring costs of million incurred during fiscal represent the costs of an abandoned leasehold in the united states 
this cost represents the estimated difference between the total discounted future sublease income and our lease commitments relating to this space 
the charge is an estimate and may be adjusted if we obtain a sublease for the space and the actual sublease income is significantly different from the estimate 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take an additional charge for the balance of the future lease cost 
at may   no liability remained for the termination costs  and the liability pertaining to the abandoned leasehold was approximately million 
other operating income  net of associated costs 
on january   we entered into an agreement with entegris to modify our existing distribution relationship 
on february   we entered into a transition agreement with entegris whereby entegris assumed direct sales responsibility for products from its microelectronics group in europe beginning april   and in asia beginning may  on march   we entered into a new distribution agreement with entegris  under which we continue to distribute entegris fluid handling group product line in all regions in europe  asia and parts of the united states covered under the previous distribution agreements 
the new distribution agreement will be in effect until august  as consideration for modifying the existing distribution agreement  entegris transferred  of the metron common shares it owed to us and agreed to make cash payments totaling million over a month period 
the total gain of million is being recognized on a straight line basis as other operating income over the period from the date of the modification  february   until august   which represents the remaining effective term of the original agreement 
the common shares transferred by entegris represented million of the gain  which was equal to their fair market value on february  loss from impairment of investment 
during fiscal  we recorded a loss of million for an estimated other than temporary impairment in the value of our investments in advanced stainless technologies  inc ast  and abeto gmbh abeto 
million of the loss was recorded against our equity investment in ast  a texas based manufacturer of specialty stainless steel tubing 
the remainder of the loss pertained to abeto  an investment we made in may abeto was established in september as a spin off from infineon technologies ag to provide outsource services in the reclaim and refurbishment of packaging materials for the semiconductor industry 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we assessed abeto s ability to continue as a going concern without additional financial support  and in the fourth quarter  as a result of our assessment  we recorded an impairment loss of million 
other income expense 
the following table summarizes the components of other income expense 
year ended may  in thousands foreign exchange gain loss interest income  interest expense    other income other income expense we engage in limited hedging activities to reduce our exposure to exchange risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency  but because hedging activities can be costly  we do not attempt to cover all potential foreign currency exposures 
during the three year period ended may   we entered into contracts to hedge firm purchase commitments  to hedge the maturities of foreign currency denominated liabilities with foreign currency denominated assets and to hedge differences existing between foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the currencies in which we purchase forward exchange contracts have numerous market makers to provide ample depth and liquidity for our hedging activities 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we had an exchange loss of million  which was primarily the result of the sudden and significant appreciation of the euro against the united states dollar in december interest income represents primarily earnings on our available cash balances 
the decrease in our interest income in fiscal is a result of lower average cash balances and of declining interest rates 
the decrease in fiscal represents utilization of our short term investments for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
interest income for fiscal represents primarily interest earned from the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering in short term investments 
interest expense for fiscal decreased primarily due to a reduction of interest rates 
our interest expense for fiscal increased primarily as the result of increased borrowings to support the increased working capital requirements associated with higher revenues 
other income for fiscal and consisted of various miscellaneous non operating income 
in fiscal other income consisted of various miscellaneous income  and the proceeds from the exercise and sale of stock warrants held in a non related principal 
provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 
the effective rate was lower than the netherlands statutory tax rate of  primarily because of non deductible losses in asia  and tax losses in asia for which we recorded a valuation allowance  which eliminates any benefit to our effective tax rate 
in fiscal  our effective income rate was 
the effective rate was higher than the netherlands statutory tax rate of  primarily because of higher tax rates in countries other than the netherlands where we do business  and non deductible losses in asia 
in fiscal  our effective income tax rate was 
the rate was higher than the netherlands statutory tax rate primarily due to an additional assessment in germany stemming from the restructuring in fiscal of our german subsidiary s italian branch  and an increase in goodwill amortization  a non deductible expense  which resulted from our acquisition of shieldcare 
liquidity and capital resources we define liquidity as our ability to generate resources to pay our current obligations and to finance our growth during periods of business expansion 
our principal requirement for capital is for working capital to finance receivables and inventories  and to a lesser extent to fund major capital expenditures such as parts cleaning facilities 
until we completed our initial public offering in late november  our principal sources of liquidity were cash flow from operations and bank borrowings 
our working capital  current assets less current liabilities  at may  was million compared to million at may  our current ratio  current assets divided by current liabilities  was at may  and at may  operating activities 
cash flows generated by operating activities in fiscal were million  which represents a million decline from fiscal our net loss plus non cash items included in net loss totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal changes in assets and liabilities due to a substantial decrease in receivables  the reduction of inventories  partially offset by the reductions in payables generated million in cash 
the cash generated by changes in assets and liabilities more than offset the net loss plus non cash items 
cash flows generated by operating activities in fiscal were million  which represents an million improvement from fiscal net income plus non cash items included in net income totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal changes in assets and liabilities absorbed million in fiscal  changes in receivables and inventories offset by increases in payables absorbed million  reflecting higher sales in fiscal and the fact that our customers generally did not pay us as promptly as we are required to pay our suppliers 
the comparable amounts in fiscal were  changes in assets and liabilities million  changes in receivables and inventories offset by increases in payables million 
investing activities 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million for fiscal  up from million for the same period in fiscal we spent approximately million in fiscal to build our new parts cleaning facility in the netherlands and to improve our facility in scotland  and we invested million in our new operations management information system 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  of which million pertains to our new operations management information system 
we estimate that the total costs of the new management information system will be to million over an approximately to month period 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million for fiscal  up from million for the same period in fiscal we spent approximately million in fiscal to build our new parts cleaning facilities in singapore and israel  and we invested million in our new operations management information system 
we invested million for an approximately interest in advanced stainless technologies  inc ast  a texas based manufacturer of electro polished stainless steel tubes and fittings for ultra high purity systems 
in fiscal  we invested million from the proceeds of our initial public offering to purchase short term investments  and received million from the sale of those investments 
we invested million of net cash to acquire all the common shares of shieldcare ltd  and invested million in abeto gmbh 
abeto was established in september as a spin off from infineon technologies ag to provide outsource services in the reclaim and refurbishment of packaging materials for the semiconductor industry 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million for fiscal representing expenditures for leasehold improvements  computer and communications equipment 
financing activities 
equity 
in fiscal  we received million from employees for the purchase of approximately  common shares through our employee stock purchase plan  and approximately  common shares from the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  the company received million from employees for the purchase of approximately  common shares through its employee stock purchase plan  and  common shares from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
in fiscal  we completed our initial public offering with the issuance of  common shares  and received net proceeds of million 
in fiscal  we also received million from the exercise of stock options by our employees 
debt 
in fiscal  we increased our long term debt by million  principally as a result of the acquisition of the assets of ast 
in fiscal  we increased our credit facilities to keep pace with increased revenues  and increased our short term borrowings by million 
current and future position 
as of may   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term borrowings under its various lines of credit 
we believe that these funds  combined with currently available lines of credit and expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs for fiscal at current operating levels 
however  if quarterly revenues increase materially  we will need to raise additional working capital from external sources to permit us to conduct our operations in the ordinary course of business through fiscal while we currently expect to be able to raise additional working capital to support increased revenues  we cannot give any assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
our current lines of credit are typically subject to periodic  generally annual  review  and we cannot give any assurance that our lenders will agree to renew these facilities on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
lenders might base a decision not to renew on general industry conditions without regard to our financial performance 
in the event that our current lenders decide not to renew our current facilities  we believe that we would have access to alternate sources to enable us to meet the company s cash needs for fiscal as of may   we were in violation of covenants to maintain specified interest coverage ratios on our building mortgage and on a small credit facility in the netherlands 
to resolve these issues  in june  we repaid our building mortgage  and  in july  we repaid a portion of our borrowing on the credit facility to reduce our borrowing to the newly agreed lower facility limit 
with the exception of the reduced approximately million credit facility in the netherlands  as to which we do not expect to meet the interest coverage covenant at august   we believe that we will be able to renew our various lines of credit as they expire  and expand them as necessary 
certain of our credit facilities contain other covenants that require us to meet or maintain certain minimum ratios  but we expect to meet all such other financial covenants 
in addition  our ability to generate our anticipated cash flow from operations is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed under item i 
part risks related to metron 
this includes  in particular  our dependence upon a few key principals and a relatively small number of customers for a majority of our revenue  variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products and collect accounts receivable and in the timing of customer orders and risks associated with the semiconductor industry and its periodic downturns 
we also intend to seek additional financing during the next twelve months to meet the company s working capital requirements for fiscal any inability on our part to renew and expand our existing credit facilities or to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other sources could result in the company not achieving its longer term business objectives 
we may need to raise additional capital through public or private sales of equity and or additional borrowings for significant acquisitions  significant capital expenditures or other extraordinary transactions 
we do not currently have any specific plans  agreements or commitments related to any such significant transaction and are not currently engaged in any negotiations related to any such transaction 
we have no plans to pay any dividends on our common shares and intend to retain all of our future profits to fund future growth 
if we cannot raise additional funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop our business  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  all of which could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
the issuance of additional equity or debt securities convertible into equity could result in dilution to our existing shareholders 
in july  in order to give ourselves additional financing flexibility  we filed a shelf registration statement covering up to million of common shares 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources are expected to be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement 
this statement involves known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our  or our industry s  actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
these factors are listed under item i 
part risks related to metron and elsewhere in this annual report on form k

at may   and  amounts receivable from these affiliates were million and million  respectively 
in july  an officer managing director of metron entered into a tax indemnification agreement tia with the company as part of its acquisition of transpacific technology corporation 
at the time of the acquisition and until it completed its initial public offering in november  metron was a controlled foreign corporation under subpart f of the us internal revenue code subpart f  and as a us person the officer director was liable for personal income tax on income imputed to him under subpart f 
under the agreement  the company has provided cash advances for taxes due for subpart f income that totaled million 
under the tia  the officer managing director is required to repay these advances only to the extent that he benefits from the increase in the tax basis of his holding of metron stock 
accordingly  in fiscal  the company recorded a reserve of million against these advances 
repayment of a portion of the advances is required beginning with the first sale of shares owned by the officer director 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ta kyser co  we assumed a note from a shareholder for purchase of retired treasury shares 
the note had a remaining balance of million at may   an annual interest rate of and was paid in july bank borrowing facilities the following table summarizes our material borrowing facilities as of may  lender us equivalent facility amount amount currently outstanding amount available recent interest rate dollars in thousands compass bank   royal bank of scotland   deutsche bank   ing bank   all others    to total    in june  the company s singapore subsidiary obtained an additional million revolving credit facility with an interest rate based on the bank prime rate plus 
as of july  the ing bank facility has been reduced to the equivalent of million euros or million us dollars 
effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risk management a significant portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states through our foreign subsidiaries 
while most of our international sales are denominated in united states dollars  some are denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
owing to the number of currencies involved  the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  and our constantly changing currency exposures  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we engage in foreign currency hedging transactions from time to time  these hedging transactions can be costly  and therefore  we do not attempt to cover all potential foreign currency exposures 
these hedging techniques do not eliminate all of the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on anticipated revenue
