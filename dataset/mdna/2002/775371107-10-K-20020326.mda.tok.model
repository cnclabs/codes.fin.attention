item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to financial statements for the years ended december   and same business basis as it relates to the comparison of sales between reporting periods includes only those businesses  segments or divisions that have been in place during the entire reportable period 
earnings losses from continuing operations before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of accounting change are abbreviated as earnings losses from continuing operations within the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant items affecting  and results of operations in january  the company acquired learonal  an electronic materials business and in june of  morton 
details of these transactions are discussed under liquidity  capital resources and other financial data below 
the results of these significant acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition 
unaudited pro forma information is presented in the table on page the learonal and morton acquisitions  accounted for using the purchase method  significantly impacted the comparability of and results 
accordingly  pro forma sales and earnings excluding non recurring items are provided in the results of operations discussions to facilitate comparisons 
the pro forma results include morton and learonal as if these significant acquisitions had occurred on january  pro forma adjustments were made primarily to reflect increased goodwill and intangible amortization and interest expense 
cost savings from integration efforts were not reflected 
though useful for comparison  pro forma results are not intended to reflect actual earnings had the acquisitions occurred on the dates indicated and are not a projection of future results or trends 
pro forma information is not presented for other acquisition and divestiture activities occurring in  and because these were not material to the company s results of operations or consolidated financial position 
non recurring items non recurring items represent gains or losses arising from events or transactions that are unusual in nature  occur infrequently or satisfy the definition of an extraordinary item in accordance with accounting principles board apb reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
unless otherwise indicated  the impact of non recurring items on operations within the context of the management s discussion and analysis is stated net of tax 
sale of the agricultural chemicals business following the sale of its agricultural chemicals business ag in june  the company reported the operating results as discontinued operations in accordance with apb reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
agricultural chemicals had been a separate major line of business in the chemical specialties segment 
the operating results of ag have been reported separately as discontinued operations in prior years 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
o litigation and environmental reserves the company is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
the company also expends significant funds for environmental remediation of both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  specifically statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  the company records a loss and establishes a reserve for litigation or remediation when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability exists and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demands  or settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  estimates performed by independent engineering companies and outside counsel  available facts  existing and proposed technology  the identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
however  the reserves may materially differ from ultimate actual liabilities if the loss contingency is difficult to estimate or if management s judgments turn out to be inaccurate 
if management believes no best estimate exists  the minimum loss is accrued in accordance with gaap 
o restructuring in june  the company recorded a million restructuring and asset impairment charge in connection with its repositioning efforts  of which million represented restructuring charges 
the repositioning effort consisted of separate initiatives affecting all business groups across the company  and will take approximately twelve months to complete from date of commencement 
the million of restructuring included million of severance termination benefits for  employees affected by plant closings or capacity reductions  as well as various personnel in corporate  administrative and shared service functions 
severance termination benefits were based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions and salary levels 
management estimated the restructuring charge based on these factors as well as projected final service dates 
given the complexity of estimates and broad reaching scope of the repositioning effort  actual expenses could differ from management s estimates 
if actual results are different from original estimates  the company will record additional expense or reverse previously recorded expense through the provision for restructuring and asset impairment line in the statement of consolidated earnings 
as of december   the company recognized a favorable change to the original estimate of million  due in part to changes in estimates for severance expense and the recognition of settlement gains 
management will continue to make adjustments if necessary as actions under the plan are carried out 
o valuation of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in conjunction with the company s repositioning efforts  million in assets were deemed impaired and written off based on estimated fair value assumptions 
fair values are estimated based upon forecasted cash flows discounted to present value 
if actual cash flows or discount rate estimates change  the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependant on the performance of the company s investees  as well as volatility inherent in their external markets 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments the company will consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of its investees 
if these forecasts are not met  the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
o pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefits 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  lower levels of pension credit or other additional expense may be required 
see notes and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assumptions used by the company 
o inventory reserves the company adjusts the value of its obsolete and unmarketable inventory to the estimated market value based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o gain on sale of the agricultural chemicals business in june  the company completed the sale of its agricultural chemicals business to dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned subsidiary of the dow chemical company for approximately billion  subject to a working capital adjustment 
the working capital adjustment has not been finalized as of december  the company has recorded a receivable from das for the amount of the working capital adjustment based upon management s best estimate of the ultimate adjustment 
the company s calculation of the working capital adjustment required estimates related to the valuation of certain assets  principally accounts receivable  inventory  and rebate liabilities transferred to das on june  if the final working capital adjustment differs from management s estimate as of december   the company will be required to record an adjustment to the gain on disposal of discontinued line of business initially recorded in the second quarter of consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net sales consolidated net sales in were  million  below net sales of  million 
the decrease from the prior year was driven by persistently weak global demand across all businesses 
net sales compared to the prior year declined for electronic materials  which has been buffeted by a precipitous industry wide decline since april  for performance polymers on lower volumes and for chemical specialties due to persistent sluggishness in the paper and industrial markets served by the businesses in this group 
salt sales  on a same business basis  remained flat as both periods benefited from strong demand for highway ice control products in the winter season 
in the fourth quarter of  the company sold its european salt business 
net earnings net earnings as reported for the year were million  a increase from net earnings of million 
earnings per share on a diluted basis were in  compared with per share in the company reported a loss from continuing operations for the year of million or per common share  compared to income from continuing operations of million or per common share in net income excluding non recurring items for the year was million  or less than earnings of million 
the year over year decline can be attributed to the impact of poor external economic conditions on all business segments  particularly electronic materials and performance polymers which accounted for million  or  of the total decline from the company actively managed through the economic downturn to mitigate significantly reduced demand by announcing and implementing restructuring initiatives to bring capacity more in line with market demand 
expenditures continued to be made on research and development  enterprise resource planning erp initiatives and small acquisitions in adhesives and sealants 
in june  the company completed the sale of ag to dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned subsidiary of the dow chemical company  for approximately billion  subject to a working capital adjustment not yet finalized at december  the company recorded a gain on the sale in the amount of million pre tax million or per share after tax 
income from discontinued operations  prior to the june sale  was million or per share after tax as compared to income from discontinued operations in of million or per common share after tax 
the impact of non recurring items on earnings from continuing operations in was a charge of million and consisted primarily of million of restructuring and asset impairment charges  million of costs associated with the repositioning efforts including plant shutdown and dismantlement costs  million of asset valuation adjustments in the electronic materials segment  and million of remediation related charges  net of insurance settlements 
the impact of non recurring charges on earnings from continuing operations in was million  and consisted of million of purchased in process research and development ipr d and other one time charges related to the rodel acquisition and million of costs associated with restructuring and integration efforts 
refer to the following table for a reconciliation of reported earnings to earnings excluding non recurring items for all years presented 
table of non recurring items in millions net earnings as reported non recurring gains losses ipr d and other one time charges related to acquisitions joint venture dispositions remediation related charges  net of insurance settlements provision for restructuring and asset impairments asset write downs  integration and other restructuring costs impact on continuing operations income from discontinued line of business gain on disposal of discontinued line of business discontinued operations extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt cumulative effect of accounting change total non recurring gains losses earnings excluding non recurring items gross profit gross profit for was  million  a decline from  million in and the gross profit margin was  down from in the change in gross profit margin is primarily the result of lower manufacturing efficiency driven by reduced demand 
the company continues to respond by maintaining price increases and improving internal efficiencies 
selling  administrative and research sar expenses sar expenses were  million for  a decrease from  million in  reflecting savings from the company s repositioning efforts as well as a decrease in employee related expenses 
these cost reductions were offset by increased research and development costs reflecting the company s continued focus on developing cutting edge technologies and erp information system expenditures 
sar expenses were of net sales for  compared to in purchased in process research and development ipr d ipr d in acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method  represents the value assigned to research and development projects of an acquired company where technological feasibility had not yet been established at the date of the acquisition  and which  if unsuccessful  have no alternative future use 
amounts assigned to ipr d are charged to expense at the date of acquisition 
accordingly  the company charged million to expense in in connection with the rodel acquisition 
see note purchased in process research and development in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense for was million  a decline from million in  primarily due to lower debt levels and interest rates as compared to the prior year period 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for was million  a decline from million in share of affiliate net earnings share of affiliate net earnings in was million  a decline from earnings of million in  primarily due to the increased ownership in rodel and the sale of affiliates related to the disposition of ag see note acquisitions and dispositions of assets in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to march  the investment in rodel was accounted for under the equity method with the company s share of earnings reported as equity in affiliates 
since the second quarter of  rodel s results of operations have been fully consolidated 
provision for restructuring provision for restructuring of million pre tax or million after tax for the year ended december  is comprised primarily of asset impairment and restructuring charges relating to the company s repositioning initiatives that commenced in june the company recognized a million one time restructuring and asset impairment charge in the second quarter of  to enable several of its businesses to respond to structural changes in the global marketplace 
the largest component related to the partial closure of certain manufacturing and research facilities across all business groups and included exit costs related to the liquid polysulfide sealants business in performance polymers and part of the dyes business in chemical specialties 
approximately of the assets impaired were in the north american region 
the one time charge included severance benefits  the employees receiving severance benefits will include those affected by plant closings or capacity reductions  as well as various personnel in corporate  administrative and shared service functions 
approximately  positions will be affected by the restructuring efforts 
offsetting the original charge of million recorded in june  is a pre tax gain of million from the recognition of settlement gains and changes in estimates to restructuring liabilities established for the initiatives  as well as a pre tax gain of million from changes in estimates to restructuring liabilities established in it is the company s policy to recognize settlement gains at the time an employee s pension liability is settled 
in the first half of  a restructuring reserve of million pre tax was recorded in the ion exchange resins business for the write down of plant assets and severance costs for approximately people 
these charges were net of certain pension settlement and curtailment gains 
other income other income for was million  a decline from million in the decline is primarily due to lower foreign currency gains compared to the prior year 
in addition  the company incurred a million casualty loss resulting from a fire at a joint venture manufacturing facility 
effective tax rate the loss from continuing operations of million contains million of income taxes  which computes to a effective tax rate 
this reflects the impact of a tax rate on the million loss provision for restructuring and asset impairment  which included non deductible restructuring expenses 
excluding the impact of this provision  the effective tax rate on continuing operations was  the same as the effective tax rate for  excluding non tax deductible ipr d charges was 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales in were  million  a increase from pro forma net sales of  million and a increase from actual net sales of  million 
the increase from pro forma net sales was driven largely by an acquisition driven sales increase in the electronic materials segment and to a lesser extent the acquisition of of acima ag acima in the chemical specialties segment 
the effect of these acquisitions was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts 
net earnings net earnings on an as reported basis for were million  a increase from net earnings of million 
diluted earnings per common share were in compared to in earnings from continuing operations for the year were million or per diluted common share  compared to million or per diluted common share in net earnings excluding non recurring items for the year were million  a decline from pro forma and an decline from actual net earnings excluding non recurring items 
earnings per share excluding non recurring items on a diluted basis was in  compared with per share in actual the impact of the non recurring charges on continuing operations in was million  and consisted of million of ipr d and other one time charges related to the rodel acquisition  and million of costs associated with the restructuring and integration efforts 
non recurring items impacting continuing operations for include charges of million  including a charge of million for ipr d and other one time charges from the morton acquisition  a charge of million for restructuring costs resulting both from the integration of morton and the company s redesign of its selling and administrative infrastructure  million related to asset write downs  integration and other restructuring costs  a gain of million from remediation related insurance recoveries  and a million loss on disposition of the atohaas joint venture 
the operating results of ag have been reported separately as discontinued operations in prior years 
income from discontinued operations in was million or per share as compared to income from discontinued operations in of million or per common share 
gross profit gross profit for the year was  million  an increase from  million in  however  the gross profit margin was in  down from from the change in gross profit margin was primarily the result of increased hydrocarbon based raw material prices in addition to higher energy costs in the form of higher natural gas prices and increased freight costs due to higher fuel prices 
the impact of increased raw material prices was primarily in the performance polymers business segment 
overall raw material price increases were not offset by overall selling price increases 
to a lesser extent  higher depreciation resulting from fair values being assigned to acquired assets also contributed to the change in gross profit margin 
selling  administrative and research sar expenses sar expenses for decreased to of net sales from in in  the company began implementing a redesign of its selling and administrative infrastructure and instituted other cost saving measures associated with the integration of the morton and learonal acquisitions 
the stated goal of these efforts was to reduce annual procurement  sar and other expenses by million 
by year end  the run rate goal was achieved through cost reductions in support services  procurement and manufacturing 
purchased in process research and development ipr d ipr d in acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method  represents the value assigned to research and development projects of an acquired company where technological feasibility had not yet been established at the date of the acquisition  and which  if unsuccessful  have no alternative future use 
amounts assigned to ipr d were charged to expense at the date of acquisition 
accordingly  the company charged million and million to expense in and  respectively  related to the rodel and morton acquisitions see note purchased in process research and development in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense in was million  a increase from million in  due to higher debt levels resulting from acquisitions 
in year a full year of interest at the higher debt levels is reflected versus six months in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization in was million  a increase from million in the increase was attributable to significant acquisitions and year reflects amortization for a full year versus six months in related to these acquisitions 
share of affiliate net earnings earnings of million in increased from earnings of million in the earnings resulted from a full year of affiliates acquired in mid and from earnings of certain affiliated businesses of rodel 
since the second quarter of  rodel s results of operations have been fully consolidated 
the earnings resulted largely from rodel  which was an affiliate during that year 
other income other income for was million  a million increase from million in the increase is largely from foreign currency gains resulting from risk management activities 
the period includes morton integration costs offset by a gain related to a favorable settlement with insurance carriers over certain environmental remediation matters 
effective tax rate the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for was  largely as a result of the non deductible write off of ipr d 
excluding the non tax deductible ipr d charges  the effective tax rate was for both years 
rates also reflect the effect of certain non tax deductible amortization charges resulting from the company s acquisition activities

see management s discussion and analysis performance polymers versus performance polymers sales for were  million  a decline from  million in sales and earnings decreases were felt in all businesses primarily due to poor external economic conditions and as a result of the continued slow down in the building and construction industry which are served largely by the coatings  adhesives and sealants and plastic additives businesses 
automotive and powder coatings sales decreased primarily due to weak demand in the automotive and industrial markets  as compared to the prior year 
earnings from continuing operations for were million  a decline from million in excluding non recurring items  earnings were million  an decline from earnings of million 
versus performance polymers sales for were  million  a decrease of from  million pro forma sales and a increase from actual sales of  million in earnings from continuing operations for were million  a decline from million in excluding non recurring items  earnings were million in  a decrease from pro forma earnings of million and a decrease from million in sales and earnings in the year were impacted by an economic slowing in the us building and construction markets in the second half of these markets are served largely by the coatings  adhesives and sealants and plastics additives businesses 
similar slowing in the automotive markets served by surface finishes was also a factor 
sales were also affected by weaker european currencies 
the decrease in earnings  excluding non recurring items  was a result of these demand factors and by sharply higher hydrocarbon base raw material costs and energy costs  particularly natural gas see gross profit discussion under summary of consolidated results below 
the monomer business continued to report strong growth in the year as a result of the acquired stockhausen merchant monomer business in europe 
among the surface finishes businesses  sales of powder coatings on a pro forma basis continued to improve  but were offset by weaker sales in automotive coatings driven by slowing in the us automotive markets 
chemical specialties versus chemical specialties reported sales of million  a decline from million in inorganic and specialty solutions sales decreased by million  representing of the total year over year decline  as the business continues to suffer from persistently low demand for sodium borohydride related applications in the newsprint  pharmaceutical and electronic markets 
consumer and industrial specialties sales declined million from  representing of the total decline as a result of decreased demand in industrial markets 
ion exchange resins sales declined due to a weakness in industrial water treatment and catalyst markets 
earnings from continuing operations for were million  an decline from million in earnings for  excluding non recurring items were million  a decline from million in as lower demand produced higher manufacturing variances  which negatively impacted earnings 
versus chemical specialties sales for were million  a increase from pro forma sales of million and a increase from actual sales of million in sales increases were driven by consumer and industrial specialties  helped by the acquired acima biocides business  with a contribution from ion exchange resins 
earnings from continuing operations for were million  a decline from million in net earnings  excluding non recurring items  were million in  a decline from pro forma earnings of million and a decline from actual earnings of million in electronic materials versus electronic materials sales were million  a decline from  million in the sales decline was driven by a significant decrease in demand across all businesses  with the exception of sophisticated technologies including deep uv photoresists  chemical mechanical planarization products and anti reflective coatings 
earnings from continuing operations for were million compared to million in  reflecting costs associated with the company s repositioning efforts 
excluding non recurring items  earnings were million  a decline from million in  because of significantly decreased demand impacting manufacturing efficiencies 
versus electronic materials sales for were  million  a increase from pro forma sales of million and a increase from actual sales of million in earnings from continuing operations for were million  a increase from pro forma of million and a increase from million in excluding non recurring items  earnings were million in  a increase from million in increases in sales and earnings were evident in all regions and markets within the electronic materials segment due to continued demand for new technologies and contributions from rodel  which was consolidated in  and from shipley ronal  part of which was acquired in results of operations for rodel were consolidated during the second quarter of  as a result of increasing the company s ownership to approximately from 
salt versus salt sales were million for  a decline from million in sales  on a same business basis  remained unchanged from the prior period 
earnings from continuing operations for were million  a decline from million in the company sold its european salt business in the fourth quarter of see note acquisitions and dispositions of assets in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding non recurring items  earnings remained constant at million in and versus salt sales in were million  a decline from pro forma sales of million 
sales were comparatively lower in in part due to the absence of fourth quarter european salt sales following the divestiture of that business 
earnings from continuing operations for were million  a decline from pro forma of million and a million increase from million in despite strong weather related results in the fourth quarter of  the change in sales and earnings was largely attributable to the impact of a mild winter at the beginning of on sales of ice control salt in contrast with a more severe winter in early excluding non recurring items  earnings were million in  a million increase from million in corporate versus corporate loss from continuing operations in totaled million compared to million in the current period benefited from interest cost savings as a result of lower debt levels and interest rates compared to the prior year 
offsetting the interest savings are additional provisions for environmental remediation net of insurance recoveries and increased employee related expenses 
excluding non recurring items  corporate losses decreased to million compared to million in versus corporate loss from continuing operations in totaled million  a decline from million in the years and included charges of million for rodel and million for morton  respectively  for ipr d related to these acquisitions 
excluding non recurring items  corporate losses increased to million compared to million in liquidity  capital resources and other financial data cash and cash equivalents remained unchanged at million at december  net cash in flows during and resulted in net increases in cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
each of these years included acquisition  divestiture and financing activities having a significant effect on the company s cash flows 
see note acquisitions and dispositions of assets in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
free cash flows which the company defines as cash provided by operating activities less capital asset spending and dividends for the year compared to and are presented below millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities capital additions dividends free cash flow the company s short term  primary source of liquidity will be cash flow from operations  supplemented as necessary with commercial paper and or bank borrowings 
at year end  the company maintains an unused credit facility with a syndicated group of banks of million  million of which is committed until the commitment of this facility is not contingent on the company s credit rating 
the company does not believe there is a material risk to short term liquidity 
as of december   the company had no letters of credit or material guarantees outstanding 
financing total borrowings at year end were  million  only of which is due prior to total borrowings were  million at year end at the end of  the debt ratio was compared with at the end of in  the company issued million euros or million of notes due on february   the company issued billion yen or million of notes  interest payable semiannually on march th and september th  beginning in march the maturity date is march   callable annually after march proceeds from the issuance of the note will be used for general corporate purposes 
the company contemplates some early retirement of debt via calls and repurchases as opportunities arise in order to gain the long term benefits of reduced interest expense 
as a result  some non recurring losses will be recorded during contractual obligations the following table provides the company s contractual obligations and commitments for future payments millions of dollars payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years over years total borrowings capital lease obligations   operating leases total contractual cash obligations   trading activities the company does not have any trading activity that involves non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
unconsolidated entities the company has no controlling ownership in significant entities which are not consolidated 
there are no significant contractual requirements to fund losses of unconsolidated entities 
material contingent liabilities  guarantees and commitments not included in the consolidated balance sheet are disclosed in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements under note contingent liabilities  guarantees and commitments 
environmental there is a risk of environmental impact in chemical manufacturing operations 
the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the possibility of significant environmental impact 
the laws and regulations under which the company operates require significant expenditures for capital improvements  the operation of environmental protection equipment and remediation 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company s major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
the company is a party in various government enforcement and private actions associated with former waste disposal sites  many of which are on the us environmental protection agency s epa national priority list and has been named a potentially responsible party at approximately inactive waste sites where remediation costs have been or may be incurred under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and similar state statutes 
in some of these cases the company may also be held responsible for alleged property damage 
the company has provided for future costs at certain of these sites 
the company is also involved in corrective actions at some of its manufacturing facilities 
the company considers a broad range of information when determining the amount of its remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for this or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other principally responsible parties to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
these accruals are assessed quarterly and updated as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
however  at certain sites  the company is unable  due to a variety of factors  to assess and quantify the ultimate extent of its responsibility for study and remediation costs 
major sites for which reserves have been provided are the non company owned lipari  woodland and kramer sites in new jersey  whitmoyer in pennsylvania and company owned sites in bristol and philadelphia  pennsylvania and houston  texas 
the morton acquisition introduced two major sites moss point  mississippi and wood ridge  new jersey 
in wood ridge  new jersey  morton and velsicol chemical corporation velsicol have been held jointly and severally liable for the cost of remediation necessary to correct mercury related environmental problems associated with a mercury processing plant on the site prior to its acquisition by morton 
at the date of acquisition  morton had disclosed and accrued for certain ongoing studies  which are expected to be completed during  with regulatory decisions expected by the end of in its allocation of the purchase price of morton  the company accrued for additional study costs at december  and additional remediation costs in based on the progress of the technical studies 
a separate study of probable contamination in berry s creek  which runs near the plant site  and of the surrounding wetlands is on a timetable yet to be determined 
therefore  the estimated costs of this separate study and any resulting remediation requirements have not been considered in the allocation of the morton purchase price 
there is much uncertainty as to what will be required to address berry s creek but cleanup costs could be very high and the company s share of these costs could be material 
the company s exposure will also depend upon the continued ability of velsicol and its indemnitor  fruit of the loom  inc  which has filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws  to contribute to the cost of remediation 
in  these parties have stopped paying their share of expenses 
ultimately  the company s exposure will also depend on the results of attempts to obtain contributions from others believed to share responsibility 
a cost recovery action against these responsible parties is pending in federal court 
this action has been stayed pending future regulatory developments and the appeal of a summary judgment ruling in favor of one of the defendants 
settlements have been reached with some defendants for claims considered de minimis associated with the wood ridge plant site 
during  the epa notified morton of possible irregularities in water discharge monitoring reports filed by its moss point  mississippi plant in early morton investigated and identified other environmental issues at the plant 
though at the date of acquisition morton had accrued for some remediation and legal costs  the company revised these accruals as part of the allocation of the purchase price of morton based on its discussions with the authorities and on the information available as of june  in  the company reached agreement with the epa  the department of justice and the state of mississippi  resolving these historical environmental issues 
the agreement received court approval in early the final settlement includes payment of million in civil penalties  which were paid in the first quarter of  million in criminal penalties  which were paid in the fourth quarter of and million in various supplemental environmental projects 
the accruals established for this matter were sufficient to cover these and other related costs of the settlement 
in december  the company closed the chemicals portion of the moss point facility 
the amount charged to earnings before tax for environmental remediation was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and the amount charged in was immaterial 
the reserves for remediation were million and million at december  and  respectively  and are recorded as other liabilities current and long term 
the company is pursuing lawsuits over insurance coverage for environmental liabilities 
it is the company s practice to reflect environmental insurance recoveries in results of operations for the quarter in which the litigation is resolved through settlement or other appropriate legal processes 
resolutions typically resolve coverage for both past and future environmental spending 
the company settled with several of its insurance carriers and recorded income before tax of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to accrued environmental liabilities  the company had reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  the company has identified other sites  including its larger manufacturing facilities  where additional future environmental remediation may be required  but these loss contingencies cannot reasonably be estimated at this time 
these matters involve significant unresolved issues  including the number of parties found liable at each site and their ability to pay  the outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  the alternative methods of remediation and the range of costs associated with those alternatives 
the company believes that these matters  when ultimately resolved  which may be over an extended period of time  will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows of the company  but could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given period 
capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million in versus million in and million in spending for and is expected to be million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental aspects of projects in other categories that are intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
the company expects future capital spending for environmental protection equipment to be consistent with prior year spending patterns 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
cash expenditures for waste disposal site remediation were million in  million in and million in the expenditures for remediation are charged against accrued remediation reserves 
the cost of operating and maintaining environmental facilities was million  million and million in  and respectively  and was charged against current year earnings 
other litigation there has been increased publicity about asbestos liabilities faced by manufacturing companies 
as a result of the bankruptcy of most major asbestos producers  plaintiffs attorneys are increasing their focus on peripheral defendants 
the company believes it has adequate reserves and insurance and does not believe its asbestos exposure is material 
there are pending lawsuits filed against morton related to employee exposure to asbestos at a manufacturing facility in weeks island  louisiana with additional lawsuits expected 
the company expects that most of these cases will be dismissed because they are barred under worker s compensation laws  however  cases involving asbestos caused malignancies may not be barred under louisiana law 
subsequent to the morton acquisition  the company commissioned medical studies to estimate possible future claims and recorded accruals based on the results 
morton has also been sued in connection with the former friction division of the former thiokol corporation which merged with morton in settlements to date total thousand and many cases have closed with no payment

new accounting pronouncements o accounting for derivative instruments and other hedging activities on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes a new model for the accounting and reporting of derivative and hedging transactions 
additionally  in july the company adopted dig issue g  assessing and measuring the effectiveness of a purchased option used in a cash flow hedge 
this standard requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
for instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the instrument will largely be offset on the income statement by changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for instruments designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the hedge is reported in other comprehensive income until it is assigned to earnings in the same period in which the hedged item has an impact on earnings 
for instruments designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign operating units not using the us dollar as its functional currency  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be offset in other comprehensive income to the extent that they are effective as economic hedges 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments  including embedded derivatives  that are not designated as a hedge will be recorded each period in current earnings along with any ineffective portion of hedges 
using market valuations for derivatives held as of december   the company recorded a million after tax cumulative income effect to accumulated other comprehensive income  and a charge to net income of million  to recognize at fair value all derivative instruments on january  changes in the company s derivative instrument portfolio or changes in the market values of this portfolio could have a material effect on accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company has concluded that the adoption of sfas no 
will not materially change management s risk policies and practices nor will compliance with the standard materially impact the reported results from operations 
o business combinations sfas no 
 business combinations  which is effective for all business combinations completed after june   mandates that all business combinations be accounted for by only the purchase method thereby eliminating the option for pooling of interests  segregation of other intangible assets from goodwill if they meet the contractual legal criterion or the separability criterion  and expanded disclosure requirements on the primary reasons for a business combination and the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption 
o goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
 which the company adopted on january   requires the company to cease amortization of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets and evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
in accordance with the statement  the company reviewed its intangible assets in order to identify intangible assets with indefinite lives which will no longer be amortized and intangible assets which may be reclassified as goodwill and thus no longer be amortized 
in addition the company is in the process of assessing the remaining useful lives of intangible assets which will continue to be subject to amortization 
as of january   the company ceased amortization of goodwill and intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives and reclassified certain intangibles in accordance with the provisions of this statement 
the evaluation of the company s goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and is a two step process 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  the statement requires the company to first compare a reporting unit s book value to its fair value 
to the extent that the book value exceeds fair value  the company is required to perform a second step wherein a reporting unit s assets and liabilities are fair valued 
to the extent that a reporting unit s book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill  impairment exists and must be recognized 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the fair value of a reporting unit in excess of the fair value of all non goodwill assets in the reporting unit 
net book values of the recorded assets and liabilities have been calculated for each of the company s reporting units 
the company is in the process of valuing these reporting units based primarily upon the present value of expected future cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the intangible assets which continue to be subject to amortization are being reviewed for impairment by the company under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
intangible assets which are no longer subject to amortization are being reviewed by the company in accordance with sfas no 
in a one step process 
impairment is measured as the amount an intangible asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
the company intends to complete its evaluation of intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
no later than june  the company s previous business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as of december   the net carrying amount of goodwill was  million 
goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  was million 
the company intends to complete its evaluation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
no later than june  and expects to recognize an impairment loss 
the company continues to finalize its estimate of the impairment loss 
any impairment loss will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
o asset retirement obligations in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recognition of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets when a legal obligation to incur such costs arises as a result of the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense over the asset s useful life 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements 
o impairment or disposal of long lived assets on january  the company adopted sfas no 
the statement provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
management has assessed the impact of the new standard and determined there to be no material impact to the financial statements 
cautionary statements any statements made by the company in its filings with the securities and exchange commission or other communications including press releases and analyst meetings and calls that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements include  without limitation  those relating to anticipated product plans  litigation and environmental matters  currency effects  profitability  and other commitments or goals 
forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following o currencies and economic conditions approximately half of the company s revenues are from outside the united states  a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies 
also  significant production facilities are located outside the united states 
the company s financial results therefore can be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
though the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects  it does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
accordingly  reported revenue  net income  cash flows and fair values have been and in the future may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  because of the extensive nature of the company s foreign business activities  financial results could be adversely affected by changes in worldwide economic conditions  changes in trade policies or tariffs  changes in interest rates  and political unrest 
o competition and demand the company s products are sold in a competitive  global economy 
competitors include many large multinational chemical firms based in europe  asia and the united states 
in addition  financial results are subject to fluctuations in demand and the seasonal activity of certain of the company s businesses 
the company also manufactures and sells its products to customers in industries and countries that are experiencing periods of rapid change  most notably countries in eastern europe and in the asia pacific region 
also  weather conditions have historically had  and will likely continue to have in the future  a significant impact on revenues and earnings in the company s salt segment 
these factors can adversely affect demand for the company s products and therefore may have a significant impact on financial results 
o supply and capacity from time to time certain raw materials the company requires become limited 
it is likely this will occur again in the future 
should such limitations arise  disruptions of the company s supply chain may lead to higher prices and or shortages 
also  from time to time  the company is subject to increases in raw material prices and  from time to time  experiences significant capacity limitations in its own manufacturing operations 
these limitations  disruptions in supply  price increases and capacity constraints could adversely affect financial results 
o technology the company has invested significant resources in intellectual properties such as patents  trademarks  copyrights  and trade secrets 
the company relies on the protection these intellectual property rights provide since it depends on these intellectual resources for its financial stability and its future growth 
the development and successful implementation of new  competing technologies in the market place could significantly impact future financial results 
o joint ventures  acquisitions and alliances the company has entered  and in the future may enter  into arrangements with other companies to expand product offerings and to enhance its own capabilities 
it will likely also continue to make strategic acquisitions and divestitures 
the success of acquisitions of new technologies  companies and products  or arrangements with third parties  is not predictable and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in realizing its objectives  or that realization may not take longer than anticipated  or that there will not be unintended adverse consequences from these actions 
o environmental risks and uncertainties related to environmental matters are discussed on pages through of this form k 
item a 
market risk discussion the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since it denominates its business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  finances its operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchases raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
the company s operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
the company has established policies governing its use of derivative instruments 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments of which the values are not available from independent third parties 
the company manages counter party risk by entering derivative contracts with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating and by limiting amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause where each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of december   the fair market value of all such contracts was million  all of which were held by investment grade financial institutions 
the company enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
the company does not hedge its exposure to market risk in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on the company s business operations  the risk management system uses sensitivity analysis 
the analysis assumes simultaneous shifts in those rates and quantifies the impact of such shifts on the company s earnings  cash flows  and fair values of assets and liabilities during a one year period 
the range of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflects the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and prices chosen 
foreign exchange rate risk short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
the company covers known and anticipated external transactions and operating exposures by using foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries primarily germany  france  italy  netherlands  the united kingdom  sweden  and switzerland  as well as brazil  mexico  canada  japan  taiwan  china and australia 
the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation and depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would reduce and increase by million  the fair value of foreign currency hedging contracts held at december  the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
long term exposures to foreign currency exchange rate risk are managed primarily through operational activities 
the company manufactures its products in a number of locations around the world  hence  has a cost base in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
additionally  the company finances in local currencies its operations outside the united states 
such diverse base of local currency costs and financings serves to partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund its business operations 
the company s current strategic policy is to maintain from to of floating rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce by million  the fair value of liabilities under its floating and fixed rate instruments  including short and long term debt and derivative contracts outstanding as of december  a basis point decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value by million 
however  such changes in fair values would not have a material impact on earnings per share or cash flows as the majority of the company s debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate instruments 
a basis point movement is equivalent to approximately of the company s weighted average rate on its worldwide debt 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain raw materials such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  butanol and styrene under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material prices have historically had material impacts on the company s earnings and cash flows  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
the company uses commodity derivative instruments to modify some of the commodity price risks 
assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  the potential change in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts held at december  approximates million  which would not be material when compared with the company s earnings and financial position 
forward looking statements this market risk discussion and the estimated amounts presented are forward looking statements that assume certain market conditions known at december  actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in business climate  economic and competitive uncertainties  future acquisitions activities and any unforeseen developments in relevant financial markets  including asia and latin america 
the methods used above to assess risk should not be considered projections of expected future events or results
