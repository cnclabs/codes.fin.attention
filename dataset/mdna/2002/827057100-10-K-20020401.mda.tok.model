all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under the heading business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading supplier of flash memory semiconductor devices for the digital consumer  networking  wireless communication and internet computing markets 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
downturns of this type occurred in  and  and more recently in late and these downturns have been characterized by weakening product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
we began to experience a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
during the first half of  market conditions did not improve as our customers continued to cancel backlog and or push out shipments 
in the second half of  we began to see a positive change in order activities for our products for dvd players  cd rw drives  pdas and video games  as well as the continued strong shipment from the second quarter in our products for pcs and graphics cards 
sales of our products for the networking and wireless communications market segments continued to be very weak 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
our product sales are made primarily using short term cancelable purchase orders 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as shipment schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs and in our supply of product 
accordingly  our backlog of open purchase orders at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
changes in the amount of our backlog do not necessarily reflect a corresponding change in the level of actual or potential sales 
we derived  and of our product revenues during  and  respectively  from product shipments to asia 
additionally  substantially all of our wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
our top ten end customers  which excludes transactions through stocking representatives and distributors  accounted for  and of our net product revenues in  and  respectively 
no single end customer  which we define as original equipment manufacturers  or oems  original design manufacturers  or odms  contract electronic manufacturers  or cems  or end users  represented or more of our net product revenues during  and since march  we have been out sourcing our customer service logistics in taiwan to silicon professional technology ltd  or spt 
spt is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our stocking representatives in taiwan  professional computer technology limited  or pct 
spt provides planning  warehousing  delivery  billing  collection and other logistic functions for us in taiwan 
spt now services substantially all of our end customers based in taiwan and selected end customers throughout asia 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as consigned inventory  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
for the year ended december   spt serviced end customer sales accounting for of our net product revenues recognized 
we are in the process of working with spt to expand their service coverage to include all of our end customers in china and southeast asia 
we ship products to  and have accounts receivable from  oems  odms  cems  stocking representatives  domestic distributors  and our logistics center 
our stocking representatives  domestic distributors and logistics center reship our products to our end customers  including oems  odms  cems and end users 
in  actron technology co  ltd  or actron  a stocking representative  represented of our net product revenues 
no stocking representative or domestic distributor serviced more than of our end customer sales in or as of december   no end customer  domestic distributor  logistics center or stocking representative exceeded of our accounts receivable 
as of december   spt  our logistics center  represented of our accounts receivable and actron  a stocking representative  represented of our accounts receivable 
results of operations years ended december    and net revenues net revenues were million in compared to million in and million in net revenues decreased from to due to decreased shipment volume of our products and due to decreased average selling prices 
the increase from to was due to increased shipment volume of new and existing products and due to our ability to raise prices slightly in the second half of average selling prices fluctuate due to a number of factors including the overall supply and demand for our products in the marketplace  maturing product cycles and changes in general economic conditions 
we began to experience a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
despite continued difficult market conditions  in the second half of we began to see a positive change in order activities in our products for dvd players  cd rw drives  pdas and video games  as well as the continued strong shipment in our products for desktop pcs and graphics cards 
sales of our products for the networking and wireless communications market segments continued to be very weak 
product revenues 
product revenues were million in  million in and million in the decrease from to was primarily due to decreased shipment volume of our products by approximately and due to decreased average selling prices for our products of approximately 
the increase from to was primarily due to shipments of new products introduced in shipping volumes fluctuate due to overall industry supply and demand 
license revenues 
revenues from license fees and royalties were million in  million in and million in the increase from both to and from to was primarily due to license fees received as part of a legal settlement from winbond totaling million in and million in no further payments are required to be paid under this legal settlement 
we anticipate that license revenues may fluctuate significantly in the future 
gross profit gross profit was million  or gross margin of of net revenues  in  million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in gross profit decreased from to primarily due to inventory valuation adjustments  decreases in unit shipments by approximately and decreases in average selling prices by approximately and increases in anticipated warranty costs 
for the year ended december   inventory valuation adjustments to cost of sales amounted to million 
due to the industry wide excess inventory built up in late and competition our average selling prices declined throughout  this was more pronounced in the second half of accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down our inventory primarily to reflect the lower average selling prices at which we expect to sell our inventory 
this resulted in a fourth quarter net increase in our allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market of approximately million 
gross profit increased from to due to increased shipments by approximately of existing cost reduced products  increased shipments of new  higher margin products  and increased average selling prices by approximately on both older and newer products 
we also wrote down million and million of inventory related to lower of cost or market and products that we determined to be excess or obsolete during and  respectively 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared to million or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in dollars from to was due to hiring additional personnel  development of new products  improvements in our infrastructure  an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts  and an increase in our legal accruals in connection with the atmel litigation  offset by the lack of profit sharing expenses 
the increase in dollars from to was primarily due to increased profit sharing with employees  increased commissions  and increased salaries and benefits due to hiring additional personnel 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  sales and marketing and to general and administrative activities  and that these expenses will continue to increase in dollars 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  quality assurance activities and occupancy costs 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  and the cost of materials such as wafers and masks 
research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues in the increase in research and development expenses in dollars from to was primarily due to increases in headcount and related costs of approximately million  non production engineering material expenses of approximately million  depreciation related to purchases of new engineering equipment of million  design costs of approximately million and increased expenses related to engineering and mask costs of approximately  offset by a decrease in profit sharing expenses of approximately million 
research and development expenses increased in dollars from to primarily due to increases in profit sharing expenses of approximately million  headcount and related costs of approximately million and material costs of approximately million 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions  headcount and related costs  as well as travel and entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenues  in as compared to million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in dollars from to was primarily due to decreases in commissions of approximately million and profit sharing expenses of approximately million  offset by increases in headcount related costs of approximately million and patent costs of approximately  sales and marketing expenses in increased in dollars from primarily due to increases in commissions of approximately million owed on higher product revenues  headcount and related costs of million due to increased headcount and the lease of additional space and profit sharing expenses of approximately million 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  fluctuations in revenues will cause fluctuations in sales and marketing expenses as it impacts our commissions expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for administrative  executive and finance personnel  recruiting costs  professional services and legal fees and allowances for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net revenues  in as compared to million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in general and administrative expenses increased in dollars from to primarily due to increases in expenses related to our allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million  headcount and related costs of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization of approximately  offset by a decrease in profit sharing expenses of approximately million 
expenses increased in dollars from to primarily due to increases in expenses related to our legal matters of approximately million  profit sharing expenses of approximately million  headcount and related costs of approximately  and depreciation expenses of approximately  associated with our new oracle erp system  which we implemented in january we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in dollars as we scale our facilities  infrastructure  and headcount to support our overall expected growth 
we may also incur additional expenses in connection with the atmel litigation 
for further information on this litigation see legal proceedings 
other operating expenses 
in  other operating expenses of million  or of net revenues  was comprised of million related to one time charges for asset impairment and a  period charge related to an operating lease for an abandoned building 
this charge represents the estimated difference between the total non discounted future sublease income and our non discounted lease commitments relating to this building 
the charge is an estimate and may be adjusted if we obtain a sublease for the building and the actual sublease income is significantly different from the estimate 
we may be unable to secure subtenants for such space due to the recent decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take an additional period charge for the balance of the future lease cost 
during  kye  a company in which we have an equity investment  completed an initial public offering on the taiwan stock exchange 
since the initial public offering there has been a significant decline in the per share price of kye s common stock 
we have concluded that the decline in value is other than temporary and accordingly reduced the value of our equity investment from million to million  based on the quoted market price as of december  for a million charge 
a charge of million  or of net revenues  in  relates to the expense for in process research and development incurred during the acquisition of agate semiconductor inc refer also to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of agate s patents  workforce  and the technology currently under development was determined by an independent appraiser using the income approach for the patents and technology and the cost approach for the workforce 
the income approach discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward by a premium of to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
we believe that the pricing model related to this acquisition is consistent within the high technology industry 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of the expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
in process research and development valued at million consisted of a single project to develop a high density multiple bit per cell flash memory device targeted for high density  mass data storage applications such as digital cameras  mp players  cellular telephones and pagers 
at the time of the acquisition the estimated cost to complete the project was to million and the design of this device was approximately complete 
the risk adjusted discount rate relating to in process technology determined by the independent appraiser to be 
as of december   the design of this device was approximately complete  and the estimated cost to complete the project was approximately million 
we expected the multiple bit per cell device to be completed and to begin to generate cash flows within to months from the date of the acquisition 
however  development of the multiple bit per cell and its viability remains a significant risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the multiple bit per cell device into a commercially viable product consists principally of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the multiple bit per cell device can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring the multiple bit per cell device to market in a timely manner could result in a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenues and net income from the multiple bit per cell device will negatively impact the return on the investment expected at the time of the acquisition and potentially result in impairment of other assets related to the development activities 
during the quarter ended december   due to the delays in completing the first multiple bit per cell device  we recorded an expense for impairment of intangible assets of  the assets relate to patents acquired as part of the acquisition of agate semiconductor inc in december we reviewed the recoverability of the recorded amounts based on expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from use of these assets and then determined the impairment loss of  based on the difference between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of the assets 
a charge of million  or of net revenues  in  relates to the expense for in process research and development incurred during the acquisition of linvex technology corporation 
refer also to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of linvex core technology  existing products  as well as the technology currently under development was determined by an independent appraiser using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward by a premium of to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
we expect that the pricing model related to this acquisition will be considered standard within the high technology industry 
we do not expect to achieve material expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
in process research and development valued at million consisted of a single project to combine flash and sram memory on a single device the combomemory device 
at the time of the acquisition the estimated cost to complete the combomemory device was million and the device was approximately complete 
the risk adjusted discount rate relating to in process technology was 
during early  the combomemory device was completed and began to generate cash flows 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was approximately million  or of net revenues  during  as compared to million  or of net revenues  during  and  or of net revenues  during interest income decreased in dollars from to due to a decrease in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments and due to declined interest rates 
interest income increased from to due to the receipt of cash proceeds from a follow on public offering and private placement  which closed on march   and the underwriters exercise of an over allotment option  which closed on april  interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  during as compared to  during and  during interest expense in relates to interest and fees under our line of credit  and in and relates to borrowing prior to the completion of a follow on public offering and to fee activity under our line of credit 
interest expense charges are expected to continue and will fluctuate depending on our use of the line of credit facility 
provision for benefit from income taxes our income tax benefit of million in consists of a tax rate on loss before income taxes 
this compares with provision for income taxes of approximately million  or  in and  or  in the effective tax rate was lower than due to the reversal of the valuation allowance that was recorded in and we expect our effective tax rate to decrease to approximately for our tax rate may change depending on our profitability and the timing of the implementation of certain tax planning strategies 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
segment reporting our operations involve the design  development  manufacturing  marketing and technical support of our nonvolatile memory products 
we offer low and medium density devices that target a broad range of existing and emerging applications in the digital consumer  networking  wireless communications and internet computing markets 
our products are differentiated based upon attributes such as density  voltage  access speed  package and predicted endurance 
we also license our technology for use in non competing applications 
our reportable segments are the standard memory product group  or smpg  the application specific product group  or aspg  and the special product group  or spg 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for revenue and gross profit information by reportable segment 
note that during and we had different reportable segments  and therefore the prior period information has been restated to conform to the new presentation 
our analysis of the changes for each segment is discussed below 
smpg includes our three standard flash memory product families the small sector flash  or ssf  family  the multi purpose flash  or mpf  family  and the many time programmable  or mtp  family and certain custom products based on these standard flash memory families 
these families allow us to produce products optimized for cost and functionality to support the broad range of applications that use nonvolatile memory products 
smpg revenues decreased from million in to million in due primarily to decreased unit shipments and lower average selling prices 
gross margin decreased from in to negative in for this segment primarily due to the inventory valuation adjustments to cost of sales during  decreased unit shipments and decreased average selling prices 
smpg revenues increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased unit shipments and higher average selling prices 
gross margin increased from in to in due to changes in unit shipment mix of existing cost reduced products  increased shipments of new  higher margin products  and increased average selling prices on both older and newer products 
aspg includes flashbank  concurrent superflash  serial flash  firmware hub  or fwh  and lpc flash products 
these products are designed to address specific applications such as cellular phones  pagers  pdas  set top boxes  hard disk drives and pc bios applications 
aspg also includes flash embedded controllers and our mass data storage products such as the flashflex  adc  adm  and compactflash card product families  address digital cameras  internet appliances  pdas  mp players  set top boxes and other types of mass data storage applications 
aspg revenues increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased unit shipments of our fwh products  which were introduced in early gross margin decreased from in  to in due to decreased average selling prices and inventory valuation adjustments to cost of sales in aspg revenues increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased unit shipments of our fwh products 
gross margin increased from in to in primarily due to strong shipments of our fwh products  which were introduced in the second half of spg includes combomemory  rom ram combos  sram related and other special flash products 
spg revenues decreased from million in to million in due primarily to decreased unit shipments and lower average selling prices 
gross margin decreased from in to negative in for this segment due to changes in the mix of the types of products sold between the reporting periods and inventory valuation adjustments to cost of sales in spg revenues increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased unit shipments of our combomemory products 
gross margin increased from in to in due to changes in unit shipment mix and average selling prices 
revenue and gross profit related to technology licensing was million for  million for and million for the increase from both to and from to was primarily due to license fee received as part of a legal settlement from winbond totaling million in and million in no further payments are required to be paid under this legal settlement 
we anticipate that license revenues will fluctuate significantly in the future

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market  warranty accrual  litigation costs  valuation of equity investments  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
sales to direct customers and foreign stocking representatives are recognized upon shipment of product net of an allowance for estimated returns 
when product is shipped to direct customers or stocking representatives  or by our distributors or spt to end users  prior to recognizing revenue  we also require evidence of the arrangement  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our shipping terms are generally fob shipping point and payment terms typically range from to days 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  we defer recognition of such revenues  related costs of revenues and related gross profit until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
product shipped to spt is accounted for as consigned inventory and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
most of our technology licenses provide for the payment of up front license fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
for license and other arrangements for technology that we are continuing to enhance and refine and under which we are obligated to provide unspecified enhancements  revenue is recognized over the lesser of the estimated period that we have historically enhanced and developed refinements to the technology  approximately one to two years the upgrade period  or the remaining portion of the upgrade period from the date of delivery  provided all specified technology and documentation has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
from time to time  we reexamine the estimated upgrade period relating to licensed technology to determine if a change in the estimated upgrade period is needed 
revenue from license or other technology arrangements where we are not continuing to enhance and refine technology or are not obligated to provide unspecified enhancements is recognized upon delivery  if the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
royalties received under these arrangements during the upgrade period are recognized as revenue based on the ratio of the elapsed portion of the upgrade period to the estimated upgrade period 
the remaining portions of the royalties are recognized ratably over the remaining portion of the upgrade period 
royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed are recognized when reported to us  which generally coincides with the receipt of payment 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates in relation to the estimated period of technology enhancement and development  the amount and timing of our license and royalty revenues could be materially different 
allowance for sales returns 
we maintain allowances for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other assumptions 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future average selling prices  and  if our projected average selling prices are over estimated  we may be required to adjust our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we maintain allowance for inventory for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and those inventories carried at costs that are higher than their market values 
if we determine that market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty accrual 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are also involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
while we have accrued certain amounts for the estimated legal costs associated with defending these matters  there can be no assurance the atmel complaint or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
as of december   no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies 
if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations in the semiconductor industry 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments at december  is million 
accounting for income taxes 
if appropriate  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a charge to income in the period such determination was made

requires that all derivative instruments be recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
we adopted sfas no 
 as amended  in our quarter ending march  we do not hold and have not held any derivative instruments  and accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
to date has not had a significant impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a division of a business 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale and requires the measurement to be at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
our operating activities used cash of million in primarily due to net loss of million  increases in trade accounts receivable from related party of million and inventory of million  and decreases in trade accounts payable from related and unrelated parties of million  accrued expenses of million and deferred revenue of million 
cash used in operating activities was reduced by decreases in trade accounts receivable from unrelated parties of million  other current and non current assets of million  and non cash adjustments of million  primarily relating to our provision for sales returns of million  inventory valuation adjustments of million  depreciation and amortization of million  our increased provision for doubtful accounts receivable of million and other operating expenses of million  and offset by million from the change in deferred income taxes 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable from unrelated parties relates to decreased shipment volume and decreased average selling prices 
the increase in accounts receivable related parties relates to spt  our new logistics center in taiwan 
cash provided by operations was million in and relates primarily to net income of million offset by accounts receivable increase of million and an increase in accounts receivable from related parties of million  all due to increased sales in increases in trade accounts payable to unrelated parties of million  trade accounts payable to related parties of million  and accrued expenses of million and deferred revenue of million were offset by increases in inventory of million and increases in other current and non current assets of million 
investing activities 
our investing activities provided cash of approximately million during  primarily due to a total of million cash from the excess sales and maturities of available for sale investments over the purchases of such investments  offset by million used to acquire equity investments  of which million was invested in gsmc 
gsmc is a cayman islands company with wafer foundry operations under construction in china 
further  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures and used approximately  of cash for the final payment of our agate acquisition 
cash used in investing activities of million during consisted primarily of investments of cash in available for sale marketable securities 
we also made strategic equity investments in privately held companies which are either subcontractors to our production process or customers 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we acquired equipment  invested in enterprise resource planning software  and made leasehold improvements 
we plan to continue to invest in capital equipment to be used primarily for test equipment and design engineering tools for research and development  information systems infrastructure  and leasehold improvements 
financing activities 
our financing activities provided cash of approximately million in and million during during  cash provided was from million of common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options and million related to a loan from a landlord  offset by  in loan repayments and other financing activities 
in  cash was primarily provided from the issuance of common stock for million and primarily relates to net proceeds from a follow on public offering in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock  a private placement in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock  and million from common stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options  offset by the repayment of our entire line of credit at the end of march principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term available for sale investments and the line of credit 
as of december  we had no borrowing on our line of credit of up to million 
under the agreement  our borrowing is limited to of eligible world wide accounts receivable  and is also reduced by any letters of credit issued under our line of credit 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding in letters of credit and million available under this line 
the line bears interest at a rate of the bank s reference rate plus at december   with a minimum interest rate of 
under the agreement  we are required to comply with certain covenants including maintaining a specified level of tangible net worth and we are not permitted to pay a dividend 
while we maintained the specified level of tangible net worth  we were in default of certain other covenants and reporting obligations 
on february   the lender granted a waiver of these defaults and has also waived future compliance with certain covenants and reporting obligations  subject to certain conditions  through the maturity of the line of credit in september we must pay an unused line fee at the annual rate of one quarter of one percent on the unused portion 
purchase commitments 
in december  we committed  subject to certain business conditions  to prepay million to a vendor in to secure increased wafer capacity in and in the second quarter of  in response to weakening product demand and economic conditions  we renegotiated the commitment to defer the payment to as of december   we had prepaid a total of million towards this commitment  which is included in other current assets on the balance sheet 
in addition  we had outstanding purchase commitments with our foundry vendors of approximately million for delivery in lease commitments 
we have long term  non cancelable building lease commitments 
we are currently seeking subtenants for our unused office space 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a period charge to other operating expense of approximately  relating to an operating lease for an abandoned building 
this charge represents the estimated difference between the total non discounted future sublease income and our non discounted lease commitments relating to this building 
the charge is an estimate as of december  and may be adjusted if we obtain a sublease for the building and the actual sublease income is significantly different from the estimate 
we may be unable to secure subtenants for such space due to the recent decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
see also business risks if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take a period charge for the difference between the total future sublease income and our lease cost 
future payments due under building lease and purchase commitments as of december in thousands building purchase lease commitments to tal thereafter  stock purchase plan 
in september  our board of directors authorized the purchase of an aggregate of up to million of our common stock 
the purchases may be made in the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market  subject to compliance with applicable provisions of the california corporation code and in accordance with applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations 
the stock purchase program will continue until september  unless earlier revoked by our board of directors 
as of december   no shares had been purchased under this program 
we believe that our cash balances  together with funds expected to be generated from operations and the line of credit availability  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional borrowings or capital and  if so required  that such borrowing or capital will be available on acceptable terms 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include the average selling prices of our products  customer demand for our products  the need to secure future wafer production capacity from our suppliers  the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue  and unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
please also see business risks our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenues may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
business risks risks related to our business our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenues may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
although we were profitable in  we incurred net losses for  and in fiscal  and our operating results have fluctuated significantly and our past financial performance should not be used to predict future operating results 
our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are out of our control the availability  timely delivery and cost of wafers or other manufacturing and assembly services from our suppliers  competitive pricing pressures and related changes in selling prices  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  new product announcements and introductions of competing products by us or our competitors  product obsolescence  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of products utilizing our superflash technology  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  exchange rate fluctuations  general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  difficulties in forecasting  planning and management of inventory levels  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue 
as recent experience confirms  a downturn in the market for products such as personal computers and cellular telephones that incorporate our products can also harm our operating results 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our projections 
we may experience revenue shortfalls for the following reasons sudden drops in consumer demand which may cause customers to cancel backlog  push out shipment schedules  or reduce new orders  possibly due to a slowing economy or inventory corrections among our customers  significant declines in selling prices that occur because of competitive price pressure during an over supply market environment  sudden shortages of raw materials for fabrication  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations  and the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 
during we incurred inventory valuation adjustments of million and we may incur additional significant inventory valuation adjustments in the future 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future average selling prices  and  if our projected average selling prices are over estimated  we may be required to adjust our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
as of december   we had million of inventory on hand  an increase of million  or  from total valuation adjustments to inventory were million in  million in and million in due to the large number of units in our inventory  even a small change in average selling prices could result in a significant adjustment and could harm our financial results 
cancellations or rescheduling of backlog may result in lower future revenue and harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
we began to experience a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
although we had improvements in total units shipped in the third and fourth quarter of  revenues declined in due to declines in total shipment volume for and decreased average selling prices 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
during  and  our export product and licensing revenues accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues  respectively 
our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  each of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would harm our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in complying with regulatory requirements and standards  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  extended accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  limits on repatriation of earnings  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in addition  we have made equity investments in companies with operations in china  japan and taiwan 
the value of our investments is subject to the economic and political conditions particular to their industry  their countries and to the global economy 
if we determine that a change in the recorded value of an investment is other than temporary  we will adjust the value of the investment 
such an expense could have a negative impact on our operating results 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down our investment in kye by million to million due to an other than temporary decline in its market value 
we derived  and of our net product revenues from asia during  and  respectively 
additionally  substantially all of our wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
any kind of economic  political or environmental instability in this region of the world can have a severe negative impact on our operating results due to the large concentration of our production and sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian countries where we do business  such as japan  taiwan and korea  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted our revenues and also negatively impacted our ability to collect payments from customers 
during this period  the lack of capital in the financial sectors of these countries made it difficult for our customers to open letters of credit or other financial instruments that are guaranteed by foreign banks 
finally  the economic situation during this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
it should also be noted that we are greatly impacted by the political  economic and military conditions in taiwan 
taiwan and china are continuously engaged in political disputes and both countries have continued to conduct military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue and even escalate  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping or even military hostilities 
additionally  we believe the economic uncertainty fueled by the september  terrorist attacks in the united states has caused our customer base to become more cautious 
any of these events could delay production or shipment of our products 
any kind of activity of this nature or even rumors of such activity could harm our operations  revenues  operating results  and stock price 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and the loss of a major customer could harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers 
in addition  we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
in the past  when we have entered into a long term contract  the contract has generally been terminable at the convenience of the customer 
we depend on stocking representatives  distributors and our logistics center to generate a majority of our revenues 
we rely on stocking representatives and distributors to establish and maintain customer relationships and to sell our products 
these stocking representatives and distributors could discontinue their relationship with us or discontinue selling our products at any time 
the majority of our stocking representatives and distributors are located in asia 
since march  we have been out sourcing our customer service logistics in taiwan to silicon professional technology ltd  or spt 
spt is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our stocking representatives in taiwan  professional computer technology limited  or pct 
spt provides planning  warehousing  delivery  billing  collection and other logistic functions for us in taiwan 
spt now services substantially all of our end customers based in taiwan and selected end customers throughout asia 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as consigned inventory  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
for the year ended december   spt serviced end customer sales accounting for of our net product revenues recognized 
product shipments to asia accounted for  and of net product revenues for  and  respectively 
for further description of our relationships with pct and spt  please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation related party transactions 
we ship to  and have accounts receivable from  oems  odms  cems  stocking representatives  domestic distributors  and our logistics center 
our logistics center  stocking representatives and domestic distributors reship our products to our end customers  including oems  odms  cems and end users 
in  actron  a stocking representative  represented of our net product revenues 
no stocking representative or domestic distributor serviced more than of our customer sales in or no single customer  which we define as an oem  odm  cem  or end user that purchases product directly from us or through our logistics center  represented or more of our net product revenues during  and we do not have any long term contracts with spt or pct  and spt or pct may cease providing services to us at any time 
if spt or pct were to terminate their relationship with us we would experience a delay in reestablishing warehousing  logistics and distribution functions  which would harm our business 
the loss of our relationship with any of these stocking representatives  logistics center or distributors  or any other significant stocking representative or distributor could harm our operating results by impairing our ability to sell our products to our end customers 
we depend on a limited number of foreign foundries to manufacture our products  and these foundries may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we outsource substantially all of our manufacturing and testing activities 
we currently buy all of our wafers and sorted die from a limited number of suppliers 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by four foundries  tsmc in taiwan  sanyo and seiko epson in japan  and samsung in korea 
we anticipate that these foundries  together with national semiconductor in the united states  nanya and vanguard in taiwan and oki in japan  will manufacture the majority of our products in on march   we invested million in gsmc  a cayman islands company  for a wafer foundry project located in shanghai  china 
we anticipate that gsmc will begin to manufacture some of our products in early if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of revenues or higher than anticipated costs of revenues  any of which could harm our operating results 
our revenues may be impacted by our ability to obtain adequate wafer supplies from our foundries 
the foundries with which we currently have arrangements  together with any additional foundry at which capacity might be obtained  may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices 
in addition  we have encountered delays in qualifying new products and in ramping up new product production and we could experience these delays in the future 
we are also subject to the risks of service disruptions  raw material shortages and price increases by our foundries 
such disruptions  shortages and price increases could harm our operating results 
if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity  our revenues may decline 
in order to grow  we need to increase our present manufacturing capacity 
events that we have not foreseen could arise which would limit our capacity 
we have a remaining commitment to prepay a total of million in  subject to certain economic and business conditions  to secure increased wafer capacity in and we are continually engaged in attempting to secure additional manufacturing capacity to support our long term growth 
similar to our million investment in gsmc  we may determine that it is necessary to invest substantial capital in order to secure appropriate production capacity commitments 
if we cannot secure additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired and our operating results will be harmed 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take a period charge for the difference between the total future sublease income and our lease cost 
we have long term  non cancelable building lease commitments 
we are currently in the process of locating subtenants for our unused office space 
we may be unable to secure subtenants for this space due to the recent decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a period charge to other operating expense of approximately  relating to an operating lease for an abandoned building 
this charge represents the estimated difference between the total non discounted future sublease income and our non discounted lease commitments relating to this building 
the charge is an estimate as of december  and may be adjusted if we obtain a sublease for the building and the actual sublease income is significantly different from the estimate 
if we are unable to secure subtenants  we may be required to take additional period charges for the balance of the future lease cost  and this will harm our operating results 
our cost of revenues may increase if we are required to purchase manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing if we need substantial capital in order to secure this capacity and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers from time to time have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from marginal design or manufacturing process drift 
yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process  which often makes them difficult  time consuming and costly to correct 
furthermore we rely on independent foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability  which could harm our operating results 
if our foundries discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays and lower revenues 
our wafer and product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production on an older or lower volume manufacturing process that it uses to produce our parts 
additionally  we cannot be certain our foundries will continue to devote resources to advance the process technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
each of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher costs of materials 
we depend on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
these risks may lead to increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
because our flash memory products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
due to the flash memory product cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could harm sales of our products 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor memory components and have recently added significant capacity for such production 
our memory products  which presently account for substantially all of our revenues  compete principally against products offered by amd  atmel  intel  macronix  sanyo  stmicroelectronics and winbond 
if we are successful in developing our high density products  these products will compete principally with products offered by amd  atmel  fujitsu  hitachi  intel  mitsubishi  samsung  sandisk  sharp electronics  stmicroelectronics and toshiba  as well as any new entrants to the market 
in addition  we may in the future experience direct competition from our foundry partners 
we have licensed to our foundry partners the right to fabricate products based on our technology and circuit design  and to sell such products worldwide  subject to our receipt of royalty payments 
competition may also come from alternative technologies such as ferroelectric random access memory  or fram  or other developing technologies 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products and ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we believe that products for these applications will encounter intense competition and be highly price sensitive 
while we are currently developing and introducing new products for these applications  we cannot assure you that these products will reach the market on time  will satisfactorily address customer needs  will be sold in high volume  or will be sold at profitable margins 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional personnel 
we are highly dependent on bing yeh  our president and chief executive officer  as well as the other principal members of our management team and engineering staff 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular the highly skilled design  applications and test engineers involved in the development of flash memory technology 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our corporate headquarters is located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secrets  copyrights  mask work rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
we own patents in the united states relating to our products and processes  and have filed for several more 
in addition  we hold several patents in europe and canada  and have filed several foreign patent applications in europe  japan  korea  taiwan and canada 
we cannot assure you that any pending patent application will be granted 
our operating results could be harmed by the failure to protect our intellectual property 
if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties may assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages that could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
over the past four years we were sued both by atmel corporation and intel corporation regarding patent infringement issues and sued winbond electronics corporation regarding our contractual relationship with them 
significant management time and financial resources have been devoted to defending these lawsuits 
we settled with intel in may  with winbond in october  and the atmel litigation is ongoing 
in addition to the atmel  intel and winbond actions  we receive from time to time  letters or communications from other companies stating that such companies have patent rights that involve our products 
since the design of all of our products is based on superflash technology  any legal finding that the use of our superflash technology infringes the patent of another company would have a significantly negative effect on our entire product line and operating results 
furthermore  if such a finding were made  there can be no assurance that we could license the other company s technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we could successfully operate without such technology 
moreover  if we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages to the owner of the protected technology and could be prohibited from making  using  selling  or importing into the united states any products that infringe the protected technology 
in addition  the management attention consumed by and legal cost associated with any litigation could harm our operating results 
public announcements may hurt our stock price 
during the course of lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
our litigation may be expensive  may be protracted and confidential information may be compromised 
whether or not we are successful in our lawsuit with atmel  we expect this litigation to continue to consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
while we have accrued certain amounts for the estimated legal costs associated with defending this matter  at any time atmel may file additional claims against us  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigation 
further  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
if an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility or those of our suppliers  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenues 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster such as typhoon near one or more of our major suppliers  like the earthquake in september or the typhoon in september that occurred in taiwan could potentially disrupt the operations of those suppliers  which could then limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
prolonged electrical power outages  energy shortages  or increased costs of energy could harm our business 
our design and process research and development facilities and our corporate offices are located in california  which is currently susceptible to power outages and shortages as well as increased energy costs 
to limit this exposure  we are in the process of securing back up generators and power supplies to our main california facilities 
while the majority of our production facilities are not located in california  more extensive power shortages in the state could delay our design and process research and development as well as increase our operating costs 
our growth continues to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market  sell our products or develop new products may he harmed 
our business is experiencing rapid growth which has strained our internal systems and will require us to continuously develop sophisticated information management systems in order to manage the business effectively 
we are currently implementing a supply chain management system and a vendor electronic data interface system 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement these new systems in a timely fashion  that in themselves they will be adequate to address our expected growth  or that we will be able to foresee in a timely manner other infrastructure needs before they arise 
our success depends on the ability of our executive officers to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations will be harmed 
if we fail to successfully implement new management information systems  our business may suffer severe inefficiencies that may harm the results of our operations 
risks related to our industry our success is dependent on the growth and strength of the flash memory market 
all of our products  as well as all new products currently under design  are stand alone flash memory devices or devices embedded with flash memory 
a memory technology other than superflash may be adopted as an industry standard 
our competitors are generally in a better financial and marketing position than we are from which to influence industry acceptance of a particular memory technology 
in particular  a primary source of competition may come from alternative technologies such as fram devices if such technology is commercialized for higher density applications 
to the extent our competitors are able to promote a technology other than superflash as an industry standard  our business will be seriously harmed 
the selling prices for our products are extremely volatile and have historically declined during periods of over capacity or industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
downturns of this type occurred in and  and more recently in late and these downturns are characterized by diminished product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
the flash memory products portion of the semiconductor industry  from which we derive substantially all of our revenues suffered from excess capacity in  and  which resulted in greater than normal declines in our markets  which unfavorably impacted our revenues  gross margins and profitability 
while these conditions improved in and  deteriorating market conditions at the end of and continuing through have resulted in the decline of our selling prices and harmed our operating results 
there is seasonality in our business and if we fail to continue to introduce new products this seasonality may become more pronounced 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics applications market are subject to seasonality 
as a result  sales of these products are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of each year 
in and the first half of  this seasonality was partially offset by the introduction of new products as we continued to diversify our product offerings 
in  this seasonality again became pronounced as it was combined with deteriorating market conditions  which together resulted in sequential quarter to quarter declines in product revenues from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of  and lower sales in the second half of if we fail to continue to introduce new products  our business may suffer and the seasonality of a portion of our sales may become more pronounced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce revenues and or result in operating losses 
in addition  a downturn in the economies of china  japan or taiwan could impair the value of our equity investments in companies with operations in these countries 
if we consider the value of these companies to be impaired  we will write off  or expense  some or all of our investments 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down our investment in kye by million to million due to an other than temporary decline in its market value 
in addition  we have equity investments in companies with operations in china  japan and taiwan with recorded values at december  of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could effect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  any interest expense owed on the line of credit facility  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
as of december   the carrying value of our marketable securities approximated fair value 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments as of december  all of which mature in in thousands
