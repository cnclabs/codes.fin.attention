item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview recent developments and outlook we develop and manufacture optical and radio frequency rf components for next generation communication networks and other photonics applications 
we report revenues in two segments telecom and photonics tools 
through march   substantially all of our revenues were generated from sales of our photonics tools products 
our photonics tools products include instruments and tools used for measuring  moving  modulating and detecting optical signals in commercial and research applications across a wide variety of industries 
beginning in  we began to derive an increasing amount of our revenues from sales of telecom products 
our telecom products include wavelength management products  high speed opto electronics and tunable laser modules  and are classified as actives or passives 
an active component is a device that generates  encodes  amplifies or detects optical signals in optical and electronic domains 
a passive component is a device that functions only in the optical domain  and is generally used to mix  filter  adjust and stabilize optical signals in advanced fiber optic networks 
for the nine month period ended december  and the fiscal years ended december  and december   sales of our telecom products accounted for  and of overall net revenues  respectively 
demand for our telecom products fell abruptly beginning in the latter half of the first quarter of due to the widespread business downturn in the telecommunications industry 
market conditions continued to worsen with each successive quarter of as a result of the telecommunications industry downturn  we experienced order cancellations and rescheduling of orders to later periods 
revenues from our telecom products declined in each quarter of  from million in the first quarter  to million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
at the same time  as a result of the broader economic downturn  demand for our photonics tools also declined  particularly impacting oem sales to the semiconductor market 
revenues from our photonics tools products declined in each quarter of  from million in the first quarter  to million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
revenues from our telecom products and photonics tool products comprised and  respectively  of our total net revenues in the fourth quarter of we expect that our total net revenues in the first quarter of will be within a range of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced that we were transferring more production to our offshore manufacturing facility in shenzhen  china 
however  in march  we decided and announced that we will divest operations related to the manufacture and sale of passive components 
as a part of this action  we will cease operations at our  square foot manufacturing facility in shenzhen  china after fulfillment of end of life orders from customers 
we plan to discontinue development work on all passive products early in the second quarter of and cease operations at our china manufacturing facility by the end of the second quarter of this product line divestiture and plant closure will reduce our worldwide work force by approximately people 
we expect to record a restructuring charge of million associated with the passives product line divestiture  the china plant closure  and the related work force reductions 
the restructuring charge will be recorded in either the first or second quarter of  or possibly spread over both quarters  in compliance with current accounting rules 
we will continue to develop and market active components  such as tunable lasers  data drivers and clock amplifiers  as well as test and measurement products and photonics tools 
we previously announced the planned closure of our camarillo  california manufacturing facility by the early part of the third quarter of the work force reduction associated with this action involves approximately people 
combined with the additional work force reduction associated with the divestiture of our passives product line  our headcount will drop to people in the fourth quarter of  down from approximately employees at end of the fourth quarter of and down from the peak employment level of approximately  people in february after closure of the camarillo and china plants  the company will occupy  square feet of facilities  down from  square feet at the start of net revenues from the sale of our passive products were million  or of total net revenues  for the year ended december   million  or of total net revenues for the year ended december   and million  or of total net revenues  for the nine months ended december  recently  quarterly net revenues from passive products declined from million  or of total net revenues  in the fourth quarter of fiscal to million  or of total net revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal at december   our investment in our passives product line and our china manufacturing facility totaled million  comprised of million for land and building and million for equipment 
we expect to lower the company s expense structure  defined as operating expense and manufacturing overhead  by an estimated million per quarter as a result of the closure of the china facility and the elimination of development costs for passive products 
the closure of the camarillo facility and reductions in certain support activities should produce approximately million in additional quarterly cost savings 
when combined with the approximately million in savings realized in the second half of  these actions are expected to yield an million reduction in the company s quarterly expense structure between the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of at revenue levels comparable to the fourth quarter of  our quarterly net loss will be cut by more than upon realization of the projected savings 
additionally  the quarterly net revenues required to achieve profitability should drop to million from the million level previously announced due to the lower expense structure now forecasted for the fourth quarter of we expect difficult conditions within the telecommunications market to continue for the balance of and well into although our planned divestiture of our passives product line and the closing of our offshore manufacturing operations will accelerate the realization of cost savings  in light of the market conditions  it is unlikely that we will be able to generate million in quarterly revenues from our current product lines 
consequently  we intend to seek strategic acquisition opportunities to grow our revenues and diversify our product portfolio 
in addition  we will continue to review our various lines of business and will adjust our cost reduction plans and business strategies to fit market realities 
statement of operations we sell and market our telecom products primarily through our direct sales force 
to date  most of our direct sales have been in north america  however  we also sell and market our telecom products internationally  principally in europe 
we sell and market our photonics tools products through a combination of direct sales  catalog sales and international sales representatives and resellers  primarily in the united states  europe and asia 
for the year ended december   of our net revenues were from international sales 
of our international sales  were from telecom products and were from photonics tools products 
our cost of net revenues consists of raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  which includes  among other costs  production start up  prototype costs and inventory write down costs 
in addition  we rely on contract manufacturers for some of our key components  which are included in our cost of net revenues 
as a result of our planned closure of our shenzhen  china facility and divestiture of our passives product line in  we will be relying more on contract manufacturers for completion of our end products 
in addition  with the reduction in costs resulting from our planned closures of our camarillo and china facilities  we anticipate improved gross margins at comparable revenues levels 
our product development efforts focus on our telecom products  particularly high speed opto electronics and innovative fiber optic products  which will enable us to offer next generation products in volume 
due to our emphasis on telecom products in recent years  we have not historically spent significant amounts on research and development efforts for photonics tools 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  materials costs and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
in addition  from time to time  we receive funding for research and development projects 
for fiscal year  fiscal year and the nine month period ended december   we received million   and million  respectively  for research and development activities  which was used to offset research and development costs 
we have made  and will continue to make  a substantial investment in research and development 
at the same time  however  we plan to reduce our research and development spending to a rate of million per quarter by the end of in order to more closely align development expenses with recent changes in new product plans and with our revenues expectations for in addition  we plan to establish strategic development partnerships that will help reduce telecom research and development expenses  particularly in regard to the development of network tunable lasers 
we anticipate that research and development spending with respect to our photonics tools business will increase as we execute our business strategy  however  the level of research and development expenditure required for photonics tools is significantly lower than that required for telecom products 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer engineering support functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows  promotional activities and travel expenses 
we believe our future success depends upon establishing successful relationships with a variety of key customers  and that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to maintaining presence at customers 
at the same time  however  we anticipate reducing our expenses in order to more closely align sales and marketing expenses with our revenues expectations for general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human resources personnel  corporate related expenses associated with operating as a public company  professional fees and costs associated with maintaining our information systems 
in connection with the acquisitions of jca and globe y  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million through december   representing the value of restricted stock issued subject to forfeiture 
these amounts are being amortized using the graded vesting method over the two year vesting period of the restricted stock 
acquisitions on january   we acquired jca technology  inc  a designer  manufacturer and marketer of a full line of fiber optic products for oc and oc modulators  including high speed clock amplifiers and broadband data driver amplifiers  for a total purchase price of approximately million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the consideration consisted of million in cash and approximately  shares of our common stock for a combined total fair value of million in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of jca 
in addition  we issued approximately  shares of restricted stock subject to forfeiture 
we recorded million of unearned compensation related to the issuance of approximately  shares of restricted stock 
vesting for the remaining  shares of restricted stock was contingent upon meeting certain fiscal operating objectives 
these shares were forfeited in september when the objectives were not met 
jca operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of new focus  and our financial statements for the year ended december  include the results of operations for jca subsequent to january  on february   we acquired globe y 
technology  inc  a manufacturer of fused fiber coupling machines  for a total purchase price of approximately million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the consideration consisted of approximately  shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of globe y 
in addition  we recorded approximately million of unearned compensation related to the issuance of approximately  shares of restricted stock subject to forfeiture 
globe y operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of new focus  and our financial statements for the year ended december  include the results of operations for globe y subsequent to february  critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of new focus consolidated financial statements inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out method or market estimated net realizable value 
we generally plan production based on orders received and forecasted demand 
we also maintain a stock of certain products for our photonics tools business 
we must order components and build inventories well in advance of product shipments 
these estimates are dependent on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers  including consideration that orders are subject to cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment 
as our markets are volatile  and are subject to technological risks and price changes as well as inventory reduction programs by our customers  there is a risk that we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess inventories of particular products 
the inventory risk is compounded for telecom products  because many of our customers place orders with short lead times 
as a result  actual demand will differ from forecasts  and such a difference may have a material adverse effect on actual results of operations 
in  we incurred charges related to excess inventory write downs and related order cancellation fees of million due to the abrupt and severe downturn in the telecommunications industry in the excess inventory write down and related order cancellation fees were calculated in accordance with our policy  which is based on inventory levels in excess of estimated six month demand and our judgment for each specific product 
should actual demand differ from our estimates  revisions to our excess inventory write down would be required 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   we had million of other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
during  we wrote off million of goodwill 
at december   there was no remaining goodwill 
restructuring 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in related to a workforce reduction  facility closure and write down of leasehold improvements and equipment 
at december  we had a remaining accrual of million 
the restructuring accrual contains estimates for facilities lease losses and equipment salvage values  and may require an adjustment if actual results differ  which could materially affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
results of operations you should be aware that we changed our fiscal year end to december in december our previous fiscal years ended march beginning in  we maintain a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year cycle ending on the sunday closest to december fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  nine months ended december  summary of operations data net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development  net sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles impairment of goodwill in process research and development restructuring and other charges amortization of deferred compensation total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income expense  net loss before provision for income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss fiscal years ended december  and december  and the nine month period ended december  net revenues net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and million for the nine months ended december  primarily as a result of increased sales of our telecom products and  for fiscal  inclusion of sales of products manufactured by jca and globe y made subsequent to our acquisitions of these companies in mid january and mid february  respectively 
we began shipping our telecom products in march sales of our telecom products were million  or of total net revenues  for fiscal year  compared to million  or of total net revenues  for fiscal year and million  or of total net revenues  for the nine month period ended december  sales of our photonics tools products were million  or of total net revenues  for fiscal year  compared to million  or of total net revenues  for fiscal year and million  or of total net revenues  for the nine month period ended december  for the year ended december   agilent technologies and alcatel sa accounted for and of net revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   corvis corporation  agilent technologies and corning incorporated accounted for  and of net revenues  respectively 
no customers accounted for more than of net revenues for the nine month period ended december  gross profit loss gross profit loss percentage  including amortization of deferred compensation expenses  decreased to a loss of in fiscal from a profit of in fiscal and a profit of for the nine month period ended december  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and  respectively  gross profit loss percentage decreased to a loss of for fiscal year from a profit of for fiscal year and a profit of for the nine month period ended december  cost of net revenues for fiscal includes million for the write down of excess inventories and related charges  reflecting lower customer demand for our products and a current lack of order flow resulting from the sudden and sharp decline in capital equipment expenditures by telecommunications carriers 
there were no significant write downs of inventories or related charges during fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage from the nine month period ended december  to fiscal was primarily a result of increased manufacturing overhead costs of approximately million associated with the expansion of our telecom manufacturing operations domestically and internationally 
in addition  increased us manufacturing overhead costs included increases in payroll and related costs for additional manufacturing personnel of approximately million and higher equipment and facility costs of approximately million 
manufacturing overhead costs for our china operations  which began limited production in june and progressively ramped production throughout the third and fourth quarters of  accounted for approximately million of the increase in manufacturing overhead costs in the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses  including amortization of deferred compensation expenses  increased to of net revenues  or million  in fiscal from of net revenues  or million  in fiscal and increased from of net revenues  or million  for the nine month period ended december  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and  respectively  research and development expenses were of net revenues  or million  in fiscal  of net revenues  or million  in fiscal  and of net revenues  or million  for the nine month period ended december  these expenses were incurred primarily in connection with the continued development of existing telecom products and development of new telecom products 
in addition  research and development expenses increased in fiscal due to our acquisition of jca 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  including amortization of deferred compensation expenses  increased to of net revenues  or million  in fiscal from of net revenues  or million  in fiscal and from of net revenues  or million for the nine month period ended december  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and  respectively  sales and marketing expenses increased to of net revenues  or million in fiscal from of net revenues  or million in fiscal and from of net revenues  or million  for the nine month period ended december  sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars in each of these periods as a result of hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  including amortization of deferred compensation expenses  increased to of net revenues  or million  in fiscal from of net revenues  or million  in fiscal and from of net revenues  or million  for the nine month period ended december  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and  respectively  general and administrative expenses increased to of net revenues  or million  in fiscal from of net revenues  or million  in fiscal and from of net revenues  or million  for the nine month period ended december  the increase in absolute spending for general and administrative expenses between the comparable periods was primarily due to increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of domestic and international operations  and corporate related expenses associated with operating as a public company 
in addition  fiscal expenses include significant legal costs  and integration costs associated with our acquisitions of jca and globe y 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and impairment of goodwill amortization of goodwill and other intangibles totaled million in the year ended december   and arose in connection with our acquisitions of jca and globe y in january and february  respectively 
goodwill was being amortized over estimated useful lives of four years and other intangibles are being amortized over estimated useful lives of two to four years 
due to the circumstances created by the significant downturn in the telecommunications market  we recorded impairment charges against the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of jca and globe y in the downturn has negatively impacted the forecasted revenues and cash flows from the jca and globe y businesses 
in accordance with our policy  undiscounted cash flows indicated that the assets were impaired 
an independent appraiser verified our calculation of the impairment charges by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets  based on future discounted cash flow expectations from these acquired businesses  to the carrying amount of the related intangible assets 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows was based on the company s weighted average cost of capital  which represents the blended after tax costs of debt and equity 
this resulted in write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets totaling million during at december   there was no remaining goodwill balance associated with the acquisitions of jca and globe y  and net other intangible assets totaled million 
in process research and development a million in process research and development charge related to our acquisition of jca was recorded in the year ended december  in process research and development represents the value assigned in a purchase business combination to research and development activities of the acquired business that had not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
restructuring and other charges in we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for actions taken to resize our operations as a result of a decline in demand for our products 
these restructuring activities include closing and consolidating our older santa clara  california facility and our smaller shenzhen  china production facility into larger  existing facilities in san jose and shenzhen  respectively  and the anticipated subleasing of a previously unoccupied facility in camarillo  california 
restructuring activities also include the planned closing of our remaining manufacturing site in camarillo  california in the third quarter of and the transfer of production from this operation to other facilities 
additionally  we reduced our workforce in our us and china operations by approximately  employees from a peak of  in february to approximately in december through a combination of reduction in force programs and attrition 
the restructuring charges included million for severance costs covering approximately employees including approximately employees associated with the planned closing of the camarillo facility in  million for the write down of the net book value of impaired leasehold improvements and equipment  and million for facility closure costs 
non cash items included in the restructuring charges totaled million 
as of december   million in accrued restructuring costs  consisting of million for facility closure costs and million for severance costs  remained in current liabilities 
recent decisions to divest our passives product line and close our larger shenzhen  china facility will result in additional restructuring charges in estimated to be million 
we plan to reduce our worldwide workforce by approximately people to a total of approximately employees by the end of we will continue to review our various lines of business and will adjust our cost reduction plans and business strategies to fit market realities 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense netted to an income of million in fiscal  an income of million in fiscal and an expense of  for the nine month period ended december  interest income was the largest component of these amounts in fiscal and  totaling million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest income in and was primarily due to interest earned on the million in proceeds from the combination of our may initial public offering and august follow on public offering  net of cash consumed 
interest income was the largest component of the amounts for the nine month period ended december   totaling  the interest expense for this period consisted of interest on debt and capital lease obligations 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes of approximately million for the year ended december  relates to the deferred tax benefit associated with the amortization of the other identifiable intangible assets and deferred compensation resulting from the acquisitions of jca and globe y 
this benefit has been offset by minimal amounts of alternative minimum taxes and withholding taxes 
the provision for income taxes of approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the nine month period ended december  consists of current state minimum taxes and withholding taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes and million and million of federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
the net operating loss and federal tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of loss carryforwards for these periods or for any other periods since inception 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of the assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which included our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the year ended december  was primarily due to million spent on the acquisitions of jca and globe y and million spent for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and operating cash outflow of million 
the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the year ended december  was primarily due to cash generated by financing activities  including the receipt of million from our initial and follow on public offerings  partially offset by million of cash used in operations and million of cash used to purchase property and equipment 
net working capital decreased by million for fiscal cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in the nine month period ended december  cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to our net loss excluding non cash charges of million and decreases in accounts payable of million  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories of million 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to increases in inventories of million  increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and our net loss excluding non cash charges of million  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling million 
cash used in operating activities in the nine month period ended december   was primarily due to our net loss excluding non cash charges of million  increases in inventories of million and accounts receivable of million  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
cash used in investing activities  excluding net purchases of available for sale investments  was million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the nine month period ended december  in fiscal  we used million to acquire jca and globe y and million to acquire property  plant and equipment 
in fiscal and the nine month period ended december   cash used in investing activities was primarily to acquire property  plant and equipment 
cash generated by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in the nine month period ended december  cash generated by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily due to proceeds from sales of stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash generated by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily due to proceeds of million from our initial and follow on public offerings of common stock 
cash generated by financing activities in the nine month period ended december   was primarily due to proceeds of million from the sales of convertible preferred stock and million under our bank lending facilities  partially offset by million of repayments of our bank lending facilities  an equipment loan and promissory notes 
we substantially reduced our quarterly capital expenditures from approximately million in the first quarter of to approximately  in the fourth quarter of we expect that our capital expenditures will continue to be minimal throughout we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we have no material contractual obligations or commercial commitments other than future minimum payments under our facilities operating leases  which total million through recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we are required to apply both standards at the beginning of fiscal fas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  thereby eliminating the pooling of interests method 
in addition  fas further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of fas are effective for any business combination initiated after june  under fas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
the amortization provisions of fas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  management does not expect the adoption of either fas or fas to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows  because at december   goodwill had been written off through impairment charges 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  and supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
fas provides a single model for accounting and reporting the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the statement also sets new criteria for the classification of assets held for sale and changes the reporting of discontinued operations 
management does not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we currently do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds 
our short term investments consist of debt securities such as commercial paper  corporate bonds and notes  euro dollar bonds and asset backed securities with original maturity dates between three months and one year 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  with a weighted average interest rate of 
our short term investments totaled million  with a weighted average interest rate of 
exchange rate sensitivity a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily the chinese yuan renminbi cny 
since late  the cny has been trading at a conversion rate of approximately cny to the us dollar 
based on fiscal expenses that were denominated in cny  an adverse change in exchange rates defined as in the cny to the us dollar rate would result in a decline in income before taxes of approximately million
