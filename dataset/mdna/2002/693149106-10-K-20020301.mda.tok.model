 unaudited in thousands  except earnings per share data operating revenues         total operating expenses         operating income         net income         earnings per common share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources during  we generated million in cash from operating activities compared to million and million in and  respectively 
investing activities used million in cash during compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the cash used in all three years related primarily to the purchase of revenue equipment tractors and trailers used in our operations 
financing activities generated million in cash during compared to cash used in financing activities of million in and cash generated by financing activities of million in in all three years  the cash used as generated in financing activities was primarily from long term borrowings incurred to finance the purchase of revenue equipment used in our operations 
our primary use of funds is for the purchase of revenue equipment 
we typically finance the acquisition of revenue equipment through installment notes with fixed interest rates and terms ranging from to months 
at december   we had outstanding indebtedness under such installment notes of million 
as of february   we had million in outstanding indebtedness under such installment notes  with various maturity dates through march  the weighted average interest rates on these installment notes were  and for  and  respectively 
we also maintain two million revolving lines of credit line a and line b with separate financial institutions 
amounts outstanding under line a bear interest at libor on the first day of the month plus  are secured by our accounts receivable and mature on may  at december   million was outstanding under line a and at february   million was outstanding under line a including million in letters of credit  with availability to borrow million 
amounts outstanding under line b bear interest at libor on the last day of the previous month plus  are secured by revenue equipment and mature on november  at december  and february   line b was fully utilized with million outstanding 
in an effort to reduce interest rate risk associated with these floating rate facilities  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of million 
for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements  see item a of this report 
we occasionally use our existing lines of credit on an interim basis  in addition to cash flows from operations  to finance capital expenditures and repay long term debt 
although we typically utilize long term installment notes to finance purchases of revenue equipment  during and  we utilized cash on hand and our lines of credit to finance revenue equipment purchases for an aggregate of million and million  respectively 
on february   we filed a registration statement for the public sale of  shares of our common stock  representing  shares to be sold by us and  shares to be sold by certain of our stockholders 
if the offering is completed  we expect to receive net proceeds from the  shares proposed to be sold by us  after deducting underwriting commissions and estimated expenses  of approximately million we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
we intend to use approximately million of the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under installment notes and approximately million to reduce our indebtedness under line a 
for  we expect to purchase approximately new tractors and approximately trailers while continuing to sell or trade older equipment  which we expect to result in net capital expenditures of approximately million 
we are also in the process of expanding our corporate headquarters at our main facility in tontitown  arkansas 
we expect the expansion to cost approximately million  which we expect to finance from cash on hand and advances under line a 
on january   we entered into a non binding letter of intent to purchase for cash certain assets of east coast transport  inc  a freight brokerage operation based in paulsboro  new jersey 
consummation of the transaction is subject to the satisfactory completion of a due diligence investigation  negotiation of a definitive agreement and receipt of various regulatory approvals 
if the transaction is completed  we do not expect the ultimate purchase price to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial condition 
regardless of whether we consummate the proposed acquisition of east coast transport or the proposed public stock offering  we expect that our working capital and available credit under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and fund our operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
insurance auto liability and collision coverage are subject to a  deductible per occurrence while cargo loss coverage has a  deductible 
we maintain a reserve for estimated losses for claims incurred  and maintain a reserve for claims incurred but not reported based on our historical experience 
we are insured for workers compensation claims in excess of  we have reserved for estimated losses to pay such claims as incurred as well as claims incurred but not reported 
we have not experienced any adverse trends involving differences in claims experienced versus claims estimates for workers compensation reserves 
letters of credit are held by a bank as security for workers compensation claims in arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi  and florida  and two letters of credit are held by a bank for auto liability claims 
insurance carriers have recently begun to raise premiums for most trucking companies 
we experienced an increase of approximately million in insurance premiums for and could experience additional increases after our current coverage expires in december seasonality our revenues do not exhibit a significant seasonal pattern  due primarily to our varied customer mix 
operating expenses can be somewhat higher in the winter months  primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs associated with inclement weather 
in addition  the automobile plants for which we transport a large amount of freight typically utilize scheduled shutdowns of two weeks in july and one week in december and the volume of freight we ship is reduced during such scheduled plant shutdowns 
inflation inflation has an impact on most of our operating costs 
recently  the effect of inflation has been minimal 
competition for drivers has increased in recent years  leading to increased labor costs 
while increases in fuel and driver costs affect our operating costs  the effects of such increases are not greater for us than for other trucking concerns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risk exposures include commodity price risk the price paid to obtain diesel fuel for our tractors and interest rate risk 
the potential adverse impact of these risks and the general strategies we employ to manage such risks are discussed below 
the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that an adverse change may have on the overall economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results of changes in prices or rates may differ materially from the hypothetical results described below 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside of our control 
accordingly  the price and availability of diesel fuel  as well as other petroleum products  can be unpredictable 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for and  fuel expenses represented and  respectively  of our total operating expenses 
based upon our fuel consumption  a increase in the average annual price per gallon of diesel fuel would increase our annual fuel expenses by million 
in august and july  we entered into agreements to obtain price protection and reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
under these agreements  we were obligated to purchase minimum amounts of diesel fuel per month  with a price protection component  for the six month periods ended march  and february  the agreements also provide that if during the months commencing april  the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange ny mx ho falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay  for a maximum of twelve different months selected by the contract holder during such month period  the difference between 
per gallon and ny mx ho average price  multiplied by  gallons 
accordingly  in any month in which the holder exercises such right  we would be obligated to pay the holder  for each cent by which 
exceeds the average ny mx ho price for that month 
for example  the ny mx ho average price during february was approximately  and if the holder were to exercise its payment right  we would be obligated to pay the holder approximately  in addition  if during any month in the twelve month period commencing january  the average ny mx ho is below 
per gallon  we will be obligated to pay the contract holder the difference between 
and the average ny mx ho price for such month  multiplied by  gallons 
interest rate risk our two million lines of credit each bear interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus a fixed percentage 
accordingly  changes in libor  which are effected by changes in interest rates generally  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  the lines of credit 
in an effort to manage the risks associated with changing interest rates  we entered into interest rate swap agreements effective february  and may   on notional amounts of  and  respectively 
the pay fixed rates under the  and  swap agreements are and  respectively 
the receive floating rate for both swap agreements is month libor 
these interest rate swap agreements terminate on march  and june   respectively 
assuming million of variable rate debt was outstanding under each of line a and line b for a full fiscal year  a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would result in approximately  of additional interest expense  net of the effect of the swap agreements
