item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the financial statements and the related notes referenced elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide comprehensive fibre channel based interconnect products and embedded switch products for data storage solutions and storage networking applications 
our offering consists of a variety of switch and hub products that connect computers to data storage devices in a network configuration and a switch on a chip application specific integrated circuit  or asic 
this asic can be embedded in a variety of data storage devices to enhance performance  improve availability  and increase the reliability of these devices 
this new switching technology can be sold in chip  blade or box form to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  for inclusion in their solutions 
we incorporated in colorado in june under the name photonics research incorporated and initially developed fiber optic components for data communications and related applications 
in february  we reincorporated in delaware and changed our name to vixel corporation 
in the first quarter of  we acquired the fibre channel hub and transceiver product lines from western digital corporation 
in we began developing our san insite software to manage our san interconnect solutions 
in the first quarter of  we acquired arcxel technologies  inc  a developer of fibre channel switches 
in early  we sold our laser diode fabrication facility and gigabit ethernet transceiver product line to cielo communications  inc  and since that time we have been focused exclusively on designing  developing and marketing our fibre channel solutions 
during  we used our expertise in fibre channel switching technologies to develop a switch on a chip asic 
this asic incorporates our inspeed technology  which is an advanced switching architecture that results in a single chip capable of handling multiple fibre channel devices 
this asic can be embedded into storage enclosure devices such as redundant array of independent disks  or raid  enclosures  tape libraries  nas environments and next generation storage systems to enhance the performance and scaling of these solutions as well as improve device availability and reliability 
we are also using this asic in fibre channel switches and blades that can be embedded by oems in their storage solutions 
as part of our embedded storage switch strategy  we have licensed the manufacturing and selling of our fibre channel switch asics 
this technology can also be used to offer high performance  low cost switches for entry level sans 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized our first royalty revenue with regards to the licensing of these products 
revenue from inspeed based products represented approximately of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of fibre channel products  including switches  hubs  and embedded storage switch products 
we have developed a version of our san insite software  san insite professional that we license for a fee 
san systems revenue consists of revenue generated from sales of our san switches  hubs  transceiver products sold as a result of selling our switches and hubs and the sales 
table of contents and licensing of our embedded switching technology 
component revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from the sale of our transceiver products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  for use in their products 
during the second quarter of  we discontinued the manufacture and sale of our transceiver products 
also  we are currently evaluating strategic alternatives for our san insite software and the related assets and resources 
we sell our products primarily to a limited number of oems 
sun microsystems  compaq computer and avid technology represented  and of revenue  respectively  for fiscal compaq computer and sun microsystems represented and of revenue  respectively  for fiscal no other individual customer represented more than of our total revenue in those periods 
while we are seeking to diversify our customer base and expand the portion of our revenue that is derived from sales through various distribution channels  we anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on volume sales to a relatively small number of oems 
we may not be successful in our efforts to diversify our customer base and the loss of one of our key customers could significantly reduce our total revenue 
during fiscal and  and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from sales to distribution channel customers 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue is affected by the mix of products sold  sales channels and customers to which our products are sold 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue also is affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes and component costs  manufacturing costs charged by our contract manufacturers  new product introductions  changes in our product pricing and estimated warranty costs 
we expect that average unit selling prices for our products will decline over time in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and other factors 
we seek to maintain gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by selling a higher percentage of higher margin products  reducing the cost of our products through manufacturing efficiencies  design improvements and cost reductions for components and leveraging our internal operations infrastructure 
since september  we have outsourced our product manufacturing to one contract manufacturer  suntron corporation  formally k tec electronics corporation 
suntron also provides distribution and repair operations and most of our materials management 
we purchase certain components directly from suppliers and resell them to suntron at our cost and recognize no revenue from these transactions 
we also outsource the manufacturing of our asics to third party manufacturers that ship these components to suntron for assembly 
in addition  we have recently developed a fibre channel embedded switch asic for use in various storage devices 
we have licensed the manufacturing and selling of this asic to a third party and will derive royalty revenue from such sales 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants during  we recorded stock based compensation of million 
stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity 
the balance is expensed on a graded vesting method over the vesting period of the options 
during fiscal and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of the stock based compensation as compensation expense 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had operating loss carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes 
these operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the gross deferred tax asset balance because our accumulated deficit  history of recurring net losses and possible limitations on the use of carryforwards give rise to uncertainty as to whether the deferred tax assets are realizable 
further  these operating loss carryforwards could be subject to usage limitations due to changes in our ownership resulting from equity financings 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and have never been profitable 
we reduced our work force in and took other steps to better align our operating expenses with our revenue levels 
we plan to grow our revenue base and to continue to control our expenses in order to achieve profitability 
however  we cannot be certain that we will ever realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 

table of contents critical accounting policies we generally recognize revenue at the time of product shipment  unless we have future obligations for installation or when we ship product demonstration units 
revenue from products shipped with future installation obligations is recognized when we meet our future obligation 
revenue is not recognized on demonstration units unless the customer ultimately purchases the unit  and the related revenue is recognized at that time 
our agreement with our north american distributors provides for price protection and for stock rotation based on a percentage of shipments for the quarter preceding when an offsetting order is requested 
revenue for the percentage of shipments subject to these stock rotation rights is deferred until the stock rotation period has passed 
we provide an allowance for price protection rights 
we also maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on a combination of historical experience and specifically identified potential warranty liabilities 
we receive royalty revenue under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product 
we record royalty revenue based on sales reported to us by the licensee that occurred during the relevant period 
there are no future performance obligations under these license agreements 
we offer product warranties of one to five years 
estimated future warranty obligations related to certain products are provided by charges to operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
these estimates are based on historical warranty experience and other relevant information of which we are aware 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
amounts in the financial statements  which are particularly susceptible to changes in estimates in the near term  include the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles and the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  sales returns  inventory obsolescence and product warranty costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of revenue  statement of operations data for the periods indicated for the fiscal year ended january  december  december  revenue san systems components total revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net net loss 
table of contents fiscal years ended january   december  and december  revenue 
total revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our san systems revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in san systems revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal was the result of increased sales of our switch products 
the decrease in san systems revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily a result of a decrease in entry level hub product sales and a decrease in the sales of our transceiver products with our switch and hub products as a result of us discontinuing the manufacturing and selling of transceiver products in the second quarter of component and other revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
performance issues with our cd based transceiver products sold primarily in were identified in late and early and  combined with certain other warranty issues with our gigabaud link modules  or glm  transceiver products resulted in a decrease in the purchases of our component products in fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase in component revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal is a result of a one time order of a transceiver product from one of our oem customers 
during the second quarter of  we discontinued the manufacture and sale of our transceiver products 
gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the cost to acquire finished products from third party manufacturers of our products  expenses we incur related to inventory management  product quality testing and customer order fulfillment  and provisions for warranty expenses and inventory obsolescence 
gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increases in both absolute dollars and percentage of total revenue in  as compared with  reflect a change in our product mix as sales of switch and hub products increased while sales of transceivers declined 
our switch and hub products generally have higher gross margins than our transceiver products 
the decrease in the amount of gross profit in compared with is directly related to the decreased revenue in compared with cost of revenue during fiscal was reduced by million as a result of the settlement of warranty related claims against a third party vendor 
also  included in cost of revenue during fiscal were provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and purchase commitments totaling approximately million  reduced by  resulting from the settlement of a patent infringement claim related to our gbic transceivers for less than previously estimated 
these provisions resulted primarily from transitioning out of the gbic and glm transceiver products and less than originally forecasted sales of certain of our products 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past  our contract manufacturer builds inventory levels for certain components with long lead times and enters into certain longer term commitments for certain components 
due to the transition out of our transceiver products and a faster than anticipated shift in demand from older to newer generation san system products  inventory levels for these products exceeded our requirements 
the excess and obsolete inventory charge was calculated based on the inventory levels in excess of demand for each specific product 
we do not anticipate that the excess inventory subject to this charge will be used at a later date 
we have entered into agreements with third parties to market and or sell our switch asic products 
as a result of these agreements  future revenue from our asic products will primarily be in the form of royalties received from these third parties 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenue to increase in as a result of anticipated royalty revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development and sustaining engineering of our products  consulting and outside service fees  costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was due to increased development costs relating to our management software and switch products and two development agreements with third parties to embed our switch or asic technology into their products 
the decrease in research 
table of contents and development expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was the result of a decrease in consulting and temporary services with regard to the series switch design and development  as well as a decrease in software development consulting for our san insite professional product  both of which were completed during we expect the absolute dollar amounts of research and development expense will decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal however  we believe that continued investment in research and development is an essential element of our strategic objectives to design quality products while reducing costs and to leverage our technologies into new market opportunities 
as a result  we expect these expenses to continue to represent a significant percentage of our future revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales  finance and information technology support functions  as well as professional fees  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  trade shows and other marketing activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to increases in sales and customer service and support personnel in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was mainly due to a reduction in bad debt expense  a reduction in travel  recruitment and relocation expenses due to a reduction in force during and a reduction of marketing expenses such as trade show expense  cooperative marketing expense and advertising development and placement expenses 
we currently anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we continue to manage costs  maximize operating efficiencies and leverage our current infrastructure 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles in fiscal  and was million  million and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of total revenue 
the increase in fiscal compared with fiscal is the result of an increase in the amortization of the intangible assets capitalized in conjunction with our purchase of arcxel technologies in february the decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal  resulted from the intangible assets being fully amortized during fiscal amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  as a result of stock options granted to employees and consultants during fiscal for which we recorded stock based compensation of million 
the remaining balance of deferred stock based compensation will be amortized during fiscal and in the amounts of  and  respectively 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  consists of interest income  interest expense and other miscellaneous income or expense 
other expense  net  was  in fiscal  and other income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal other expense  net in fiscal was primarily interest expense 
other income  net in fiscal and fiscal was primarily interest income relating to our short term investments 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock and preferred stock with aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  we have financed our operations through capital equipment lease lines  working capital credit facilities  notes payable and million in net cash received from the sale of our laser diode fabrication facility and gigabit ethernet product line 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives for our san insite software and related assets and resources 
depending on the outcome of this strategic evaluation  we may be able to increase our cash resources to use in financing our future operations 
however  we cannot be certain that such a strategic alternative will be available to us 

table of contents cash utilized by operating activities was million in fiscal  due to net losses  as well as working capital required to fund our operations 
cash provided by investing activities was million  primarily related to maturities of short term investments  net of purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures of million 
cash used in financing activities was  primarily due to payments on our capital leases and purchases of treasury stock  net of payments received on our stockholder notes receivable and common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and have never been profitable 
we reduced our work force in and may do so again in depending on the results of our evaluation of strategic alternatives for san insite or by further aligning our resources to execute our strategies 
we plan to grow our revenue base and to continue to control our expenses in order to achieve profitability 
however we cannot be certain that we will ever realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve to eighteen months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our future revenue  our strategic decisions concerning san insite business  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and sales  general and administrative activities  the timing of introductions of new products  and market acceptance of our products 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fas no 
 business combinations  and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas supersedes accounting principles bulletin no 
 business combinations and fas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises and fas supersedes accounting principles bulletin no 
 intangible assets 
these statements require use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after july   thereby eliminating use of the pooling of interests method 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually 
additionally  new criteria have been established that determine whether an acquired intangible asset should be recognized separately from goodwill 
we will adopt these pronouncements on a prospective basis in fiscal  as required 
we do not expect this accounting pronouncement to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fas no 
accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
the provisions of fas apply to all entities that incur obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  and will become effective for us commencing with fiscal year we do not expect this accounting pronouncement to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of fas are to address issues relating to the implementation of fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and will become effective for us commencing with fiscal year we do not expect this accounting pronouncement to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we have incurred significant losses since our inception  we expect future losses  and we may not become profitable 
we have incurred significant losses since inception  most recently a net loss of million for fiscal year  and expect to incur losses in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses  and we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we cannot be certain that we ever will realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability and even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
our operating results are difficult to forecast  may fluctuate on a quarterly basis and may be adversely affected by many factors  which may result in volatility in our stock price 
our revenue and results of operations have varied on a quarterly basis in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
some of the factors that could affect our operating results include the size  terms and fluctuations of customer orders  particularly orders from a limited number of oems  changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in the computer storage and networking industries  including changes in spending levels for information technology products  the timing of customer orders  a large percentage of which are generated in the last month of each quarter  our ability to attain and maintain sufficient reliability levels for our products  our ability to develop and market new products  the results of our evaluation of strategic alternatives for our san insite software and related assets and resources  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of products by us  our oems and our competitors  decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  and the ability of our contract manufacturer to produce and distribute our products in a timely fashion 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below our guidance  your expectations or the expectations of public market analysts 
our oems have unpredictable order patterns  which may cause our revenue to vary significantly from period to period 
our oems tend to order sporadically  and their purchases can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our oems generally forecast expected purchases in advance  but frequently do not order as expected and tend to place purchase orders only shortly before the scheduled delivery date 
we plan our operating expenses based in part on revenue projections derived from our oems forecasts 
because most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue 
these typical ordering practices cause our backlog to fluctuate significantly 
moreover  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period  as orders are subject to cancellation or delay by our oems with limited or no penalty 

table of contents the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenue 
our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant oems  resellers and integrators  as well as on the sales efforts and success of these customers 
revenue from sun microsystems  compaq computer and avid technology  represented  and of our total revenue  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  although we are attempting to expand our base of oems and resellers  most of our future revenue may come from a small number of customers 
our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales to those customers 
for example our oem and reseller agreements are not exclusive and contain no renewal obligation  our oems and resellers can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time  and our oem and reseller agreements do not require minimum purchases 
we cannot be certain that we will retain our current oems and resellers or that we will be able to recruit additional or replacement customers 
many of our oems and resellers carry or utilize competing product lines 
if we were to lose one or more oems or resellers to a competitor  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed significantly 
our success is dependent upon acceptance of our fibre channel technology and the growth of the storage market 
our products are used exclusively in storage devices and sans 
accordingly  widespread adoption of remote storage and sans is critical to our future success 
these markets are evolving rapidly  and it is difficult to predict their potential size or future growth rate 
our success in generating revenue in the markets will depend on  among other things  our ability to demonstrate the benefits of sans and our san switch and hub products and embedded switch products to oems  resellers and end users  enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis to meet changes in customer preferences and evolving industry standards  develop  maintain and build relationships with leading oems and resellers  and accurately predict the direction of industry standards and base our products on those industry standards 
our failure to do any of these activities would adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in these markets 
competing technologies may emerge and we may fail to adopt new technologies on a timely basis 
failure to utilize new technologies may decrease the demand for our products 
emerging technologies  such as ethernet ip  scsi small computer system interface over ip and infiniband are potential competing alternatives to fibre channel 
if we are unable to identify new technologies in a timely manner and efficiently utilize such new technologies in our product development efforts  the demand for our current products may decrease significantly and rapidly  which would harm our business 
we expect that a growing percentage of our future revenue will be derived from our san interconnect switch products  our inspeed technology based products  and royalties from technology development agreements with customers  and our success will depend on widespread acceptance of these products and technologies and our ability to manage transition from older product inventories 
our future revenue growth will depend on the success of our new products and product launches by customers for which we have developed  or are developing  products under technology development 
table of contents agreements 
in addition  as we introduce new or enhanced products  such as our inspeed based products  we will have to manage successfully the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in our customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet our customers demands 
to the extent customers defer or cancel orders in expectation of new product releases  any delay in development or introduction of new products could cause our operating results to suffer 
because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales of entry level hubs  we are dependent on continued widespread market acceptance of these products 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales of our entry level hubs 
although we anticipate our revenue from sales of entry level hubs to decline as management of san products becomes more important in larger  more complex san implementations  we expect that revenue from our entry level hubs will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
if the market does not continue to accept our entry level hubs  or if our revenue from entry level hubs decreases more rapidly than we anticipate  our total revenue may not grow or may decline significantly 
competition in our markets may lead to reduced prices and sales of our products  increased losses and reduced market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the san market 
the markets for san interconnect products are highly competitive 
our current competitors include a number of domestic and international companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
we expect that more companies  including our customers  may enter the market for san interconnect products 
we may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors 
increased competition could result in significant price erosion  reduced revenue  lower margins or loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for san interconnect switch sales  we compete primarily with brocade communications  mcdata  qlogic corporation and gadzoox networks 
for hub sales  we compete primarily with emulex corporation and gadzoox networks 
our competitors continue to introduce improved products with lower prices  and we will have to do the same to remain competitive 
furthermore  our customers or larger companies in other related industries may develop or acquire technologies and apply their significant resources  including their distribution channels and brand recognition  to capture significant san market share 
our embedded switches are targeted at a new and evolving market for this technology 
as yet  no fibre channel switch providers have introduced similar technology to our inspeed range of products 
as this market grows we may face competition from legacy switch providers  or oems may choose to develop competing technology themselves 
our failure to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis could cause our revenue to fall 
given the product life cycles in the markets for our products  any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could significantly harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to develop  manufacture and market these new products or other product enhancements in a timely manner or in a manner that will achieve market acceptance 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements  or to license these new technologies from third parties 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing oem product specifications  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  
table of contents difficulties with independent contractors or development partners  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
the sales cycle for our products are long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses and devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated or at all 
oems and resellers typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they begin to market and sell new solutions that include our products 
this evaluation process is lengthy and may range from six months to one year or more 
this process is complex and may require significant sales  marketing and management efforts on our part 
this process becomes more complex as we simultaneously qualify our products with multiple customers 
as a result  we may expend significant resources to develop customer relationships before we recognize any revenue from these relationships  or we may never realize any revenue from these efforts  or recognize revenue when anticipated 
failure to manage our oem and reseller relationships and expand our distribution channels could significantly reduce our revenue 
we rely on oems and resellers  and vitesse semiconductor in the case of our inspeed based asics  to distribute and sell our products 
our success depends substantially on our ability to initiate  manage and expand our relationships with oems  our ability to attract additional resellers and the sales efforts of these oems and resellers 
our failure to manage and expand our relationships with oems and resellers  or their failure to market our products effectively  could substantially reduce our revenue and seriously harm our business 
any failure by us to successfully execute our distribution strategy will negatively impact our revenue 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding indirect distribution channels through oems and resellers 
our failure to execute this strategy successfully could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease  and our operating results would suffer 
many of our resellers also sell products that compete with our products 
we cannot assure you that our resellers will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
our failure to successfully develop or manage our reseller relationships or their failure to sell our products could reduce our revenue 
the loss of suntron  the failure to forecast accurately demand for our products or to manage successfully our relationship with suntron would negatively affect our business 
we rely on suntron corporation  formally k tec electronics corporation  an outside contract manufacturing firm  to manufacture  store and ship our products 
we share suntron s manufacturing and assembly capacity with numerous companies whose needs may conflict with ours 
if suntron is unable or unwilling to complete production runs for us in the future  or experiences any significant delays in completing production runs or shipping our products  the manufacturing  assembly and sale of our products could be temporarily suspended 
we have in the past experienced delivery problems based on capacity constraints for production  test and material supply 
if our product volume requirements increase  we may find it necessary to augment our manufacturing and assembly capacity by engaging new subcontract manufacturers 
we may not be successful in finding qualified manufacturers that meet our needs 
an interruption in supply of our products  or additional costs incurred to qualify and shift production to an alternative manufacturing and assembly facility  would significantly harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
suntron is not obligated to supply products for us  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order that suntron has accepted 
we place purchase orders with suntron based on periodic forecasts 
while most of the materials used in our products are standard products  some are proprietary and or sole source and 
table of contents require extended lead times 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products and manufacturing capacity or if materials are not available at suntron to meet the demand 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly and depend on the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we also may experience shortages of components from time to time  which could delay the manufacture of our products 
we plan to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we coordinate our efforts with suntron to rapidly achieve volume production 
if we do not effectively manage our relationship with suntron  or if suntron experiences delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
if we are required to or if we choose to change contract manufacturers  we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
we may lose sales if our sole source suppliers fail to meet our needs 
we currently purchase several key components from single sources 
we depend on single sources for our card guides  asics and our microprocessors 
asics are custom designed computer chips that perform specific functions very efficiently 
in addition  we license software from a third party that is incorporated into our switches and hubs 
if we cannot supply products due to a lack of components  or are unable to redesign products with other components in a timely manner  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to forecast accurately the demand for our products  it will negatively affect our business 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for particular components 
as a result  our component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
either of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
undetected software or hardware defects could increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
fibre channel products and management software frequently contain undetected software or hardware defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products are complex and problems may be found from time to time in our existing  new or enhanced products 
our products incorporate components manufactured by third parties 
we have in the past experienced difficulties with quality and reliability of components obtained from third parties  and we could experience similar problems in the future 
in addition  our products are integrated with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
a component in a discontinued product line experienced an abnormally high failure rate  which adversely affected our sales and could in the future affect our operating results 
we observed  and some customers confirmed  that in certain applications our gbic and glm transceivers manufactured prior to march that incorporated a third party cd laser experienced an abnormally high failure rate 
as a result of this problem  we recorded a warranty reserve of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal although we have settled claims by customers that purchased the majority of these products  there is a risk that additional claims could occur and that the total amount reserved may be inadequate to cover all potential claims 
claims against us in excess of the amount of our reserves could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we discontinued the manufacturing and selling of our transceiver products during the second quarter of if we fail to successfully develop and maintain the vixel brand  our revenue may not grow and our stock price may fall 
we believe that establishing and maintaining the vixel brand is a critical aspect of our efforts to maintain and develop strategic oem and reseller relationships  and that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the growing number of vendors of san interconnect products 
if we fail to promote our brand successfully  or if we incur excessive expenses in an attempt to promote and maintain the vixel brand  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if our oems  resellers and end users of our products do not perceive our products to be of high quality  or if we introduce new products or technologies that are not accepted by the market  the value of the vixel brand will decline and our business will suffer 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire and integrate qualified personnel  we may not be successful 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued joint contributions of our senior management  including james m 
mccluney  president and chief executive officer  kurtis l 
adams  chief financial officer  stuart b 
berman  chief technology officer  and thomas hughes  vice president  product development 
the loss of one or more of our senior management personnel could harm our sales or delay our product development efforts 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  technical  sales and marketing  finance and operations personnel 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel could have a negative impact on our business 
many of our employees have only recently joined us 
if we are unable to integrate new employees in a timely and cost effective manner  our operating results may suffer 
we also need to increase the number of technical staff members with experience in high speed networking applications and asic design as we further develop our product line 
competition for these highly skilled employees in our industry is intense 
our failure to attract and retain these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  employees may leave our company and subsequently compete against us 
moreover  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may be subject to claims of this type in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel and some of these claims may result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in or disputes related to hiring required personnel could hinder the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
we plan to increase our international sales  which will subject us to additional business risks 
our revenue from international sales represented of our total revenue for the twelve months ended december  we plan to expand our international sales  especially in europe and asia 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to establish relationships with international distributors  establish foreign operations  effectively manage international sales channels and develop relationships with service organizations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to establish  generate and build market demand for our products internationally 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks  including increased complexity and costs of managing international operations  multiple protectionist  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  
table of contents difficulties in collecting accounts receivables  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights  and political and economic instability 
these factors and others could harm future sales of our products to international customers  which would negatively impact our business and operating results 
to date  none of our international revenue has been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
in the future  a portion of our international revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies  including the euro  which would subject us to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
our san interconnect products are subject to us department of commerce export control restrictions 
neither our customers nor we may export those products without obtaining an export license 
these us export laws also prohibit the export of our san interconnect products to a number of countries deemed by the united states to be hostile 
these restrictions may make foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products more competitive in the global market than are our customers or we 
the us government may not approve any pending or future export license requests 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised 
the sale of our san interconnect products could be harmed by our failure or the failure of our customers to obtain the required government licenses or by the costs of compliance 
our products must comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations  and if we cannot develop products that are compatible with these evolving standards  our business will suffer 
the market for fibre channel products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as they emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
to remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these industry standards 
all components of a san must utilize the same standards in order to operate together 
our products comprise only a part of an entire san and we depend on the companies that provide other components  many of which are significantly larger than we are  to support industry standards as they evolve 
we also depend on our competitors to support these same industry standards 
the failure of these providers or our competitors to support these industry standards could negatively impact market acceptance of our products 
in addition  in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop also will be required to comply with standards established by authorities in various countries 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could materially harm our business 
our intellectual property protection may prove to be inadequate which could negatively affect our ability to compete 
we believe that our continued success depends on protecting our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
efforts to protect our intellectual property could be time consuming and expensive and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain any of our technology as trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  or at all 

table of contents third party claims of infringement of their intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we occasionally receive communications from third parties alleging patent infringement  and there always is the chance that third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
future patent infringement disputes  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available or that they could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we fail to obtain these royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to several factors  including but not limited to the following  some of which are beyond our control actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  losses of our key oems or reduction in their purchases of our products  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  announcements by us or by our competitors of significant technical innovations  contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of capital stock 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance 
we may not be able to meet our future capital requirements  limiting our ability to grow 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next twelve to eighteen months 
however  we may need  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated funding requirements 
we may engage in future acquisitions that may dilute our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities 
we may review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway  we may buy businesses  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any future purchases  we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
these purchases also may involve numerous risks  including problems assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  
table of contents diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions  risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited  if any  prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
our corporate offices and principal product development facility are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our corporate offices in bothell  washington and research facility in irvine  california are located near major earthquake faults 
we are not specifically insured for earthquakes  or other such natural disasters 
any personal injury or damage to the facilities as a result of such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and delaware law could adversely affect the performance of our stock 
our stockholder rights plan and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
the stockholder rights plan and these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which could harm our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities  the majority of which are commercial paper and government securities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
our investment portfolio  with a fair value of million as of december   is invested in commercial paper  government securities and corporate indebtedness that could experience an adverse decline in fair value should an increase in interest rates occur 
in addition  declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge against this interest rate exposure 
all of our revenue is realized in us dollars and is from customers primarily headquartered in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange risk
