item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements about our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  expect  future and intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in the section titled risk factors 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes attached to this report 
overview we produce and market the leading brands of certified organic fluid milk and a full line of branded  refrigerated organic dairy products and organic juices 
we market our products under the horizon organic and the organic cow of vermont brand names in the us  and the rachel s organic brand name in the uk in addition  we license our horizon organic brand for use on organic milk and dairy products in japan and for organic eggs in the us according to information resources  inc  a market research firm  our organic fluid milk has an approximately market share of all organic milk sold in conventional supermarket chains in the us our company was founded in boulder  colorado in we introduced our first products  organic nonfat yogurts  in  with organic fluid milk following in initially  we contracted for our supply of organic milk products with a wisconsin based cooperative 
at the time  there was a limited supply of organic fluid milk available for purchase by dairies 
in  we made a strategic decision to begin developing our own organic milk supply 
we began by building a herd of organic cows at a dairy farm in idaho  which we subsequently acquired in also in  we acquired a dairy farm in maryland in order to develop an internal organic fluid milk supply for the eastern us in  we entered into a herd management agreement for a third party to manage an additional herd of organic cows in colorado 
in  we began focusing on expanding and integrating a nationwide production  processing and distribution system 
as part of our efforts to increase our distribution  in april  we acquired the largest brand of organic dairy products in the metropolitan new york region and rebranded it under our horizon organic label 
in april  we acquired the organic cow of vermont brand name 
we continue to market our milk products under this brand in the new england region 
in  we began selling our products in europe by acquiring rachel s dairy limited  a uk company that processes  markets and distributes organic yogurts and creams 
in  we furthered our presence in the uk by acquiring meadow farms limited  the leading processor and supplier of organic fluid milk in the uk meadow farms sold primarily private label products at the time of our acquisition 
we have recently introduced organic fluid milk products under the rachel s organic brand as a result of strong uk consumer support for the rachel s organic brand 
in december  we entered into a processing and distribution agreement with dairy crest limited  the largest dairy company in the uk  that provides for them to distribute our private label and rachel s organic milk throughout the uk and to replace all of dairy crest s branded organic fluid milk with rachel s organic branded milk 
in  we made a strategic decision that  due to rising interest in organic farming  we would be able to secure sufficient supply of organic fluid milk from third parties and that it is no longer necessary for us to invest capital to expand our company owned farms 
this will allow us to focus on developing additional products  pursuing acquisitions  and marketing our brands 
as part of this focus  we have terminated our herd management agreement in colorado  and will relocate the herd to the idaho dairy 
in addition  we have had initial discussions regarding the sale of our idaho and maryland dairies  however  no definitive agreement has been negotiated or executed  and we have not reached a definitive decision to sell either the idaho dairy or the maryland dairy 
if we enter into a definitive agreement to sell any of our farm assets  those assets will be accounted for in accordance with accounting standards applicable to discontinued operations 
we will not change the accounting treatment of any of our farm assets until we reach a definitive decision to sell them 
we sell our products in the us primarily through our internal sales force that manages our external food broker  acosta  inc  the largest national food broker 
our agreement with acosta provides us with outsourced sales and category management support throughout the us through its approximately  sales representatives 
our customers are natural foods supermarkets  supermarket chains  mass merchant retailers  specialty food retailers  and food manufacturers who use our organic milk in their products 
domestic sales accounted for approximately  and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales in  and we have distribution arrangements with united natural foods  inc  a national distributor headquartered in dayville  connecticut  and hp hood  inc  a dairy processor distributor headquartered in boston  massachusetts 
each of these arrangements accounted for and  respectively  of our total sales in in addition  sales to safeway and its affiliates in the us represented of our total sales 
in the us we sell our products through our internal salesperson and  since entering into our strategic partnership agreement with dairy crest limited  through dairy crest s sales force 
in addition to increased retail distribution  our alliance with dairy crest will put our rachel s organic branded fluid milk into dairy crest s home delivery service  which reaches more than one million households in the uk in addition  sales to sainsbury s  one of the leading supermarket chains in the uk  represented of our total sales in we derive revenues primarily through product sales 
net sales include product sales  less product returns  if any  and allowances 
product sales are comprised primarily of sales of organic fluid milk  organic yogurts  organic butters  organic cheeses and organic juices 
revenue is generally recognized at the time title transfers  which is upon shipment to or pickup by a customer 
cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials  processing fees  inbound freight costs  milk pooling charges and operating income or loss before goodwill amortization from farm operations 
the costs of our farm operations include all costs associated with the milk production from our three internally owned organic dairy herds 
such cost factors primarily include organic feed  cattle depreciation  cull losses  payroll  general operating expenses and fixed asset depreciation 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles for recording the depreciation of our farm assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
cattle are depreciated using a straight line method over five years commencing with their first milking and have a capitalized cost based on purchase price plus pre production costs 
we purchase most of our fluid milk supply from various organic farmers and cooperatives throughout the us and the us in the us  we generally have contracts with our suppliers with terms of one to two years 
in the uk  terms generally range anywhere from three months to four years 
prices are set based on butterfat content and quality testing criteria and most contracts require that we purchase minimum quantities of organic farm milk 
if we cannot use the minimum amounts of milk we are required to purchase under these contracts  either as organic milk or in other organic dairy products  we sell the organic milk as conventional milk  which has a lower price point 
we record the difference between our purchase price for organic milk and the conventional milk price received by us in cost of sales 
processing fees include payments made to our dairy processors and juice processors to process raw ingredients into organic milk  dairy and juice products 
inbound freight costs include all raw material inbound shipping costs to the processors 
milk pooling charges include charges incurred by our processors as calculated by the federal milk market order system 
we estimate each month s pooling charges and adjust them to actual the following month because the pooling charge assessments are received from the system administrators one month in arrears 
gross profit includes net sales less cost of sales 
selling expenses consist of all expenses required to market and sell our products  including our direct selling  marketing and distribution costs 
general and administrative costs are comprised of all costs of operations and corporate support not specifically included in any of the items above 
depreciation expense associated with our new enterprise resource planning system and general operations accounting software is included in this line item 
intangible assets amortization includes the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of meadow farms and organic matters in  rachel s dairy in and the idaho dairy in it also includes amortization of intangible assets acquired from the juniper valley brand purchase in and the organic cow of vermont brand purchase in results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated income statements as a percent of revenues

net income 
year to year comparisons year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased by  or million  to million in from million in net sales from us operations increased  or million to million from million resulting primarily from increased sales of existing products to existing accounts and continued expansion of conventional grocery distribution channels 
changes in our us product category sales are as follows fluid milk total fluid milk sales increased  or million  to million in from million in sales of ultra pasteurized up fluid milk increased  or million  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily due to expansion of up milk to new customers throughout the year 
sales of traditional pasteurized fluid milk decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of some customers substituting up fluid milk distribution for traditional pasteurized milk distribution 
as a result of these shifts  our fluid milk product line mix shifted to traditional pasteurized fluid milk in from in other dairy total net sales of our other dairy products increased  or million  to million in from million in  driven primarily by increased sales of our cheese products and increased industrial sales 
net sales of yogurt increased  or  to million in from million in net sales of butter increased  or  to million in from million in net sales of cheese increased  or million  to million in from million in this resulted from the introduction of new cheese varieties and expansion of distribution of existing items 
net sales of industrial products  such as powder and cheeses sold for further processing into finished goods  increased  or million  to million in from million in this increase also includes the expansion of single serve branded cup yogurt into foodservice outlets 
juice net sales of our juice products increased  or million  to million in from million in principally as the result of increased distribution of our expanded flavor varieties and expanded distribution of our single serve juice products 
international net sales from international operations increased  or million  to million in from million in  primarily as a result of a full year of operations from our fluid milk acquisitions compared to seven months in net sales of rachel s organic dairy products  which in and consisted primarily of yogurt  double cream  cr me fraiche  and butter increased  or  to million in from million in we anticipate that the net sales of rachel s organic branded products will increase significantly as we introduce branded fluid milk under our brand 
previously  our fluid milk sales were either private label or branded under the horizon organic label 
we determined to shift sales from the horizon organic label to leverage the existing strength of the rachel s organic brand 
as part of our agreement with dairy crest  which we finalized in december  we will replace all of dairy crest s branded organic fluid milk with rachel s organic fluid milk in grocery stores throughout the uk dairy crest will also distribute rachel s organic branded fluid milk through its direct home delivery system  which reaches over one million households in the uk cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales is primarily the result of our increased sales 
gross profit increased  or million  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in from in primarily due to an increase in lower margin international private label sales 
our gross profit in the us decreased slightly to in from in our gross profit in the uk decreased to in from in this was primarily the result of a full year of private label organic fluid milk sales  as opposed to seven months in private label fluid milk sales are generally made at a lower gross profit than sales of our branded products 
as we introduce branded fluid milk sales in  we expect our gross profit margin to increase 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased  or million  to million in from million in driven primarily by increased trade and consumer promotion to support higher sales in the us as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses decreased to in from in primarily the result of a full year of primarily private label organic fluid milk in the uk as a result of the meadow farms acquisition  as opposed to seven months in we generally incur lower selling expenses with private label products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the december uk management restructuring 
as a percentage of net sales our general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to improved productivity 
intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets amortization expenses increased  or  to million in from million in this increase is because of a full year of amortization associated with the june acquisitions of meadow farms and organic matters in the uk  as opposed to seven months in we expect that our intangible assets amortization will be significantly decreased by approximately million annually beginning in as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other expense  net 
other expense  net increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a full year of interest expense in on the term note used to finance the june acquisitions of meadow farms and organic matters compared to seven months in  and to a lesser extent  an increase in amounts outstanding under our line of credit  which more than offset a decrease in the average interest rate in our debt facilities 
our average interest rate for the year on our libor based debt facilities decreased to for from in income tax expense 
income tax expense increased  or  to million in from  in our effective income tax rate decreased to in from in resulting from our ability to fully utilize our uk losses in as opposed to net income 
net income increased  or million  to million in from  in net income for us operations increased  or million  to million in from million in net loss for international operations decreased  or  to a net loss of million in from a net loss of million in comprehensive income 
comprehensive income increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was due to the increase in net income primarily caused by the increased leverage of sales volume  partially offset primarily by unrealized loss on translation adjustment from the british pound to the us dollar 
we translate our investment in our uk subsidiaries from pounds sterling to uk dollars at the rate in effect at the end of a period 
at december  and december   the british pound was worth approximately us and us  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased by  or million  to million in from million in net sales from us operations increased  or million  to million in from million in resulting primarily from increased sales of existing products to existing accounts and continued expansion of conventional grocery distribution channels 
also contributing to the increase in domestic net sales was the addition of a full year of sales under the organic cow of vermont brand  as compared with seven full months in changes in our us product category sales information for compared to are as follows fluid milk total fluid milk sales increased  or million  to million in from million in sales of ultra pasteurized up fluid milk increased or million  to million in  from million in  primarily due to a full year of sales in  as opposed to seven full months of sales in sales of traditional pasteurized fluid milk increased  or million  to million in from million in other dairy total net sales of other dairy products increased  or million  to million in from million in  driven primarily by increased sales of our yogurt  butter and industrial products

cost of sales increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of our increased sales 
gross profit increased  or million  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in from in due to an increase in lower margin international sales 
our gross profit in the uk decreased to in from in the lower international gross margins reflected a change in product mix to primarily private label organic fluid milk as a result of the acquisition of meadow farms 
the us gross profit margins remained unchanged from at 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased  or million  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses decreased to in from in primarily because of a decrease in international selling expenses resulting from the change in product mix to primarily private label products 
in addition  the uk acquisitions in allowed selling expenses to be leveraged over a larger revenue base  causing the percentage of net sales to drop  although the drop was partially offset by increased costs for expanded distribution 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in this decrease as a percentage of net sales was due to improved productivity in the us intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets amortization expense increased  or million  to million in from million in this increase was a result of amortization of intangible assets associated with the june acquisitions of meadow farms  as well as a full year of amortization from the april acquisitions of rachel s dairy and the organic cow of vermont 
as a percentage of net sales  our intangible assets amortization expense increased to in from in other expense  net 
other expense  net decreased to an expense of million in from income of  in the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense on the million term note used to finance the june acquisitions of meadow farms and organic matters  as well as an increase in amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased  or  to  in from million in the effective tax rate of of income before taxes remained unchanged from and was the result of foreign income tax expense provided on foreign earnings and amortization of certain goodwill not deductible for us or us tax purposes 
net income 
net income decreased  or  to  in from million in net income for us operations increased  or  to million in from million in net income for international operations decreased million to a net loss of million in  from slightly over breakeven in this decrease was a result of the increased goodwill amortization and interest expense related to the june acquisitions and the loss of tesco  a uk customer  that caused a lower overall growth rate in international operations 
comprehensive income 
comprehensive income decreased  or million  to  in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income caused by increased intangible assets amortization and interest expense related to the june acquisitions 
in addition  the value of the british pound against the us dollar dropped from year end to year end we translate our investment in our uk subsidiaries from pounds sterling to uk dollars at the rate in effect at the end of a period 
at december  and december   the british pound was worth approximately us and us  respectively

net cash provided by used in operations was million provided by operations for  million used in operations for and million provided by operations for cash provided by operations in was primarily attributable to an increase in net income as adjusted by non cash goodwill  amortization  and depreciation charges along with decreases in inventory 
cash used in operations in was primarily attributable to increases in inventories of certain products and in accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and in non cash goodwill amortization charges related to the acquisitions of meadow farms and organic matters 
cash provided by operations in was primarily attributable to net income and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in we made million of expenditures in  million in and million in expenditures in were primarily attributable to ongoing cattle purchases for herd maintenance  enterprise resource planning software  note receivable associated with the dairy crest strategic partnership and other milk production and processing equipment

in addition  ongoing cattle purchases for herd maintenance  leasehold improvements at the horizon organic farm and education center in maryland and enterprise resource planning software were large expenditures in expenditures in were attributable to the million acquisition of the organic cow of vermont brand which was financed with an million promissory note payable to the seller and the million acquisition of the rachel s organic brand  an increase in cattle inventory and investments in marketable securities

cash provided in compared to cash used in reflects the million term loan we entered into with us bank to finance the meadow farms and organic matters acquisitions 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december  and million at december  we currently have a term loan with us bank that we entered into to finance the meadow farms acquisition 
the loan is for million with a term of five years and bears an interest rate of libor plus a variable margin spread ranging from to 
at december   the interest rate was 
at december  we had an outstanding balance of million 
in addition  we have a line of credit with us bank that provides funding of up to million and bears interest at a rate of libor plus a variable margin spread ranging from to 
at december  the interest rate was 
we may borrow additional amounts under the revolving line of credit  subject to the terms of the credit agreement  until the facility s maturity date of may  as of december  we had a balance of million under this credit line in addition to letter of credit encumbrances of million 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  funds generated by operations and available credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated capital needs  but may be insufficient for cash acquisitions under our corporate development program 
if additional funds are required  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all  or on terms that would not be dilutive to our stockholders 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments summary the following table summarizes the estimated future undiscounted cash obligations associated with our long term debt  capital leases  operating leases and purchase obligations 
long term debt consists primarily of our million credit line facility and million term note facility with us bank 
these debt facilities may be declared immediately due and payable upon any event of default  as defined in the loan agreement 
events of default  as defined  include being out of compliance with the loan covenant calculations 
such covenant requirements include measures of working capital  net worth  cash flow leverage and interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at december  we were in compliance with the loan covenants 
our long term debt interest rate is primarily variable 
the table below assumes a interest rate for year and interest rate thereafter 
a full percentage point fluctuation in interest rates would result in decreasing or increasing the cash interest paid by approximately  in year one   in year two   in years three and four and nil thereafter 
capital leases are primarily for financing our computer software system implemented in the operating leases are primarily office and equipment rentals 
purchase obligations are primarily milk production contracts in the us and us us juice and management fees associated with the colorado dairy herd are also included 
payments due by period contractual obligations and commercial commitments total less than year to years to years after years in thousands long term debt including line of credit     capital lease obligations  operating leases     purchase obligations     total contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments  we have no subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions a aurora dairy corporation we entered into a dairy herd management and supply agreement on march  subsequently amended on june  and on august  with aurora dairy corporation whose majority owner is a former member of our board 
the agreement allows us to provide and maintain an organic dairy herd at aurora s facilities in platteville  colorado approximating  head milking 
we are to provide the feed for the animals and have paid for approximately  in equipment and leasehold improvements 
aurora manages the herd and pays for operating expenses outside of the feed  breeding  cattle costs and the depreciation of the leasehold improvements and equipment provided by us 
the management fees vary throughout the term of the contract but require a minimum of  per month through june  the contract runs from october through september we have not renewed the contract 
during the wind down phase from july through september we will pay a management fee of  per month 
we believe the management fees are fair and equitable for three reasons 
first  the fees charged on a production basis were comparable to a price that was indicative of an equitable return on operating costs of our own dairies 
second  the cost of the resulting milk production after freight into our dairy processor was a cost that was less expensive than other available milk supplies at the inception of the contract 
finally  we recognized that the contract resulted in a milk supply with a much shorter start up phase than any other supply at the inception of the contract 
payments made to aurora by us for management fees were   and  during  and  respectively 
additionally during these respective years  we paid aurora   and  for feed and cattle 
aurora paid us  and  during and  respectively  for the purchase of cattle 
in april aurora and we agreed that we would deliver to aurora head of cattle between april and june in exchange  aurora would deliver head of cattle to us between december and march as of december   all cattle under this agreement had been delivered to us or sold to aurora at fair market value 
b dean foods in  we entered into agreements with dean foods company  formerly suiza foods corporation  a manufacturer and distributor of fresh milk and related dairy products 
our relationship with dean foods includes five year processing and distribution agreements with three of dean food s subsidiaries model dairy  a fluid milk processor located in reno  nevada  robinson dairy  a fluid milk processor located in denver  colorado  and garelick farms  a fluid milk processor and distributor with several locations in the northeast us  which does not currently process any products for us 
the processing and distribution agreement with model dairy provides that it will be the exclusive processor for our milk products in california and nevada  with certain exceptions  and that it will distribute all skus of our organic fluid milk products which are available for sale in its territory 
the processing and distribution agreement with robinson dairy provides that we will not engage another processor within the state of colorado 
one of our directors controlled robinson dairy at the inception of the agreement 
per the agreement  we will pay minimum co packing fees for processing product through december  we also have products processed in morningstar foods  a fluid milk processor located in gustine  california and cultured specialties  a dairy processor located in fullerton and tulare  california 
both companies are subsidiaries of dean foods 
we paid dean foods and its subsidiaries approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
we monitor production costs from various processor locations 
based on historical averages and current trends we routinely compare and analyze our production costs at our existing processor plants 
from this data  we routinely discuss contract prices  efficiency and quality control topics with all of our processors 
as a result  we believe that the processing and distribution fees charged by dean foods are fair and equitable in comparison to prices charged for similar services by other fluid milk and dairy processing plants we engage 
significant accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
significant accounting policies and estimates that most impact our consolidated financial statements are those that relate to the valuation of accounts receivable in conjunction with the recognition of routine customer deductions including returns and allowances and market development support  depreciation and capitalization of costs associated with fixed assets including cattle and federal milk market order system pooling accruals 
accounts receivable we recognize trade accounts receivable in conjunction with the recognition of revenue which is generally at the time of shipment or pickup by a customer 
we traditionally experience customer payments net of customer deductions for items such as spoilage allowances or market development support before such deductions can be proven valid by us 
this deduction practice is common to our industry 
the deduction validation procedure generally lags because the customer routinely concentrates on taking the deduction and then delays in sending the proper paperwork to support the deductions 
as a result  our valuation of our accounts receivable includes accruals for estimates of such returns and allowances and doubtful accounts 
we also accrue for market development support to our customers 
upon proper receipt and validation of the deduction paperwork  the amounts accrued are used to reduce the outstanding accounts receivable balance 
capitalization and depreciation of fixed assets including cattle our property  equipment and cattle are stated at cost 
property other than land is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
equipment and cattle are depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which range from three to seven years 
major improvements are capitalized including allocation of interest incurred during the period of construction or major refurbishment 
the cost of cattle includes preproduction costs incurred from the time cattle arrive at the dairy until they enter the milking herd 
preproduction costs include feed and husbandry 
when assets are sold  retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and a gain or loss is recognized 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
we evaluate the realizability of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value 
prior to an impairment loss being recognized  an independent appraisal would be performed  if appropriate  to determine the asset s estimated fair value 
there were no impairment losses during the years ended december   and federal milk market order system pooling accruals we are included in the federal milk market order system 
as a result  our processors incur milk pooling charges as calculated by the federal milk market order system for which we are responsible 
we estimate each month s pooling charges and adjust them to actual the following month because the pooling charge assessments are received from the system administrators one month in arrears 
for additional information on our significant accounting policies  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
effect of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or fas  which goes into effect in fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies under the standard for hedge accounting 
we did not experience any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of implementing sfas in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  or sfas  which requires the use of the purchase method and eliminates the option of using the pooling of interests method of accounting for all business combinations 
the provisions in this statement apply to all business combinations initiated after june   and all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july   or later 
we do not believe that we will experience any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of implementing sfas in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which requires that all intangible assets acquired  other than those acquired in a business combination  be initially recognized and measured based on the asset s fair value 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective january  goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets will not be amortized under sfas  but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of this statement 
other identifiable intangibles will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our cash flows 
we are still reviewing the provisions of this statement regarding the impacts to earnings due to potential goodwill and intangible asset amortization reductions  however  we estimate the impact to our earnings before income taxes to be an increase of approximately million annually 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  or sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
