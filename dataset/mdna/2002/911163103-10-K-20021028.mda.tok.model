item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading national distributor of natural and organic foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the acquisition of or merger with natural products distributors  the expansion of existing distribution centers and the continued growth of the natural products industry in general 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
our distribution operations are divided into four principal units united natural foods in the eastern region  mountain people s warehouse  inc and rainbow natural foods in the western region  blooming prairie since october  and albert s in various markets in the united states 
through our subsidiary  the natural retail group  we also own and operate natural products retail stores located primarily in florida 
we believe our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business  enabling us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
in addition  our hershey subsidiary is a business that specializes in the international trading  roasting and packaging of nuts  seeds  dried fruits and snack items 
we are continually integrating certain operating functions in order to improve operating efficiencies  including i expanding marketing and customer service programs across the four regions  ii expanding national purchasing opportunities  iii consolidating systems applications among physical locations and regions  iv integrating administrative and accounting functions  and v reducing geographic overlap between regions 
in addition  our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
we have made considerable capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the expansion of our facilities located in auburn  california  new oxford  pennsylvania and los angeles  california 
in january we began distribution from our new  square foot atlanta  georgia facility 
we are currently utilizing approximately  square feet and leasing out the remaining  square feet 
the efficiencies created by consolidating our two atlanta  georgia  facilities into one have lowered our expenses relative to sales 
in march we began distribution to our southern california  southern nevada and arizona customers from our new  square foot distribution center in fontana  california 
the proximity of our new facility to these customers enables us to provide improved service  while reducing transportation expenses 
in may we relocated our hershey subsidiary from rahway  new jersey to edison  new jersey in order to expand our shipping and receiving capacity and to consolidate inventories currently being stored in outside warehouses 
at fiscal year end the increased capacity of our distribution centers was approximately  square feet greater than it was five years ago 
we recently began expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution facility from its existing  square feet to  square feet 
this will enable us to service existing and new customers  provide more product diversity  and enable us to better balance products among our distribution centers in our eastern region 
while operating margins may be affected in periods in which these expenses are incurred  over the long term  we expect to benefit from the increased absorption of our expenses over a larger sales base 
in addition  we continue to increase our leading market share of the growing natural products industry by expanding our customer base  increasing our share of existing customers business and continuing to expand and further penetrate new distribution territories  particularly in the midwest and texas markets 
to this end  on october  we acquired substantially all the assets of blooming prairie  the largest volume distributor of natural foods and products in the midwest region of the united states 
the acquisition of blooming prairie s iowa city  iowa and mounds view  minnesota distribution facilities has provided us with an immediate physical base and growth platform with which to broaden our presence in the fast growing midwest market 
on october   we signed an agreement to purchase northeast cooperatives  a distributor of natural foods and products in the eastern united states 
northeast cooperatives  headquartered in brattleboro  vermont  and in business since  had approximately million in sales for the latest twelve months 
consummation of the transaction is contingent upon customary closing conditions  approval by the members of northeast cooperatives and approval from northeast cooperatives lenders 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amount paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on outstanding indebtedness  interest income  and the change in fair value of financial instruments and miscellaneous income and expenses 
our operating margin increased from in fiscal to for the fiscal year ended july  excluding special items 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of accounts receivable valuation and the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable and notes receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  and million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of july  and  respectively 
our notes receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  and million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of july  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and covenants not to compete 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with purchase business combinations 
covenants not to compete are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized using the straight line method over the lives of the respective agreements  generally five years 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we adopted sfas no 
on august  we completed our transition goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended january  and there were no indicators of goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units 
we tested each of our reporting units for an indicator of goodwill impairment by comparing the net present value of projected cash flows to the carrying value of the reporting unit as of july  we used discount rates determined by our management to be commensurate with the level of risk in our current business model and projected cash flows for to years 
we completed a second goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended july  and there were no indicators of goodwill impairment for any of our reporting divisions 
there can be no assurance that at our next annual review a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
we ceased to amortize goodwill when we adopted sfas no 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million as of july  we recorded additional goodwill of million during the year ended july  as a result of our acquisition of boulder fruit express 
we had recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization for the year ended july  we expect to record additional goodwill and intangible assets  in the first quarter of fiscal  relating to our blooming prairie acquisition  of approximately million 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  us gaap basis excluding special items net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses merger  restructuring and asset impairment expenses amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense change in value of financial instruments other  net total other expense income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  the increase was primarily due to growth in the supernatural and mass market distribution channels of approximately and  respectively 
also included in net sales for fiscal were sales for boulder fruit express  an organic produce and perishables distributor we acquired in november  and sales for a florida retail store we opened in october sales growth excluding the acquisition and the new store sales would have been 
sales to our two largest customers  whole foods market  inc and wild oats  inc 
represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales for the year ended july  whole foods market  inc represented approximately and wild oats  inc represented approximately of net sales for the year ended july  whole foods market  inc agreed to extend our current distribution arrangement through august  in addition  whole foods market  inc is a member of blooming prairie cooperative warehouse  which we recently acquired  and we expect whole foods market  inc to represent approximately of our total sales in fiscal on june   we announced that our contract as primary distributor to wild oats  inc would not be renewed past its expiration date of august  however  we continue to distribute to wild oats  inc and expect revenue of approximately million to million in fiscal gross profit 
our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the years ended july  and july  we expect our gross margin as a percentage of sales to be in the range of to for the fiscal year as our business with wild oats  inc  a low gross margin customer  declines because we will be a secondary  rather than a primary  distributor to them 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special charges  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  special items are discussed in the following paragraph 
the lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were due primarily to increased efficiencies in our transportation departments as a result of more efficient routing and successfully leveraging our fixed expenses against a higher sales base 
we also experienced improved labor productivity due primarily to a more favorable labor market nationwide and a higher retention rate of experienced warehouse and transportation employees 
we experienced significant increases in workers compensation and commercial automobile insurance premiums 
the insurance premium market is somewhat volatile  and whether there is improvement or deterioration in future quarters is largely dependent on our ability to control our automobile and workers compensation losses  which are retained risks 
we have reduced our operating expenses  excluding special charges  to of sales by continuing to realize operating efficiencies and expanding our sales base 
we expect operating expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the mid range for the fiscal year due to absorption of fixed costs over a lower sales base as our wild oats  inc business is reduced 
we expect to incur additional special charges as we increase our warehouse capacity 
special items 
special items for the year ended july  included a non cash charge related to the change in fair value of financial instruments interest rate swaps and related option agreements  relocation  asset impairment and redundant rent expense related to moving our atlanta  georgia distribution facility  incremental costs such as labor  utilities and rent related to the startup of our southern california distribution facility and labor  utilities  rent and severance related to relocating hershey import 
special items for the year ended july  consisted of a non cash charge related to the change in financial instruments  costs related to the expansion of our new oxford  pennsylvania distribution facility and asset impairment charges  primarily goodwill  associated with closing an unprofitable retail store 
operating expenses  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses  including special items  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  operating income 
operating income  excluding the special items  increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating income  excluding special items  increased to for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  operating income  including special items  increased million to million or of sales for the year ended july  from million or of sales for the year ended july  other income expense 
other expense  excluding the change in fair value of financial instruments  increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to higher interest expense caused by a higher borrowing base  partially offset by lower interest rates 
other expense  including the change in fair value of financial instruments  increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to the decrease in fair value on our interest rate swap agreements and related option agreements resulting from unfavorable changes in yield curves used to determine the change in fair value 
we will continue to recognize either income or expense quarterly for the duration of the swap agreement until either october or for the swap agreement entered into in october  and either august or for the swap agreement entered into in august  depending on whether the agreements are extended by the counter party 
the recognition of income or expense in any given quarter  and the magnitude of that item  is dependent on interest rates and the remaining term of the contracts 
upon expiration of any such contract  the cumulative earnings impact from the changes in fair value of the instruments will be zero 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for the years ended july  and the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income  excluding special items  increased million to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income  including special items  increased million to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  we expect earnings per diluted share  excluding any special items  in the range of for all of fiscal and in the range for the quarter ended october  the following table details the amounts and effects of the special items discussed on the preceding page year ended july  pretax per diluted in thousands  except per share data income net of tax share income  excluding special items   less special items change in value of financial instruments   relocation and startup costs included in operating expenses   asset impairment charges us gaap income  including special items   year ended july  pretax per diluted in thousands  except per share data income net of tax share income  excluding special items   less special items change in value of financial instruments  expansion costs operating expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges us gaap income  including special items   year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to increased sales throughout all divisions and distribution channels including super naturals  independents and mass market 
we also experienced market share gains during fiscal year by selling to a greater number of new customers 
sales to our two largest customers  whole foods market  inc and wild oats  inc 
represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales for the year ended july  whole foods market  inc represented approximately and wild oats  inc represented approximately  of net sales for the year ended july  gross profit 
gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  the increase in gross profit resulted primarily from our recovery in our eastern region as customer returns and allowances  inventory shrink  pricing errors and inbound transportation costs decreased significantly 
this increase was partially offset by inventory loss at an outside storage location  as well as reduced margins in our albert s division 
additionally  the gain in our gross profit was further offset by a change in our channel mix as the percentage of our sales to super naturals  which are at lower gross margins  increased 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses  excluding special charges  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special charges  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to increased labor productivity in our distribution centers  increased efficiencies in our transportation departments as a result of better routing and successfully leveraging our fixed expenses against a higher sales base 
the improved labor productivity was due primarily to a more favorable labor market nationwide and higher retention rate of experienced warehouse employees 
the improved transportation routing resulted in fewer miles traveled by our fleet  and corresponding reductions in expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended july  included special charges of million related to the expansion of our new oxford  pennsylvania distribution facility  and million of asset impairment charges  primarily goodwill  associated with the closing of an unprofitable retail store 
our operating expenses for the year ended july  were impacted by several special charges 
these charges included approximately million of executive severance costs and the write off of current assets in the eastern region and chicago and approximately million of restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the write off of certain eastern region fixed assets and the closing of our chicago facility

other income expense 
the million increase in other expense for the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was attributable to slightly higher debt levels and non cash expense related to an interest rate swap that were partially offset by lower interest rates 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires recognition in the financial statements of the change in fair value during the year of certain interest rate protection contracts and other derivatives 
we recorded fas expense of million on our interest rate swap agreement resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the year 
we will continue to recognize this income or expense for the duration of the swap contract until either october or  depending on whether the contract is extended 
we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement effective august  with a termination date of either august or august whether we recognize income or expense in any given quarter  and the magnitude of that item  is dependent on interest rates and the remaining term of the contract

in september  we entered into an agreement to increase our secured revolving credit facility to million from million at an interest rate of libor plus  maturing on june  this additional access to capital will provide for working capital requirements in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million with remaining availability of million

impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass along inflation related increases 
consequently  inflation has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations or profitability 
seasonality generally  we do not experience any material seasonality

we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements  all of which are expressly qualified by the statement in this section 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
successful integration of mergers is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
integration requires  among other things the optimization of delivery routes  coordination of administrative  distribution and finance functions  the integration of management information systems and personnel and maintaining customer base 
the integration process has and could divert the attention of management and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining companies has and could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
we may also lose key employees of the acquired company 
there can be no assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of mergers 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
there can be no assurance that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than us  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than united natural foods to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
we depend heavily on our principal customer our current distribution arrangement with our top customer  whole foods market  inc  is effective through august  on june   we announced that our contract as primary distributor to wild oats  inc  would not be renewed past its expiration date of august  however  we continue to distribute to wild oats  inc and expect revenue of approximately million to million from such distribution in fiscal whole foods market  inc and wild oats  inc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales during the fiscal year ended july  on october  we acquired substantially all of the assets of blooming prairie  the largest volume distributor of natural foods and products in the midwest region of the united states 
whole foods market  inc is a member of blooming prairie and we expect whole foods market  inc to represent approximately of our total sales in fiscal as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from whole foods market  inc could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
no assurance can be given that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of super natural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts 
our operations are sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  difficulties with inventory control  competitive pricing pressures  and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of michael s 
funk  chief executive officer  steven townsend  president  todd weintraub  chief financial officer  kevin t 
michel  president of our western region  dan atwood  senior vice president and secretary  rick antonelli  eastern region president and other key management employees 
loss of the services of any officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to changes in our operating expenses  management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages  general economic conditions  changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration regulate our trucking operations 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of july   approximately employees  representing approximately of our approximately  employees  were union members 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
on october  we acquired substantially all the assets of blooming prairie  adding approximately employees 
approximately of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
this agreement expires in june of our financial condition could be diminished based on access to capital and the cost of that capital in september we entered into an agreement to increase our secured revolving credit facility to million from million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on june  the proceeds were used to refinance our existing credit facility  several fixed term mortgage loans  and an equipment loan 
this additional access to capital will provide for working capital requirements in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million with remaining availability of million 
as of october   the date of acquisition of blooming prairie  our borrowing base was million with an availability of million and included availability from the blooming prairie acquisition of approximately million 
in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital
