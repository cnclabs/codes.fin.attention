item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of health improvement services in the united states 
as the largest pbm based on number of lives covered  we currently serve more than million health plan members and manage approximately billion in prescription drug spending on an annualized basis on behalf of our health plan sponsors 
in addition  we offer a wide range of other health improvement products and services  such as prescription discount cards for the uninsured and under insured  web based programs  disease management  clinical trials and outcomes studies 
our mission is to improve the quality of care delivered to health plan members while helping health plan sponsors reduce overall costs 
over the past few years  the pbm industry has undergone significant consolidation 
we believe such consolidation has principally been driven by the significant benefits of size and scale  including cost saving opportunities to leverage a fixed cost infrastructure over greater prescription claim volume  resulting in greater pricing flexibility  and increased negotiating leverage with pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacies  resulting in greater ability to obtain lower drug costs for health plan sponsors 
we believe pbms that effectively capture these benefits will be positioned to strengthen their relationships with plan members  physicians and health plan sponsors and improve their competitive position 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we purchased pcs on october  and have included this business in our consolidated results of operations since that time 
we made changes in our revenue recognition presentation to conform the different policies used by advance paradigm and pcs 
these changes are reflected in all periods presented 
these changes are as follows the historical pcs amounts have been reclassified to reflect the change in presentation of data services revenues 
in cases in which we have assumed an independent obligation to pay our network pharmacy providers and act as a principal in the transaction  we include payments from our plan sponsors for these benefits as revenues and payments to our pharmacy providers as cost of revenues ie gross reporting 
historically  pcs recorded only claims processing fees as revenues ie net reporting 
the change results in higher revenues and an equal increase in cost of revenues 
this change had no effect on gross profit or operating income 
in addition  the historical financial statements of advancepcs have been revised to reflect a change in recognition of clinical and other service revenues 
we receive funds from pharmaceutical manufacturers for formulary rebate programs that we administer on behalf of our health plan sponsors 
we record revenues in the amount of the administration fees we charge for our services ie net reporting and include the cost of such services in cost of revenues 
previously  we recognized the entire amount of the rebate  including our administration fee  in revenues and the portion of the rebate paid to our client in cost of revenues ie gross reporting 
this revision resulted in lower revenues and an equal decrease in cost of revenues 
this change had no effect on gross profit or operating income 
revenues from the dispensing of pharmaceuticals from our mail service pharmacy are recognized when each prescription is shipped 
revenues from sales of prescription drugs by pharmacies in our nationwide network and claims processing fees are recognized when the claims are adjudicated 
at the point of sale  the pharmacy claims are adjudicated using our on line claims processing system 
when we independently contract to pay our network pharmacy providers  we assume credit risk and act as a principal in the transaction  therefore  we include payments from plan sponsors for these benefits as revenues and payments to its pharmacy providers as cost of revenues ie gross reporting in accordance with eitf reporting gross revenue as a principle vs net as an agent 
if we are only administering plan sponsors network pharmacy contracts  the company records the claims processing fees as revenue ie net reporting 
if we had reported our data services revenues using net reporting  revenues and cost of revenues would have decreased by billion  billion and billion  respectively  for the fiscal years ended march   and clinical services fees received from the plan sponsors or pharmaceutical manufacturers are recognized in revenues as earned in accordance with the contractual agreements 
clinical services revenue includes service fees for negotiating rebates 
table of contents with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its health plan sponsor customers 
the rebate due from the manufacturer is determined based on a complex formula including such factors as volume and quarterly drug utilization 
we estimate the most recent quarter s rebate receivables from the manufacturers and rebate payable to plan sponsors and its fees based on the terms of its contracts and claims for the quarter 
following the end of the quarter  we invoice the drug manufacturer 
we revise our estimates based upon the invoiced amounts 
rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of plan sponsors are excluded from revenues 
clinical services revenues from certain disease management and health benefit management products are reimbursed at predetermined contractual rates based on the delivery or completion of the services 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes product costs  pharmacy claims payments made to our retail network pharmacies and other direct costs associated with the provision of customer services and the sale and or dispensing of prescriptions including our call center operations 
rebate amounts paid to plan sponsors  collected from pharmaceutical manufacturers  are excluded from cost of revenues 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses reflect the costs of operations dedicated to generating new sales and maintaining existing client relationships 
these expenses also include costs relating to certain corporate functions including executive oversight  accounting  treasury  tax  legal  public affairs  human resources  procurement and other services 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we have made significant estimates of the purchase price  fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions  clinical service revenues and costs  reserves for uncollectable accounts and contract losses and the value of our various investments 
we continually evaluate the appropriateness of the amounts recorded and revise these estimates regularly 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounts receivable accounts receivable balances represent trade receivables generated from health benefit management and related services 
to reduce the potential for credit risk  the company performs ongoing evaluations of its customer s financial condition but does not generally require significant collateral 
as of march  and  unbilled receivables were million and million  respectively 
unbilled receivables to plan sponsors are typically billed within days and unbilled receivables to manufacturers are typically billed within days  based on the respective contractual billing schedule 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have adopted statement of accounting financial standards sfas effective april  under sfas goodwill is no longer amortized 
in addition  certain identified intangibles with indefinite lives are also not amortized  but are subject to periodic impairment testing 
amortization expense for the fiscal year ended march  was million  which represented the amortization relating to the identified intangible assets with finite lives 
over the next five years  intangible amortization expense relating to these identified intangibles will be as follows in thousands years ending march  total under sfas assembled workforce is not a recognized intangible asset and accordingly has been reclassified as goodwill 
in addition  the trade name is deemed to have an indefinite life as it is expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
accordingly  the trade name is no longer amortized 
the effect of the adoption of sfas is summarized in the following table

the acquisition of the remaining equity interest was completed with cash of million  making chi a wholly owned subsidiary 
under the terms of the acquisition we may pay additional cash upon the achievement by chi of certain account growth targets 
prior to the complete acquisition of chi  we had accounted for our interest in chi on the cost basis 
in accordance with apb opinion all prior period financial statements have been restated to account for chi as though we had accounted for our investment on the equity method 
effective august  we completed the acquisition of of the equity of dresing lierman  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  theracom inc collectively  theracom  a specialty pharmacy and distribution company located in bethesda  maryland 
the aggregate purchase price paid was million shares of our class a common stock 
an additional  shares of class a common stock were placed in escrow  subject to release upon achievement of future financial performance 
in addition  we paid million to eliminate theracom s outstanding indebtedness 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the excess of the purchase price paid over the net identifiable assets and liabilities of theracom  million  was recorded as goodwill 
we also recognized million in intangible 
table of contents customer contracts 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to the net identifiable assets and goodwill is preliminary and subject to revision following the results of an appraisal and further identification of intangible assets 
on october  we completed the acquisition of pcs for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  of which we paid rite aid  the seller  million in cash and issued to rite aid million in senior subordinated notes and million in our convertible preferred stock 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed with the proceeds of an million senior secured credit facility and million in equity financing committed by jll 
in connection with the equity financing  we issued to jll  shares of series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  six shares of series b convertible preferred stock and million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
on december   the six shares of series b convertible preferred stock and the million shares of class a common stock automatically converted into million shares of class b common stock 
in connection with the senior subordinated notes  we issued to rite aid warrants to purchase million shares of class a common stock 
the senior subordinated notes were fully redeemed on march  the warrants terminated upon repayment of the senior subordinated notes 
the acquisition of pcs was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the excess of the purchase price paid over the net identifiable assets and liabilities of pcs was recorded as goodwill 
effective july   we completed a merger with ffi 
we issued seven million shares of our class a common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of ffi 
the merger constituted a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the historical financial results have been restated in accordance with apb to reflect the merger as though ffi had always been a part of advancepcs 
sources of revenue we group the revenues from all of our health improvement service offerings into three categories data  mail and clinical services 
data services through our data services operations we process prescription claims on behalf of our health plan sponsor customers 
when a member of one of our health plan sponsors presents a prescription or health plan identification card to a retail pharmacist in our network  the pharmacist accesses our online system to receive information regarding eligibility  patient history  health plan formulary listings and negotiated price 
the member generally pays a co pay to the retail pharmacy and the pharmacist fills the prescription 
on behalf of our health plan sponsors  during each billing cycle  our systems electronically aggregate pharmacy benefit claims  which include prescription costs plus our claims processing fees 
once we receive payments from health plan sponsors  we remit the amounts owed by those health plan sponsors to the retail pharmacies and retain the claims processing fees 
we have established a nationwide network of over  retail pharmacies  each of which pay an access fee to be included in our network 
our contracts with most of our health plan sponsors provide for member access to our retail pharmacy network 
under these contracts  we have an independent obligation to pay network retail pharmacies for the drugs dispensed  meaning we have assumed this risk 
we are a principal in the transaction  therefore  we record the aggregate pharmacy benefit claim payments from our health plan sponsors as revenues and include prescription costs to be paid to retail pharmacies in cost of revenues 
some of our other customers have established their own pharmacy networks 
under contracts with these customers  we are not at risk for retail pharmacy payment obligations 
thus  we record only our claims processing fees as revenues and do not include prescription costs in revenues or cost of revenues 
as a result  customers that use our network will generate higher revenues than customers that use their own networks 
similarly  while a customer who uses our network may contribute the same gross profit in terms of dollars as a customer that uses its own network  gross profit as a percentage of revenue will be significantly lower for the customer using our network because of the higher level of revenue we recognize 
mail services we derive mail services revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals to members of our customers health plans 
these revenues include the cost of the pharmaceuticals plus a dispensing fee 
our cost of revenues includes product costs and other direct costs associated with the dispensing of prescription drugs 

table of contents clinical and other services we have historically derived our clinical revenues primarily from formulary management and administration of rebate and volume discount programs of pharmaceutical manufacturers relating to our pbm and consumer card operations 
we record revenues in the amount of the fees we charge for our services and include the cost of such services in cost of revenues 
some of these revenues are based on estimates of rebates generated for our clients that are subject to final settlement with the manufacturer 
in addition  we generate clinical revenues on a fee for service basis on the sale of our comprehensive health improvement products and services  including disease management  clinical trials and outcomes studies

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to all entities and legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  constructions  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and are subsequently allocated to expense over the asset s useful life 
this statement is effective for the financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined the impact that sfas will have on its financial position or results of operations 
in august the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however  this statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
this statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for segments of a business to be disposed of 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

as a result  changes in pharmaceutical prices due to inflation have not adversely affected us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we have entered into interest rate protection agreements interest rate swaps see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements that have fixed the libor rate as of november  at for million of our variable rate debt under our credit facility 
the notional amount dropped to million in october and drops to million in october we use the interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk on future interest payments 
in addition the company has million of senior notes outstanding 
as a result  virtually all of our debt is effectively fixed rate debt as of march  due to these measures a change in interest rates would have no material effect on our statement of operations but could impact the fair value of debt outstanding relative to current market rates 
a sensitivity analysis is used to determine the impact interest rate changes will have on the fair value of the interest rate swap  measuring the change in the net present value arising from the change in the interest rate 
the fair value of the swap is then determined by calculating the present value of all cash flows expected to arise thereunder  with future interest rate levels implied from prevailing mid market swap rates 
anticipated cash flows are then discounted on the assumption of a continuously compounded zero coupon yield curve
