overview we provide application software for service organizations in large enterprises 
these service organizations include the information technology  consulting  and research and development groups as well as other 
table of contents organizations rendering services for the enterprise 
our software enables customers to reduce costs and increase productivity in their service organizations and gain visibility and control over strategic initiatives 
our software achieves these results by allowing users to collaborate  allocate resources  manage initiatives  account for activities and capture and reuse knowledge using one integrated system 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets and restructuring reserves for vacated leased facilities 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue principally from licenses of our products  maintenance and support  and delivery of implementation services 
we offer our products primarily through our direct sales force 
in certain international markets  we also offer our products indirectly through channel partners 
revenue from license fees is recognized in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  and which permits revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred and no significant obligations from us with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sales to channel partners are generally recognized upon sell through to the end user customer 
we define each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a license agreement with us 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon the earlier of shipment of the product  notification of receipt of the product or notification by the customer of acceptance 
if undelivered products or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we negotiate the fees for our products at the outset of an arrangement 
in these arrangements  the majority of the licenses are perpetual and nonrefundable 
the fees are generally due within six months or less 
we consider fees relating to arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is evaluated on a customer by customer basis 
a customer s purchase order or waiver for purchase order is generally required with each arrangement 
new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position eg cash position and credit rating and their ability to pay  and existing customers are subject to a review of payment histories 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual value method 
the determination of the fair value of maintenance and support and consulting services is based on the objective evidence of the fair value of each element that is specific to us 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the 
table of contents vsoe for each element is established when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance and support services and consulting services components of our perpetual license arrangements 
vsoe for maintenance and support is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for this element 
we sell our consulting services separately and have established vsoe on this basis 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop maintenance and support revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service period  which is typically one year 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and do not require significant modifications 
the customer may implement using their own resources or obtain the services of other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
therefore  our consulting services are not considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement 
the revenue allocable to the consulting services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
in years prior to fiscal  license revenue includes product licenses to companies from which we have purchased products and services under separate arrangements executed within a short period of time reciprocal arrangements 
products and services purchased in reciprocal arrangements include software licensed for our internal use  software licensed for resale or incorporation into our products  and development or implementation services 
for reciprocal arrangements  we consider accounting principles board  or apb  no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 nonmonetary transactions magnitude of boot and exceptions to the use of fair value  interpretation of accounting principles board no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to determine whether the arrangement is a monetary or nonmonetary transaction 
transactions involving the exchange of boot representing or greater of the fair value of the reciprocal arrangement are considered monetary transactions within the context of apb no 
and eitf issue no 
monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions that represent the culmination of an earnings process are recorded at the fair value of the products delivered or products or services received  whichever is more readily determinable  providing these fair values are determinable within reasonable limits 
in determining these fair values  we consider the recent history of cash sales of the same products or services in similar sized transactions 
for nonmonetary reciprocal arrangements that do not represent the culmination of the earnings process  the exchange is recorded based on the carrying value of the products delivered  generally zero 
in fiscal  we recognized no revenue under reciprocal arrangements 
revenue recognized under reciprocal arrangements was million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  of which approximately  and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  involved nonmonetary exchanges 
we have never engaged in a transaction in which we provided product licenses or services to a customer in exchange for an equity interest 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue generally results from the following deferred maintenance and support  consulting services not yet rendered for which we have been paid  amounts billed to customers with extended payment terms  which amounts are not yet due  and for transactions in which one of the four revenue recognition criteria has not been met 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of january  and  respectively 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the amount of the aged accounts receivable  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for all invoices by 
table of contents applying a percentage to each aging category 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances such as our customers financial positions may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
impairment assessment we evaluate our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future discounted or undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of fair value of an asset considers prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques to the extent available in the circumstances  such as the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in fiscal  we determined that our goodwill and certain other identifiable intangibles acquired from our acquisitions and other assets were impaired  resulting in a charge of million in asset impairment and other 
we regularly perform an impairment assessment of a  strategic equity investment we made in a private company 
in performing an impairment assessment  we consider the business current solvency  future access to capital and recent equity transactions 
based on an analysis of these factors  we determined that there was no impairment of such investment as of january  due to the rapid changes occurring in the business sector in which our strategic investment operates and the inherent risk associated with investments in early stage technology companies  it is possible that we may have to record an impairment charges related to this investment in the future 
we regularly perform an impairment assessment of our prepaid royalties for the right to third party licensed technology 
in performing an impairment assessment  we consider the future inclusion of third party technology in our products and anticipated usage under the applicable contract 
based on an analysis of these factors  we recorded million in impairment of licensed technology in fiscal as of january   we had  in prepaid royalties 
restructuring reserves for vacated leased facilities we have recorded significant restructuring charges in connection with vacating of certain leased facilities pursuant to our restructuring program 
costs associated with vacated leased facilities include remaining lease liabilities  brokerage fees and impairment of leasehold improvements  offset by estimated sublease income 
estimated sublease income is determined by taking into consideration the type and condition of the subject property  the local commercial real estate market and expectations about time to obtain a sublessee provided by commercial real estate brokerages 
we regularly review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for vacated leases could vary by material amounts 
future minimum lease payments and brokerage fees  net of estimated sublease income relating to facilities that we vacated pursuant to the restructuring program amount to million  million  million  and  for the years ended january      and  respectively  and million thereafter 
repricing of stock options on november   our board of directors  acting pursuant to existing terms of our stock options plans  approved a repricing of approximately million outstanding stock options with exercise prices above 
table of contents 
the exercise prices of all such stock options were repriced to  which was the fair market value of our stock on november  the options were repriced with no changes to the vesting schedule 
options held by our chief executive officer  executive vice president  strategy and planning  board of directors and non employees were not repriced 
we accounted for the repriced options using variable accounting whereby stock based compensation for the options were remeasured on january  and will be continuously remeasured quarterly and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for each reporting period 
we recorded approximately million in deferred stock based compensation and amortized million in stock based compensation in the year ended january  relating to these repriced stock options 
pro forma financial results we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the quarterly financial results release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of impairment charges  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring and exit costs  stock based compensation and merger related expenses 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases  compare gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results  and read the associated reconciliation

asset impairment and other 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions due to a change in our product plan related to certain acquired technologies 
this assessment was based on the expected future cash flows from goodwill and intangible assets over their remaining useful lives 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded million in asset impairment charges 
this amount included million to write down the net book value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets from our acquisitions of legal anywhere  bsource  monkeys and alyanza to zero except for the carrying value of legal anywhere s goodwill and customer lists which was reduced to their estimated fair value of million

in march  we entered into a facility lease agreement for our worldwide headquarters 
the lease term commenced upon possession of the facility in august and has a term of years 
lease payments will be made on an escalating basis and the total future minimum lease payments amount to approximately million over the lease term 
as part of this agreement  we are required to hold a letter of credit drawable by the lessor totaling approximately million  secured by an equal amount of cash deposits 
we also have other facilities and equipment leases under various noncancellable operating leases with various expiration dates through that required letters of credit drawable by lessor for million 
in october  we entered into two loan agreements with a financial institution secured generally by certain of our tangible and intangible assets and providing revolving lines of credit up to million  of which a million line of credit is secured by qualifying accounts receivables

these amounts were recorded in accrued liabilities and long term restructuring accrual as of january  we believe that cash from operations and existing cash will be sufficient to meet our current expectations for working capital and expense requirements for at least the next twelve months based on  among other things  our current revenue and expense projections 
however  in the long term  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund our business  expand our sales activities  develop new or enhance existing products  respond to competitive pressures and satisfy new obligations that may arise 
we may also need to raise funds in the future to meet our working capital needs 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
while we significantly reduced our cash usage over the course of fiscal  capital is 
table of contents critical to our business  and our inability to raise capital in the event of ongoing losses would have a significant adverse effect on our business 
if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the then existing holders of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and requires the use of the purchase method of accounting  includes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and mandates that all goodwill created after june  will not be amortized 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at which time all goodwill amortization will be discontinued  and instead goodwill must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis using a fair value method 
in addition  separately identified and recognized intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed before july  that do not meet the new criteria for separate recognition of intangible assets will be reclassified as goodwill at the effective date of sfas no 
those intangible assets not reclassified to goodwill must be reassessed and amortized over revised useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
because we have not acquired a company since june   and we have no goodwill or other intangible assets  we anticipate no effect in adopting sfas no 
and no 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of retirement obligations be recognized as a liability when they are incurred and that the associated retirement costs be capitalized as a long term asset and expensed over its useful life 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for impairment or disposal by sale of long lived assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operation 
in november  the fasb issued topic d income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which will require companies to report reimbursements of out of pocket expenses as revenues and the corresponding expenses incurred as costs of revenues within the income statement 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  that the adoption of topic d will have on our financial position and results of operation which will be effective for our year ended january  we will adopt this pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  the asia pacific region 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenue were made in us dollars 
therefore  a strengthening of the dollar may make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not expect any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to movements in any specific foreign currency as our operating expenses in each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses of our european and asia pacific subsidiaries 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 

table of contents our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits  certificates of deposits and money market accounts that mature in three months or less 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents and the short term features and fixed interest rate of our indebtedness  we believe that there is no material market or interest rate risk exposure
