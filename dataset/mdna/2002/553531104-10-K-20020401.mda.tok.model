see the section below entitled impact of recently issued accounting standards 
marc analysis research corporation on june   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of marc  a software developer and supplier whose products include marc  a non linear finite element analysis program for engineering structural analysis  mentat  a graphical user interface for marc  and marc autoforge  a simulation program for the bulk forging industry 
the aggregate fair value of the consideration paid to shareholders and holders of options of marc resulted in a purchase price valued at approximately  including approximately  in cash and a package of securities to the marc shareholders  including  principal amount of subordinated notes due in years  approximately  principal amount of subordinated notes due in two years   principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures due august   and five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share

accordingly  it was written off at the time of the acquisition 
the remaining purchase price was allocated as follows  to net tangible assets   to identified intangible assets including  of developed technology   to customer list   for trade name recognition  and  of assembled work force  and  to goodwill 
goodwill and identified intangibles are being amortized over years 
universal analytics inc on june   we acquired uai for approximately  in cash 
uai is a developer and distributor of finite element analysis software and engineering services for the engineering community and to major manufacturers worldwide 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results of uai are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired was approximately  goodwill and identified intangibles are being amortized over ten years

we financed a portion of the purchase price through an  term loan 
csar is a developer and distributor of finite element analysis software and services for the engineering community and to major manufacturers worldwide 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results of csar have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired was approximately  goodwill and identified intangibles are being amortized over five years 
asset impairment and restructuring we have consistently followed the policy of capitalizing software development costs related to product development in accordance with the guidelines established under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project 
these capitalized software development costs are subject to an ongoing quarterly assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in hardware and software technologies 
amortization of software development costs begins when the product is available for general release 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis on either the straight line method over periods not exceeding three years or the sales ratio method that is based on expected unit sales and the estimated life of the product 
unamortized software development costs determined to be in excess of net realizable value of the product are expensed immediately 
accordingly  during the second quarter of  we recognized non cash pre tax charges of  related to the write off of the net book value of certain previously capitalized software development costs and to provide for the remaining payments due 
these costs were deemed impaired because they represented duplicate technologies from those acquired in the marc acquisition 
in the third quarter of  we recorded total restructuring charges of  of this amount  we recorded  of additional acquisition costs related to the integration of aes 
the costs relating to the consolidation of aes office facilities were included in the purchase price allocation  resulting in additional goodwill 
the remaining  was recorded as a charge to income in these additional restructuring charges related to the impairment of an asset caused by the terms of the aes acquisition and the consolidation of existing office facilities 
on february   we announced a new organizational structure following a re evaluation of our business strategy 
the new structure is designed to better serve the existing customer base and at the same time address expanding growth opportunities 
the reorganization plan provided for a reduction in our worldwide workforce of approximately positions and the consolidation of field offices 
these changes resulted in pre tax charges of  in the first two quarters of the charges consist of severance costs of  costs related to facility consolidations of  and other charges of  following is the activity in the restructuring reserve years ended december  balance at beginning of period    charges to expense   reversal of restructuring charges  acquisition costs capitalized   amounts paid or realized    balance at end of period    results of operations the following table sets forth items included in the consolidated statements of income data as percentages of total revenue

software revenue software revenue was  for compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in paid up licenses 
software revenue consists of licensing fees  which are fees charged for the right to use our software or a third parties software 
software is sold through monthly  annual or longer lease arrangements and through paid up license arrangements  whereby the customer purchases a long term license for the use of the software 
services revenue services revenue was  for compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or

the following table shows revenue by geographic region and the related growth rates between and years ended december  revenue growth of total revenue revenue the americas    europe    asia pacific    total revenue    the increase in revenue for the americas was primarily due to the acquisition of aes in july the operations of aes were entirely in the united states 
the remaining increase in the americas revenue as well as the increase for the other geographic regions was due primarily to increases in paid up software licenses and software support and consulting services 
the americas reported increases of  in software revenue and increases of  in services revenue  which included an increase of  from consulting services 
asia pacific reported increases of  in software revenue and increases of  in services revenue  which included an increase of  from consulting services 
europe reported increases of  in software revenue and increases of  in services revenue  which included an increase of  from consulting services 
systems revenues in totaled   and  for the americas  asia pacific and europe  respectively 
revenue growth in was also impacted from unfavorable foreign currency translation rates for the euro and the japanese yen 
revenue in the current year would have been approximately  if translated using the prior year s foreign currency translation rates 
revenue in local currencies increased and in asia pacific and europe  respectively 
our international operations in europe and asia pacific are sales organizations with high gross profit margins  which is due to these operations having minimal software development expenses 
as a result  we are exposed to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations of the united states dollar versus the japanese yen and the euro 
risks inherent in international revenue include the impact of longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  seasonality due to the slowdown in european business activity during the third quarter  tariffs and other trade barriers  and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international revenue 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by increased price competition and an increasingly higher revenue base from which to grow 
our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of existing orders as well as our ability to respond successfully to the pace of technological change and expand our customer base 
if our renewal rate or our pace of new customer acquisition slows  our net revenues and operating results would be adversely affected

the total gross investment in research and development activities for was  or of total software and services revenue  compared to  or of total software and services revenue  for the prior year 
the increase in total gross research and development expense was due to additional projects in process in as compared to the prior year

capitalized software development costs were  for compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
the amount of product development capitalized in any given period is a function of many factors  including the number of products under development at any point in time as well as their stage of development 
our product development process is continually under review to improve efficiency and product quality  and to reduce time to market 
due to the continual change in the product development process  there can be no assurance that the level of development capitalized in future periods will be comparable to current capitalized levels

additionally  certain other intangible assets will be classified as indefinite lived intangibles and will no longer be amortized beginning on january  pursuant to sfas no 
 we will test goodwill for impairment upon adoption and  if impairment is indicated  record an impairment loss as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

refer to note taxes based on income in notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and litigation  capitalized software costs and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition on software and related service we provide a variety of licensing alternatives for the use of our software products 
our software products have been primarily offered on an annual non cancelable  pre paid license basis 
an annual non cancelable  pre paid license is set at a fixed rate for the period and provides for payment in advance of use 
in recent years  demand has also increased for paid up licenses for software products 
a paid up license provides significant revenue at the original time of sale of the product  with smaller payments for maintenance following the time of sale 
we apply statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue on non cancelable  pre paid annual lease agreements is recognized monthly over the term of the agreement 
revenue from the sale of paid up licenses is recognized when we receive persuasive evidence of an arrangement generally a contract or purchase order  the software has been delivered to the customer  the price charged the customer is fixed or determinable at fair value  and collection is probable 
for multiple element arrangements when the specific objective evidence does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  we recognized revenue under the residual method 
under the residual method  at the outset of the arrangement with a customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements such as maintenance  and recognized the revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered  such as software licenses  when the criteria in sop have been met 
maintenance and support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period 
revenue to be recognized from software arrangements is driven to a large extent by the nature of our contractual commitments to customers 
if those commitments change in the future such that we are required to provide services that are essential to the functionality of the software purchased by us or we commit to future deliverables for which specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  the timing of when we will be able to recognize revenue will be delayed 
in addition  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts and litigation the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts  historical bad debt  trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  we do not currently maintain a reserve for any potential liability related to litigation 
management estimates a range of liability related to pending litigation based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we record the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on litigation  management maybe unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
capitalized software costs the company capitalizes software developed for sale or lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
software costs incurred subsequent to the determination of the technological feasibility of the software product are capitalized 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project 
capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs and projected revenues are reviewed quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established under sfas no 
the company has  of capitalized software as of december   net of accumulated amortization of  capitalized software amortization expense is included in cost of license revenue 
the amortization period for the software costs capitalized is the economic life of the related products  typically two to three years 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to  as of december  significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and projecting cash flows 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately  of goodwill acquired prior to july  we recorded  of amortization on these amounts during additionally  certain other intangible assets will be classified as indefinite lived intangibles and will no longer be amortized beginning on january  in lieu of amortization  we will be required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption may have on our consolidated results of operation and financial position 
our evaluation may result in an impairment under this new method of evaluating goodwill 
we disclose pro forma financial information we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
our pro forma financial information does not include unusual or non recurring events or transactions or amortization of goodwill 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
company trends during the past three years  we have engaged in a number of key strategic activities to expand our market opportunities 
these activities include the completion of four acquisitions to broaden the technology scope of our core simulation software products  expand into information systems reselling and integration  and establish a focused professional services group 
the professional services group includes traditional engineering consulting activities as well as extreme performance computing services  with special technical expertise in the use of linux and other related operating systems 
as an application service provider  we are utilizing the internet and web centric engineering software tools to broaden our customer base and expand our total available market 
liquidity and capital resources in the past  working capital needed to finance our operations has been provided by cash on hand and from cash flow from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations will continue to provide sufficient capital for normal working capital needs in the foreseeable future 
we may engage in additional financing methods that we believe are advantageous  particularly to finance acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will cease to amortize approximately  of goodwill acquired prior to july   we recorded  of amortization on these amounts during additionally  certain other intangible assets will be classified as indefinite lived intangibles and will no longer be amortized beginning on january  in lieu of amortization  we will be required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step we will compare the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we expect to complete the initial review during the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption may have on our consolidated results of operation and financial position 
our evaluation may result in an impairment under this new method of evaluating goodwill 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the asset 
as used in this statement  a legal obligation results from existing law  statute  ordinance  written or oral contract  or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 and develops a single accounting method under which long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf issues no 
 no 
and no 
accounting for points and certain other time or volume based sales incentive offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future 
we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of these issues on our financial statements or results of operations item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk international revenues are of our total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from our two foreign sales subsidiaries in germany and japan and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which cash from sales of our foreign subsidiaries are transferred back to the united states 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in was not significant 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risks for changes in interest rates relates to any borrowings under our line of credit 
refer to note financial instruments in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of us municipalities and other high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investment risk we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
this evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
we had no such impairments during the following table is a summary of investments december  fair market value rate of return fair market value rate of return equity securities   because of the factors stated throughout this document  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods
