item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we reported net loss of million for  compared to net income of million for our decrease in profitability primarily resulted from a million decrease in revenues  an increase of million in amortization and in process research and development primarily from our acquisition of new era of networks nen  and a million increase in restructuring costs offset by a million decrease in the provision for income taxes 
the affect of these changes was partially offset by a decrease in certain operating expenses as a result of a company wide restructuring program initiated in april in connection with our acquisition of nen and after announcement that our first quarter and revenues would be below expectations plan 
the plan  which was aimed at eliminating certain personnel  assets and facilities  aligning resources and streamlining company costs  resulted in the elimination of approximately million from our ongoing yearly cost structure 
see note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
despite the decline in profitability in  our financial position remains strong 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and cash investments  and stockholders equity of million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  we are organized into five separate business segments  two of which are majority owned subsidiaries  each focused on one of five key market segments enterprise solutions division esd  e business division ebd  business intelligence division bid  ianywhere solutions  inc ias  formerly our mobile and embedded computing division and financial fusion  inc ffi

we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principals require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue 
certain judgments  however  affect the application of our revenue policy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fees revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement is in force  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to delivered elements 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees are not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of license fees is dependent on performance of services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion 
we recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees 
license fees revenue for certain application development and data access tools are recognized upon direct shipment to the end user or direct shipment to the reseller for the end user 
if collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized only when the fee is collected 
maintenance and support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
revenues from consulting services under time and materials contracts and for training are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from other contract services are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting described above 
in order to apply the percentage of completion of method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets  which have generally resulted from our business combinations accounted for as purchases  are recorded at amortized cost 
we periodically review the carrying amounts of these intangible assets for indications of impairment based on the operational performance of the acquired businesses and market conditions 
if indications of impairment are present  we assess the value of the intangible assets using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  various restructuring activities as well as the overall economic conditions signaled an indication of impairment 
we then analyzed the value of our various intangibles by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets 
based on this analysis there was no impairment during future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
beginning in  the method for assessing potential impairments of intangibles will change based on new accounting rules issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  and related implementation guidance 
we estimate that these new rules will result in an impairment loss of approximately million in the first quarter of this loss will be recognized as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs after establishment of a product s technological feasibility 
such costs are then amortized over the estimated life of the related product 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the product  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future costs of completing and disposing of certain products 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that likely will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we determined during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period 
restructuring during  we recorded significant accruals in connection with our restructuring program 
these accruals included estimated costs to settle certain lease obligations  and were generally based on the analysis of independent real estate consultants 
while we do not anticipate significant changes to these estimates  the actual costs may differ from the estimates 
if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees or if rental rates continue to decrease in the markets where the properties are located  or it takes us longer then expected to find suitable sublease tenants  the actual costs could exceed our estimates 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to product  technology  labor  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
results of operations revenues change change dollars in millions license fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues total revenues total revenues for decreased percent from total revenues in which had increased percent over 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a decline in license fees revenues as a result of a weaker economy  and partially offset by an increase in our technical support services revenues resulting from an overall increase in our installed base 
this increase was partially attributable to our acquisition of nen and its customer base 
the increase in from was due to growth in both our license revenue and technical support revenue 
license fees revenues in decreased percent over license fees revenues which had increased percent over 
the decrease in was largely due to decreased sales of our enterprise database and enterprise application products 
this resulted from a weakened economy in which customers delayed or canceled many infrastructure investments requiring significant dollars and resources 
existing sybase products and products acquired through the acquisition of nen were equally affected by this phenomenon 
from a segment standpoint  enterprise database revenues were primarily captured by esd  while enterprise application revenues were primarily captured by ebd 
the increase in license fees revenues in was primarily due to increased sales of our esd enterprise database  ebd enterprise application products  and ias mobile database products 
services revenues derived from technical support  education and professional services grew percent in over which had increased percent over 
the increase in was primarily due to a percent increase in technical support revenues 
partially offsetting this increase was a percent decrease in education and professional services revenues for compared to the decrease was partially due to the economic factors discussed above  and partly due to our plan  which reduced professional services headcount to de emphasize building future capacity  and to focus instead on current profitable engagements 
the increase in services revenues during was attributable to a percent increase in revenues from technical support and an percent increase in professional services revenues 
the increase in technical support revenues was primarily due to an increase in our installed base  and the increase in professional services which primarily resulted from our acquisition of hfn now ffi

the decrease was partially offset by a percent increase in technical support revenues 
the decrease in north america revenues was largely the result of the economic factors discussed under revenues above 
the increase in north america revenues in was due primarily to an increase in license fees revenues from our enterprise database  enterprise application and mobile database products  and an overall increase in our professional services revenues see discussion above

a percent increase in intercontinental services revenues was attributable to an increase in technical support revenues 
in general  the economic conditions within the intercontinental region have been significantly less robust than those in europe and north america due to the severe recessionary conditions faced by many of the countries in the region which began in our business in the region has seen steady growth since across virtually all product offerings and services 
in europe and the intercontinental region  most revenues and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues was not material in   or although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the strength of local economies  and the general volatility of software markets may result in a higher or lower proportion of international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the future

the cost of license fees expense increased percent in over in  these costs decreased percent from the increase was primarily due to the amortization of purchased technology acquired in the nen transaction  partially offset by decreases in amortization of capitalized software costs and third party royalties 
the decrease in cost of license fees was primarily due to decreased third party royalties which were partially offset by increases in amortization of capitalized software costs and the amortization of purchased technology acquired in the hfn transaction

this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the costs associated with third party consultants  and consultants acquired in the nen transaction 
the increase in cost of services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues in over was primarily due to an increase in the number of consulting personnel located in north america partially attributable to the acquisition of hfn  and market driven increases in the labor costs associated with consulting personnel 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased percent during compared to which had increased percent over 
sales and marketing expenses remained consistent at percent of total revenues in   and however  the decrease in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to a decrease in sales commissions due to lower license fees revenues and reductions in sales and marketing personnel in the plan  and a decrease in certain allocated common costs 
partially offsetting these decreases were sales and marketing expenses associated with nen 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily due to sales expenses associated with increased revenues including the addition of hfn  and certain marketing programs undertaken during the year 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was partially offset by a decrease in allocated common costs 
we allocate various common costs including certain legal expenses  accounting  human resources  external consulting  employee benefits  and facilities costs to sales and marketing  product development and engineering  and general and administrative expenses 
the common costs in were lower than those in primarily due to a cut back in discretionary spending in response to weaker economic conditions  and the plan 
the common costs in were higher than those in due to certain litigation costs during  the costs associated with internal yk compliance  and the streamlining of certain back office functions during product development and engineering product development and engineering expenses net of capitalized software development costs decreased percent in from which had decreased percent from 
these expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to percent in compared to percent in  and were percent of total revenues in the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software development costs  a decrease in certain research and development expenses due to a greater percentage of r d personnel employed in lower cost facilities  and a decrease in allocated common costs  partially offset by costs attributable to nen s product development and engineering efforts 
the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in personnel expenses and allocated common costs 
we capitalize product development and engineering costs during the period between achievement of technological feasibility and general availability of the product 
capitalized amounts totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in the significant increase in amounts capitalized in compared to was primarily attributable to capitalized costs associated with the development of products acquired in the nen transaction  and other products captured within ebd

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to which decreased percent from 
general and administrative expenses represented percent of total revenues in compared to percent  and percent in the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was primarily due to the added costs associated with the acquisition of nen 
the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in allocated common costs which were partially offset by the added costs associated with the acquisition of hfn 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles increased percent during compared to which increased percent over 
these costs were percent of total revenues in compared to percent in  and percent in the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was primarily due to the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles arising from the nen acquisition 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was attributable to amortization of goodwill and the established customer list associated with the hfn acquisition 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in an increase in pre tax net income of approximately million in  million in  and million in in process research and development nen in connection with our acquisition of nen  we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development 
these amounts were written off during the quarter ended june  in analyzing this acquisition  the decision was made to acquire technology  including in process technology  rather than to develop it internally 
this decision was based on factors such as the amount of internal expertise  time and cost it would take to bring the technology to market 
nen technologies enable e business and operational applications to share critical information 
nen s software solutions support integration of internet and core business packaged applications  application server platforms  industry standard protocols  and proprietary systems 
as of february  the acquisition date nen was undergoing development efforts to release the next version of e biz integrator  process server tm  adapters  and emerging products such as open business interchange sm 
these development efforts were all proprietary  internal projects 
at the acquisition date  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and had no alternative future uses 
in assessing the qualification of nen s various ongoing research and development projects  each project was examined to determine whether technological feasibility had been established as of the acquisition date 
our assessment was based on extensive interviews and a detailed analysis of research and development plans 
if the project required additional planning  designing  coding or testing activities to determine whether the associated product could be produced to meet its design specifications  we determined that technological feasibility had not been reached with respect to this project 
due to the complexity and specialized features of the acquired research and development  the technologies under development could only be economically used for their specific and intended purposes in the e business integration industry 
the features and functions of the products were being developed for specific purposes  and if nen failed in its efforts  no alternative economic value would result from these efforts 
accordingly  the value allocated to projects that had not reached technology feasibility was immediately expensed at the acquisition date 
we estimated the fair value of in process research and development using an income approach 
this involved estimating the fair value of the in process research and development using risk adjusted discount rates 
the selection of the discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted to reflect risks associated with the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances known at the time  and each technologies degree of completion 
projected future net cash flow attributable to nen s in process research and development  assuming successful development  were discounted to net present value using a discount rate of percent 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amount so determined represents fair value and does not exceed the amount another third party would pay for the projects 
revenue estimates in this context were based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
this analysis included the revenues projected to result from the expected evolution of the technology over time 
operating expenses used in our analysis included selling  general and administrative and research and development 
these expenses were based on an overall analysis of the business enterprise 
total research and development was divided into the costs to complete the in process research and development projects and costs for developed products that had already been introduced to the market 
the allocation was based on an analysis of resources relating to the development of research and development 
costs to complete in process projects were estimated by management 
these costs were allocated based on an analysis of completion efforts and expected completion dates 
costs to complete were further allocated between in process and future revenues based on an analysis of the evolution of the respective technologies 
nen expected to achieve a target margin of approximately percent from its in process products 
profitability was expected to be significantly lower in the first years of the products lifecycle compared to the later years due to higher level of sales and marketing expense in the earlier years as a percentage of revenue 
the financial forecasts included only results that were expected to be generated by nen on a standalone basis  and did not take into consideration synergies resulting from our acquisition 
to properly analyze the research and development efforts that had been accomplished as of the acquisition date  and to exclude the completion of development efforts underway  it was necessary to adjust the overall forecasts associated with the research and development projects to reflect only those accomplishments completed as of the acquisition date 
the relative contribution made by the completed research and development efforts was assessed based on a variety of factors including absolute development time  costs incurred to date  management estimates  a detailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed compared to the tasks required to complete the efforts  and the associated risks 
nen s in process research and development projects were estimated to be between percent and percent complete as of the acquisition date 
development of the majority of the in process technologies began in early and was substantially completed in the fall of at the acquisition date  approximately engineers were engaged in the development of nen s in process technologies 
completion of these projects is expected to require significant efforts involving continued software development as well as the testing and re qualification efforts required to turn the technologies into a set of bug free  commercial ready products 
these remaining tasks involved substantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved 
actual results of our research and development efforts to date have been consistent in all material respects with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
hfn in connection with the acquisition of hfn in the quarter ended march   we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development 
as part of the process of analyzing this acquisition  the decision was made to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than to develop the technology internally 
this decision was based on factors such as the amount of time and costs it would take to bring the technology to market 
hfn had been involved in the development of technologies that enable financial institutions to deliver their services to customers via the internet 
on the date we acquired hfn january   hfn was conducting development and qualification activities related to a suite of products encompassing bill presentment  small business functions  alternate service delivery methods and related underlying software technology 
at that time  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value allocated to these projects was immediately expensed at the date of acquisition 
we estimated the fair value of in process research and development using an income approach 
this involved estimating the fair value of the in process research and development by determining the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates 
the selection of the discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted to reflect risks associated with the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances known at the time  and each technologies degree of completion 
projected future net cash flows attributable to hfn s in process research and development  assuming successful development  were discounted to net present value using a discount rate of percent 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amount so determined represents fair value and does not exceed the amount another third party would pay for the projects 
revenue estimates were based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
the analysis of the in process technology was determined by incorporating the revenue related to the expected evolution of the technology over time 
once developed  the estimated lifecycle of the product suite was estimated to be approximately to years 
as a whole  hfn was expected to exhibit compound annual growth of approximately percent in the period from through it was projected that the suite of products resulting from the in process research and development efforts would begin generating revenue in and positive cash flow in operating expenses included selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
total research and development was divided into i the costs to complete the in process research and development projects and ii costs for developed products that had already been introduced to the market  including product maintenance 
costs to complete in process projects were estimated by management 
these costs were allocated based on an analysis of expected project completion dates 
the resultant target margin that hfn expected to achieve from the in process products was approximately percent 
profitability was expected to be significantly lower in the first several years of the product suite s lifecycle compared to the latter years due to a higher level of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in the earlier years 
the financial forecasts only included results we expected hfn to generate on a standalone basis  and did not take into consideration synergies resulting from our acquisition 
to properly analyze the research and development efforts that had been accomplished to date and exclude the effort to be completed on the development efforts underway  it was necessary to adjust the overall forecasts associated with the research and development projects to reflect only the accomplishments made as of the date of the acquisition towards the ultimate completion of the in process r d projects 
the relative contribution made on the research and development efforts was assessed based on a variety of factors including absolute development time costs incurred to date  management estimates  and a detailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed compared to the tasks required to complete the efforts and the associated risks 
overall  hfn s in process research and development projects were estimated to be approximately percent complete 
hfn estimated that the projects would be completed in march  after which time it expected to begin generating economic benefits from the completed projects 
as of the valuation date  approximately man months totaling  had been expended on the in process research and development projects 
in total  costs to complete hfn s in process research and development were expected to be approximately  and require man months of work 
completion of these projects was expected to require significant efforts involving continued software development as well as the testing and re qualification efforts required to turn a new to the world software suite into a set of bug free  commercial ready products 
these remaining tasks involved substantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved 
historically  many of hfn s in process research and development projects have required rework and additional expenditures in comparable stages of development 
the research and development efforts described above are substantially complete and actual results of our research and development efforts to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the hfn acquisition 
stock compensation expense stock compensation expense reflects non cash compensation expense associated with restricted stock granted to certain individuals in the three months ended june   and the amortization of the value assigned to certain unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition of nen 
cost reversal of restructuring the company s plan included restructuring charges of million during the quarter ended june   restructuring charges of million during the quarter ended september   and restructuring charges of million during the quarter ended december  the goal of the plan was to align our cost structure with anticipated revenues 
we terminated a total of employees  closed or consolidated more than facilities worldwide  wrote down certain assets no longer needed for future business operations  and incurred various other exit activity expenses directly related to the plan 
the amounts included in the plan were as follows cash q q q non cash total dollars in millions termination payments to employees and other related costs cash lease cancellations and commitments cash write downs of property  equipment and improvements non cash other cash termination payments to employees and other related costs during the second quarter of  the company incurred a restructuring charge of million for severance payments and other termination benefits provided to approximately employees 
during the third quarter of  the company incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance payments and other termination benefits provided to approximately employees 
during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance payments and other termination benefits provided to approximately employees 
severance payments and termination benefits were accrued and charged to restructuring costs in the period that amounts were determined and communicated to the affected employees 
during the fourth quarter  the company evaluated the costs associated with providing medical coverage and other benefits to certain employees terminated in the second and third quarters 
as a result of the company s experience through the end of the fourth quarter  the amount of the severance accrual relating to medical coverage and other benefits was reduced by approximately million 
in addition  there was a reversal in the fourth quarter to the severance accrual for approximately million associated with a number of individuals who were either not terminated after they were asked to stay to fill positions voluntarily vacated by employees not included in the restructuring plan  or were foreign employees paid less then the amount originally provided after a legal proceeding to determine the severance amount as required under local law 
the above reversal was recorded by a corresponding credit to restructuring expense 
lease cancellations and commitments during the second quarter of  sybase incurred restructuring charges of million for facilities consolidated or closed in boulder  colorado  emeryville  california  hartford  connecticut  englewood  colorado  milpitas  california  new york  new york  southfield  michigan  watertown  massachusetts  westport  connecticut  and orem  utah 
the company also incurred restructuring charges of million for facilities consolidated or closed in canada  the united kingdom  belgium  spain and sweden 
during the third quarter of  sybase incurred restructuring charges of million for facilities consolidated or closed in boston  massachusetts  and in the united kingdom 
during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred restructuring charges of million for facilities consolidated or closed in california  colorado  florida  virginia  mexico  argentina  puerto rico  japan  france and switzerland 
in addition  based on the analysis of independent real estate consultants  and reflecting changes in the economic conditions since the original accruals were established  the company recorded additional restructuring charges of million during the fourth quarter to provide for the current estimated cost to consolidate or close facilities in california  colorado  georgia  michigan  utah  massachusetts  new york and the uk 
the offices included above were primarily used for the sale of sybase software products  professional services and customer support  and in certain instances research and development 
these restructuring charges reflect the remaining contractual obligations under the facility leases and certain costs associated with the expected sublease of the facilities  net of anticipated sublease income from the date of abandonment to the end of the lease term 
certain facilities described above continued in use during the completion of the restructuring 
the company continued to record monthly rent expense on these facilities as an operating expense until the facilities were abandoned 
during the fourth quarter of  approximately million was reversed by a corresponding credit to restructuring expense  a second quarter accrual established to terminate a lease on a building which was later destroyed during the terrorist attacks of september th 
during the fourth quarter the company was notified that no additional payments would be required under the lease on the facility  and as a result the associated restructuring accrual was reversed 
write downs of property  equipment and furniture in the second and third quarters of  sybase incurred restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  which were primarily related to the impairment of the carrying values of leaseholds and certain furniture attributable to facilities closed in connection with the restructuring 
the assets were all taken out of service and held for disposal at the date the associated facility was closed 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a restructuring charge of million  which was related to the impairment of the carrying value of certain computer equipment and software associated with individuals terminated during the year for which there was no intended alternative use  and leaseholds and certain furniture attributable to facilities closed in connection with the restructuring 
other during the second quarter of  the company incurred a restructuring charge of million associated with certain other restructuring related exit expenses  including legal costs associated with the severance of employees  travel and security costs associated with the termination of employees  and fees associated with the cancellation of certain obligations  and relocation expenses for certain terminated expatriates 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company incurred restructuring charges of million for professional fees associated with the restructuring 
the following table summarizes the activity related to the restructuring accrued liabilities total amounts amounts amounts at charges paid written off reversed dollars in millions termination payments to employees and other related costs lease cancellations and commitments costs related to the write down of assets other it is estimated that the remaining accruals relating to termination benefits and other restructuring relating activities will be paid by the second quarter of the payments of accruals related to lease cancellations and commitments which are dependent upon market conditions and our ability to negotiate acceptable lease buy out outs or locate suitable subleases  will be paid over a period not to exceed nine years 
as of december   we had completed substantially all of the employee terminations identified during the second and third quarters 
approximately of the employees identified in the fourth quarter were notified of their termination benefits  but had not received their severance payments at december operating income loss change change dollars in millions operating income loss percentage of total revenues operating income in decreased percent over which had increased percent over

in  the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in license fees revenues and the increase in operating expenses including expenses associated with the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles  the million write off of in process research and development relating to the acquisition of nen and plan restructuring charges 
these decreases were partially offset by the increase in services revenues 
the increase in operating income in  compared to  is primarily due to an increase in total revenues and the continued benefit from the restructure actions taken in that kept sales and marketing  product development and engineering  and general and administrative expenses equal to or lower than the levels obtained  as a percentage of revenue

provision for income taxes change change dollars in millions provision for income taxes in income taxes of million were recorded on pre tax book income of million 
the income tax expense primarily results for taxes on earnings generated in certain international jurisdictions 
overall  we had significant pre tax earnings in foreign jurisdictions and a significant pre tax loss in the us the us loss primarily resulted from the amortization or write off of intangibles acquired in various acquisitions accounted for as purchases  and the plan 
a significant increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  primarily the amortization or write off of intangibles acquired in the nen acquisition  made the tax rate as a percentage of s pre tax income of million  meaningless when compared to and in  taxes were recorded at a rate of percent on pre tax income  while taxes in were recorded at a percent rate 
the and tax provisions were the result of taxable earnings generated from operations in both the us and certain international jurisdictions 
the provision benefited from a million reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance reversed related to certain research and development tax credits that we believe will generate a tax benefit in future periods given their carryforward periods 
the reversal of the valuation allowance is a non recurring benefit  and will not impact our provision for income taxes in future years 
the benefit of the valuation allowance reversal was offset somewhat in by an increase in expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes 
these expenses were primarily the amortization of goodwill and established customer lists  the write off of in process research and development and the amortization of purchased technology relating to the acquisition of hfn 
we had a net deferred tax asset of million at december  this deferred tax asset included a valuation allowance of million 
as of december   the gross deferred tax asset included research and development tax credits of million  foreign tax credits of million and an asset for certain net operating losses of million 
the research and development tax credits expire in years from through  the foreign tax credits expire in years from through and the net operating losses expire in years from and in order to realize the net deferred tax assets we must generate sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions so that we can obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
any such adjustments to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such adjustment was made

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the same period in net cash used for investing activities decreased percent between and the decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to net cash gained from business combinations  primarily the million acquired in the nen acquisition  compared to net cash used  primarily in connection with the hfn acquisition  for the same period last year 
in addition  cash of approximately million was generated from the sale and maturity of cash investments during compared to a net cash investment of million in such securities during net cash used for investing activities increased percent between and this increase was primarily attributable to million used for business combinations  namely our acquisition of hfn  the use of million to purchase minority equity investments in five early stage e business companies and a million security deposit on a year non cancelable lease associated with our new dublin  california facility 
this increase was partially offset by a million year over year decrease in cash investments 
in  we sold our facility in concord  massachusetts and simultaneously entered into a sales leaseback agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we entered into a seven year operating lease 
the sales price of million resulted in a book gain of million  which will be amortized over the seven year lease period 
net cash used for financing activities increased percent between and and percent between and the increases in both and were primarily the result of an increase in the cash used to repurchase our common stock during and beginning in  the board of directors authorized sybase to repurchase its outstanding common stock in open market transactions from time to time  subject to price and other conditions 
through december  aggregate amounts authorized under the repurchase program total million 
under this program  we repurchased million shares of our common stock in at a cost if million  million shares in at a cost of million  and million shares in at a cost of million 
we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december   excluding million in restricted cash already set aside for leasehold improvements associated with the move to our new dublin  california facility 
we expect to fund expenditures for future capital requirements  liquidity and strategic operating programs from a combination of available cash balances and internally generated funds 
we have no outside debt  and do not have any plans to enter into borrowing arrangements 
we engage in global business operations and are therefore exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had identifiable assets totaling million associated with our european operations and million associated with our asia and latin american operations 
we experience foreign exchange transaction exposure on our net assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these assets are considered by sybase inc  the us parent company  to be a permanent investment in the respective subsidiaries  the related foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss under stockholders equity on the balance sheet 
we also experience foreign exchange translation exposure from certain balances that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on whose books the balance resides 
we hedge certain of these short term exposures under a plan approved by the board of directors

sfas  which supercedes sfas  establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of this statement are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of this unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment would then be measured in the second step 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in an increase in pre tax net income of approximately million in  million in  and million in during  we performed  under sfas  the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  that test indicated that the carrying values of certain reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values  as determined utilizing various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow and comparative market analysis 
thereafter  given the indication of a potential impairment  we completed step two of the test 
based on this analysis  we will recognize an impairment loss of approximately million in the first quarter of this loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
during the applicable accounting policy for measuring goodwill impairment was an undiscounted cash flow basis  a method required by sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
when analyzed using undiscounted cash flows prescribed by sfas  we did not have an impairment of any intangibles assets at december  in june  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
the provisions of this statement are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in november  the fasb issued a staff announcement topic no 
d topic d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
topic d establishes that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
we are required to adopt the guidance effective january  we currently record out of pocket expense reimbursements as a reduction to operating expenses 
beginning in january   we will record these reimbursements as service fees revenue  which will result in increased revenue and increased operating expenses 
comparative financial statements for prior year information will be reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
the application of topic d will not result in any impact to operating or net income in any past or future periods 
the provisions of this statement are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition of operating results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which amended sfas by deferring the effective date to the fiscal year beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued fsas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment to fasb statement no 
which amended fsas with respect to four specific issues 
we adopted fsas as amended  for the year ending december  the adoption of fsas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
financial risk management foreign exchange risk as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non dollar denominated sales and expenses in europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures outstanding during the period approximately days 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts mitigate the gains and losses on our outstanding foreign currency transactions 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in interest expense and other  net 
the unrealized gain loss on the outstanding forward contracts as of december  was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
the tables below provide information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of december  and all of the outstanding forward contracts at december   had maturities of approximately days 
the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was not material as of december  and us notional average forward contracts amount contract rate amounts in thousands except exchange rates contracts for the sale of us dollars and purchase of canadian dollars  swedish krona  euro  singapore dollars contracts for purchase of us dollars and sale of swiss franc  contracts for purchase of euros and sale of swedish krona swiss franc  uk pound  norwegian krone  total  notional average forward contracts amount contract rate amounts in thousands except exchange rates contracts for the purchase of us dollars japanese yen  contracts for sale of us dollars canadian dollars  euro  contracts for purchase of euros swedish krona  swiss franc  uk pound  norwegian krone  total  interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  which consists of taxable  short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and two years 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and cash investments as all of these investments are at fixed interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest investment grade securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our investment portfolio  since all investments are made in securities with fixed interest rates 
future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period due to a variety of significant risks  some of which are discussed in this report on form k 
we strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report  including those regarding forward looking statements set forth on page of this report 
stock price volatility our ability to exceed  or our failure to achieve  expected operating results for any period could significantly impact our stock price 
inevitably  some investors will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the timing of their investment 
the market for our stock and for technology stocks in general has been highly volatile  and the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in recent years 
the stock price may continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors  including our financial results  press and industry analyst reports regarding our company and other high technology companies  market acceptance of our products  services and pricing policies  the activities of our competitors  acquisitions of other businesses and technologies and other events  including acts of war and other related events such as the september  terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york 
revenue related factors the timing and amount of our revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to accurately estimate revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
historically  our license fees revenues have tended to decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the following year 
this has contributed to lower total revenues and earnings in the first quarter compared to the preceding fourth quarter 
we currently anticipate that this seasonal pattern will continue 
since we operate with little or no backlog  quarterly revenues depend largely on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  we have recorded to of our quarterly revenues in the last month of each quarter  particularly during the final two weeks of that month 
our customers include many large enterprises that make substantial investments in our products and services 
therefore  the inability to record one or more large orders from a customer at the very end of a quarter could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
our operating expenses are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels  and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter 
since we strive to align our cost structure with anticipated future revenues on an ongoing basis  failure to realize projected revenues for a specified period could impact operating results  causing an operating loss for that period  as occurred in the second and third quarters of this year  and in the first and fourth quarters of in north america  we currently ship most of our products from our emeryville  california distribution facility 
because we tend to record a high percentage of revenues during the last two weeks of each quarter  disruption of operations at this distribution facility at that time eg  relocation of some or all of this facility to dublin  california as is planned in the first quarter of  natural calamity  acts of war  governmental intervention or systems failure could directly harm our ability to record revenues for such quarter 
this could  in turn  have an adverse impact on operating results 
competition the market for our products and services is extremely competitive  and is marked by dynamic customer demands  short product life cycles  and the rapid emergence of the e business marketplace 
we have numerous competitors  including large companies such as oracle corporation  microsoft corporation  and ibm corporation  as well as smaller highly aggressive firms 
many of these companies may have greater financial  technical  sales  and marketing resources  and certain of these companies have larger installed customer bases 
in addition  our competitors advertising and marketing efforts could adversely influence customer perception of our products and services  and harm our business and prospects as a result 
to remain competitive  we must be able to develop new customers and new products  enhance existing products and retain competitive pricing policies in a timely manner 
our failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business  and on the market price of our stock 
product development increasing widespread use of the internet may significantly alter how we do business in the future 
this  in turn  could affect our ability to timely meet the demand for new or enhanced products and services at competitive prices 
in march  we began shipping the latest version of sybase enterprise portal  the industry s first enterprise class portal product designed to enable organizations to provide personalized business interfaces to employees  customers  partners and suppliers 
with our acquisition of nen in april  we gained the ability to offer enterprise application integrators that integrate sybase enterprise portal with other applications 
sybase enterprise portal solutions are intended to enable successful e business strategies for organizations transacting business via the internet 
as a general matter  deployment of enterprise portals has increased dramatically in recent years  and we believe that increasing demand for enterprise portal solutions will enhance our revenues and profitability 
however  if the market does not continue to develop as anticipated  or if our enterprise portal solutions and services do not successfully compete in the marketplace  increased revenues and profitability may not be realized 
our future results may also be affected if our products cannot interoperate and perform well with software products of other companies 
certain leading applications currently are not interoperable with our products  and others may never be 
in addition  many of our principal products are designed for use with products offered by competitors 
in the future  vendors of non sybase products may become less willing to provide us with access to their products  technical information  and marketing and sales support  which could harm our business and prospects 
divisional sales model we are organized into five separate business segments  each of which maintains financial accountability for its operating results  dedicated product development and engineering  product marketing  partner relationship management and customer support teams 
this structure is intended to enhance overall revenues and profitability by providing increased focus on our key markets 
in january  the acquisition of hfn now ffi increased our focus on the financial services vertical market 
in may  we announced the launch of ias  a subsidiary formed to continue the business of the former mec division in mobile  wireless and embedded products and services 
ebd was created in the second quarter of and consists of certain operations of nen along with certain products previously in the esd segment and certain products previously in the former internet applications division 
for more information regarding our divisional sales model  see note ten to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
further changes in our divisional sales model could have a direct affect on our results of operations 
if we have misjudged demand for our products and services in our target markets  or if our divisions and subsidiaries generally are unable to coordinate their respective sales efforts in a focused and efficient way  this could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects 
international operations we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations 
at the end of fourth quarter of  these revenues represented of our total revenues 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for a discussion of risks associated with currency fluctuation  see financial risk management above  incorporated here by reference 
our revenues from international operations could also fluctuate due to the relative immaturity of some markets  rapid growth in other markets  and organizational changes we have made to accommodate these conditions 
for example  in february  we acquired our distributor in denmark and in september  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of our distributor in mexico 
during and  we closed subsidiaries in mexico  thailand  chile  peru and venezuela 
several significant management and organizational changes occurred in the same period  including the resignation or replacement of several country managers in europe and asia and the european general manager 
other factors that could affect aspects of our international operations include changes in political  regulatory  or economic conditions changes or limitations in trade protection laws changes in tax treaties or laws favorable to sybase natural disasters  political unrest and acts of war intellectual property our inability to obtain adequate copyright  patent or trade secret protection for our products in certain countries may have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
also  as the number of software products and associated patents increase  it is possible that software developers will become subject to more frequent infringement claims 
for information about material litigation involving trademark infringement claims  see note twelve to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
in the past  third parties have claimed that our products violated their patents or other proprietary rights 
it is possible that such claims will be asserted in the future 
also  to the extent we acquire other technologies  whether directly from third parties or through acquisitions of other companies  we face the possibility that such intellectual property will be found to infringe or violate the proprietary rights of others 
regardless of whether these claims have merit  they can be time consuming and expensive to defend or settle  and can harm our business and reputation 
we do not believe any of our products infringe any third party patents or proprietary rights  but there is no guarantee that we can avoid claims or findings of infringement in the future 
human resources our inability to hire and retain qualified technical  managerial  sales and other employees could affect our product development and sales efforts  other aspects of our operations  and our financial results 
the relatively high cost of living in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located  could also impact the degree of future employee turnover 
in recent years  we have experienced a number of changes in our board of directors and in our executive management team 
for example  in july  richard moore joined us as senior vice president and general manager of our newly created v business group 
in october  billy ho  our senior vice president and general manager of ebd  replaced george f 
rick adam  former ceo of nen who had previously been appointed to the position when we acquired nen in april these and other changes involving executives and managers resulting from acquisitions  mergers and other events could increase the current rate of employee turnover  particularly in consulting  engineering and sales 
additionally  further changes in board membership could affect the company s current strategic business plans 
acquisitions and strategic relationships we continually explore possible acquisitions and other strategic ventures to expand and enhance our business 
we have recently acquired or invested in a number of companies and will likely continue to do so in the future 
for a further discussion of our recent acquisitions  see note eleven to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
we may not achieve the desired benefits of our acquisitions and investments 
for example  we may be unable to successfully assimilate an acquired company s management team  business infrastructure  company culture  or other important factors 
also  dedication of additional resources to handle integration the integration of new companies could temporarily divert attention from other important business 
such acquisitions could also result in costs  liabilities  inherited litigation and other additional expenses that could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
with respect to our investments in other companies  we may not realize a return on our investments  or the value of our investments may decline if the businesses in which we invest are not successful 
these companies include start ups seeking to develop technology that has not been tested in the marketplace 
such companies typically have no history of earnings and may lack a seasoned management team and or a well defined operating infrastructure 
euro currency on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the euro 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
a transition period for conversion to this new currency ends on january  to date  there has been no significant impact on our worldwide operations caused by the adoption of the euro 
the introduction and the use of the euro has not materially affected  and is not expected to affect in the future  our foreign exchange activities  our use of derivatives and other financial instruments  or result in any material cost to us 
we will continue to assess the impact of the introduction of the euro currency
