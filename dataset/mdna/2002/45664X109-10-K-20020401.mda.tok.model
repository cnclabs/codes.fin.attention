page in  in response to excess supply of internet server hosting capacity  the company suspended operations at the metropolitan atlanta facility and suspended the further development of the northern virginia facility 
the company is evaluating options with respect to the use of these facilities 
the company is reviewing potential use or disposition strategies including  but not limited to  alternate uses of each facility in non colocation outsourcing activities  subleasing all or a part of each facility either for the remaining lease term or some shorter period  renegotiating the terms of a lease  and negotiating the termination of a lease 
in conducting its assessment  the company has reviewed many factors including  but not limited to  its projected operating plans  prevailing real estate market conditions  supply and demand estimates for colocation space  and alternate uses of each facility either by the company or to another potential tenant or subtenant 
the company also assessed whether the prevailing conditions with respect to each factor were temporary or permanent 
if the company decides to sublease all or part of a facility  the company must determine if it will incur a loss in connection therewith 
if the estimated future cash inflows are exceeded by the sum of i estimated future cash outflows and ii unamortized capitalized costs related to the subleased portion of a facility  the company will recognize a loss 
similarly  costs incurred in connection with a termination of a lease  as well as the abandonment of unamortized capital costs related to the facility subject to such lease  will result in a loss 
finally  any amount of unamortized capitalized costs related to a facility or lease that are not recoverable from future cash flows either from the company s use or subleasing of a facility must be recognized as a loss 
based on its analysis and estimates of the options available to the company  management has recorded a loss of  as of december  approximately one half of the loss relates to the write off of capitalized costs 
the amount of the loss may increase in future periods if the conditions or assumptions impacting the company s current assessment adversely change or the company commits to a course of action that would result in a larger estimated loss

critical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u 
s  which requires the selection and application of significant accounting policies  and which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting polices 
revenue recognition the majority of revenues are invoiced on a monthly recurring basis under long term contracts  typically ranging from one to five years in length  providing for either fixed monthly fees or time and material billings 
revenue is recognized under these contracts when the company processes the agreed upon transactions in accordance with the contractual performance standards  or performs the services  and collection is reasonably assured 
application of these standards can involve management s judgments  including judgment as to the collection of invoiced amounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
page tangible and intangible assets the company has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet  primarily property and equipment  deferred software costs  and intangible assets  primarily goodwill  related to acquisitions 
the assignment of useful lives to these assets and the valuation and classification of intangible assets involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these tangible and intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
the company s assets are tested and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis under the established accounting guidelines 
changes in business conditions or changes in the decisions of management as to how assets will be deployed in the company s operations could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
new financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company will apply statement beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of statement is expected to result in an increase in net income of  per share in the company will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company expects to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first half of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the company has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no
