strategic refocusing and other restructuring in july  huntington announced a strategic refocusing plan 
this plan included the sale of huntington s florida operations  the consolidation of numerous non florida branch offices  credit related and other actions to strengthen huntington s balance sheet 
these actions were designed to attain more positive revenue and earnings for shareholders and to improve capital efficiency 
huntington announced that it expected to record total restructuring and special charges of approximately million pre tax million after tax related to this refocusing plan

the combined charges related to the strategic refocusing plan and the items announced in the fourth quarter amounted to million on a pre tax basis 
related income taxes were million  resulting in after tax charges of million 
by the end of the first quarter of  huntington expects to complete its strategic refocusing plan 
the final costs associated with the actions taken could be to higher than the original pre tax estimate of million

total assets were billion at december   approximating asset levels at the end of last year

managed average total loans  which include securitized loans see note to huntington s consolidated financial statements for further information regarding securitized loans  increased over the prior year  after adjusting for portfolio sales and the empire banc corporation purchase acquisition in average commercial loans showed modest growth of during the recent year  hindered by the weakening economy and continued slow down in automobile floor plan lending 
floor plan loans declined versus last year due to reduced dealer inventories and very aggressive financing offered by captive auto finance companies

average consumer loans increased during the recent twelve month period  driven by strong double digit growth in home equity lines  an area of focus and a strong source of growth for huntington 
strong cross selling success to first mortgage customers during the heavy refinancing period in contributed to this growth 
first mortgage refinancing activity fueled by the falling interest rate environment led to an increase in residential real estate loans and an increase in mortgage loans held for sale at year end 
indirect automobile loan and leases increased  although loan origination volumes slowed somewhat towards the latter portion of due to the zero percent financing offered by many captive finance companies 
core deposits  which are total deposits exclusive of negotiable certificates of deposits and eurodollar deposits  were billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
average core deposits increased slightly during the year due primarily to huntington s sales management process aimed at attracting more retail deposits and  to a lesser extent  the uncertainties in the financial markets 
when combined with other core funding sources  these provided of huntington s funding needs 
short and medium term borrowings continued to decline as a result of efforts initiated last year in huntington s balance sheet repositioning program 
long term debt increased over last year primarily due to huntington s million sale to the public of fixed rate preferred securities of its reit subsidiary 
results of operations net interest income one of huntington s primary sources of revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest expense on funding sources  including interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the level of interest rates  earning assets  and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income are measured through interest spread and net interest margin 
the difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities represents the interest spread 
the net interest margin is the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
both the interest spread and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis  which means that tax free income and dividend income  generated primarily from huntington s investment security portfolio  are adjusted and expressed on the same basis as other taxable income 
because non interest bearing sources of funds  such as demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support earning assets  the net interest margin exceeds the interest spread

interest income expense in millions of dollars average rate tax equivalent net interest income was  million in  million in  and  million in the net interest margin was during the recent year  compared with and for and  respectively 
the increase in the recent year was due to the continued improvement in the earning asset mix  resulting from a reduction in lower margin investment securities and reduction in residential mortgage loans 
additionally  huntington was slightly liability sensitive during the period and accordingly  benefited from the decline in short term rates during the year 
the net interest margin in was unfavorably impacted by higher funding costs due to rising interest rates and changes in the mix of huntington s core deposit base 
the mix of deposits shifted to higher rate accounts during that year following the introduction of new products designed to improve customer retention in the intensely competitive market for retail deposits 
the reduction in net interest income and the margin in also reflect the impact of the credit card sale and the automobile loan securitizations 
average earning assets declined million from billion in to billion while average interest bearing liabilities declined million from billion to billion 
management expects the margin to continue to expand in  especially in light of the favorable impact expected from the sale of the florida operations  as discussed below 
huntington s average balance sheets and net interest margin analysis can be found on pages and huntington regularly enters into various types of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the cash flows generated by derivative instruments used to manage risk associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are recorded along with the interest from the hedged item and consequently impact the yields on those assets and liabilities 
the impact of these derivatives lowered the net interest margin by two basis points in and five basis points in  but increased the net interest margin by eight basis points in huntington s interest rate risk position as well as the implementation of a new accounting standard regarding derivatives is discussed further in the interest rate risk management section of this report 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses all at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
on a reported basis  the provision expense was million for on an operating basis  the provision for loan losses was million  up from million in and million two years ago  representing significant increases in net charge offs and deteriorating economic conditions impacting credit quality 
the operating basis results for exclude the impact of an additional fourth quarter provision for loan losses of million to increase the all ratio to of total loans  reflecting a deterioration in credit quality  and million in the second quarter  which included million for estimated increased losses resulting from huntington s decision to exit sub prime automobile and truck and equipment lending  million to charge off delinquent consumer and small business loans more than days past due  and million to increase reserves for consumer bankruptcies 
the all was million at december   up from million the end of and million at year end this represents of total loans compared with of total loans at the end of the prior two years 
the reserve ratio is expected to increase in after the sale of loans in the florida operations 
non performing loans in were covered by the all times versus times at the end of last year 
additional information regarding the all and asset quality appears in the credit risk section 
huntington allocates the all to each loan category based on an expected loss ratio determined by continuous assessment of credit quality based on portfolio risk characteristics and other relevant factors such as historical performance  internal controls  and impacts from mergers and acquisitions 
for the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate credits  expected loss factors are assigned by credit grade at the individual loan level 
the aggregation of these factors represents management s estimate of the inherent loss 
the portion of the allowance allocated to the more homogeneous consumer loan segments is determined by developing expected loss ratios based on the risk characteristics of the various segments and giving consideration to existing economic conditions and trends 
projected loss ratios incorporate factors such as trends in past due and non accrual amounts  recent loan loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics  and concentrations of various loan categories 
actual loss ratios experienced in the future  however  could vary from those projected as a loan s performance is a function of not only economic factors but also other factors unique to each customer 
the diversity in size of commercial and commercial real estate loans can be significant as well 
the dollar exposure could significantly vary from estimated amounts due to diversity 
additionally  the impact from recent economic events  including the recession and events of september   on individual customers may not yet be known 
to ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence  a portion of the all is considered unallocated 
for analytical purposes  the allocation of the all is provided below 
while amounts are allocated to various portfolio segments  the total all  excluding impairment reserves prescribed under provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio

excluding losses related to the exited businesses  commercial and consumer net charge offs were and  respectively

the higher loss levels during this origination period were the result of less rigorous underwriting standards  which were subsequently improved 
although the relative portion of the portfolios is diminishing  these loans and leases contributed to the higher losses in the recent year  along with the economic slowdown  and an increase in the average loss per vehicle due to lower used car prices 
until general economic conditions begin to improve  huntington s management expects unfavorable trends in credit quality and net charge offs to continue at or above current levels in all portfolios  particularly in the first half of the following table shows the activity in huntington s all  along with selected credit quality indicators

non interest income non interest income before gains from investment security and loan sales  was million in  compared with million for the same period last year and million in service charges on deposit accounts increased from a year ago  primarily due to higher corporate maintenance fees and  to a lesser extent  sales of cash management products 
brokerage and insurance revenue increased million  or  driven by strong growth in insurance and investment banking fees 
annuity sales reached record highs for huntington in contributing to a increase in brokerage income year over year despite a volatile equity market 
insurance related revenue was up reflecting the full year impact of a new insurance agency acquired in trust income rose as a result of increased revenue from the sales to customers of huntington s proprietary mutual funds as five new funds were added during this year and certain price increases 
mortgage banking income for was up over last year due to the refinancing activity resulting from the lower interest rate environment 
origination volume totaled billion  up from billion in the same period a year ago 
other service charges and fees increased nearly over the prior year due primarily to higher customer usage of huntington s check card product 
new revenue from the sale of interest rate derivative products to corporate customers and loan securitization activity also helped to drive other non interest income up over last year 
investment security gains totaled million for  versus million for and million for included in the net gains in the table below is a million loss realized from the sale of million of pacific gas electric commercial paper acquired from the huntington national bank s money market fund

higher personnel costs reflect increases in sales commissions related to mortgage banking  capital markets  and private financial services activities  offset by lower benefit expenses 
occupancy and equipment costs increased in due to higher depreciation and building maintenance 
other factors contributing to the increase in non interest expense  included in other  was a million impairment loss related to pg e commercial paper  and million of premium expense related to the purchase of automobile lease residual value insurance 
the million pg e impairment loss reflected in non interest expense related to activities in the huntington national bank s money market mutual fund the fund 
the fund owned million of pg e commercial paper at the end of last year 
during the first quarter of  million of the paper was sold with a million loss incurred 
although the fund could have absorbed the loss and still maintained the net asset value at per share  huntington reimbursed the fund for the million loss 
the remaining million of commercial paper was held by huntington until the economic and political ramifications of pg e s april chapter bankruptcy filing became known 
the remaining pg e commercial paper was sold in the third quarter of  as discussed above  at a loss of million  which is included in restructuring and special charges 
the combined losses amounted to million 
in late  huntington purchased residual value insurance coverage 
residual values are established at the origination of the lease and represent the estimated value of the automobiles at the end of the lease 
the insurance covers the difference between the recorded residual value and the fair market value of the automobile at the end of the lease term as evidenced by black book valuations 
the insurance provides first dollar loss coverage on the portfolio at october   and has a cap on insured losses of million 
insured losses on new lease originations from october to march  have a cap of million 
the insurance coverage is subject to annual renewal

interest rate risk and liquidity management interest rate risk management huntington seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility arising from shifts in interest rates 
the asset and liability management committee alco oversees financial risk management by establishing broad policies and specific operating limits that govern a variety of financial risks inherent in huntington s operations  including interest rate  liquidity  counterparty  settlement  and market risks 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from the adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
interest rate risk is huntington s primary market risk and results from the timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
alco regularly monitors huntington s interest rate sensitivity position to ensure consistency with approved risk tolerances 
interest rate risk management is a dynamic process  encompassing business flows onto the balance sheet  wholesale investment and funding  and the changing market and business environment 
effective management of interest rate risk begins with appropriately diversified investments and funding sources 
to accomplish its overall balance sheet objectives  huntington regularly accesses a variety of global markets money  bond  futures  and options as well as numerous trading exchanges 
in addition  dealers in over the counter financial instruments provide availability of interest rate swaps as needed 
measurement and monitoring of interest rate risk is an ongoing process 
two key elements used in this process are huntington s income simulation model and its net present value model 
the income simulation model estimates the amount that net interest income will change over a twelve to twenty four month period given adverse changes in interest rates 
the net present value model  or economic value of equity eve  is used to discern levels of risk in huntington s balance sheet that may not be determined in its income simulation model 
these two models have limitations but complement each other and together these models portray the magnitude of exposure to interest rate risk 
assumptions used in these models are inherently uncertain  but management believes that these models provide a reasonably accurate estimate of huntington s interest rate risk exposure 
management s reporting of this information is regularly shared with the board of directors 
the income simulation model used by huntington incorporates a gradual change in the shape of the forward yield curve and captures all major assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on mortgages and consumer installment loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization on revolving credit instruments  and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  eg interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships  as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
the forward yield curve at december   implied a basis point increase in short term interest rates by the end of the results of huntington s recent sensitivity analysis indicated that net interest income would be lower during the next twelve months than if interest rates were basis points higher at the end of that period than implied by forward rates at december   or basis points from rates at this same date 
net interest income was estimated to be lower if rates were basis points higher than the yield curve  or basis points overall 
conversely  if rates were and basis points lower than the yield curve  net interest income would be and higher  respectively 
these measures of the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates incorporate the effects of the sale of the florida franchise 
the sale of selected assets and liabilities in the florida region increased the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income modestly  but repositioning of the balance sheet in anticipation of the sale ensured that the resulting level remained below the management limit of 
at the end of  net interest income was estimated to be higher during the subsequent twelve months if interest rates were basis points lower than the level implied by forward rates in twelve months 
the decline in sensitivity over the past year was primarily due to the previously mentioned sales of low margin fixed rate investment securities 
these sales were part of management s effort to restructure the balance sheet and reduce sensitivity to interest rate changes in order to stabilize huntington s revenue base 
the eve simulation model used by huntington measures the level of risk in the balance sheet that might not have been accounted for in the income simulation model due to that model s limited time horizon 
the eve is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows  minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical assumptions  along with assumptions regarding the speed of loan and security prepayments and the assumed behavior of zero maturity deposits 
the sensitivity of the eve to changes in interest rates is estimated by calculating the eve under alternative interest rate scenarios 
unlike the analysis of net interest income at risk  which is based on assumed changes in interest rates over time  the eve analysis is based on assumed immediate shifts in interest rates 
in addition  the eve analysis does not reflect assumed changes to the balance sheet that would arise from new business 
at december   an immediate increase of basis points was estimated to reduce the eve by 
a basis point increase was estimated to reduce the eve by 
the eve was estimated to increase by in response to a basis point decrease in rates and decrease by in response to a basis point decrease 
these estimates reflect the characteristics of the balance sheet at december   which included selected assets and liabilities in florida that were sold in separate analysis indicates that the risk to the eve after the sale of those assets and liabilities from an immediate basis point increase in rates was close to but less than one percentage point greater than the risk for the organization including those assets and liabilities 
the difference between the sensitivity to rate increases and decreases of the same amount is a measure of the convexity of the balance sheet 
in the case of a basis point shift  for example  the balance sheet is estimated to be negatively convex  because the eve would decrease by more in response to an increase in rates than it would increase in response to a decrease in rates 
the source of the negative convexity is primarily the asymmetric prepayment rates of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in increasing and decreasing interest rate environments and the greater latitude to raise than lower some deposit rates  given the already very low level of interest rates 
active interest rate risk management necessitates the use of various types of derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors  exchange traded futures and option contracts  and forward rate agreements 
risk that is created by different indices on products  by unequal terms to maturity of assets and liabilities  and by products that are appealing to customers but incompatible with current risk limits can be eliminated or decreased in a cost efficient manner by utilizing interest rate swaps 
often  the swap strategy has enabled huntington to lower the overall cost of raising wholesale funds 
interest rate derivatives have characteristics similar to securities but possess the advantages of customization of the risks and rewards in the instrument  minimizing the balance sheet leverage and improving liquidity 
on january   huntington implemented a new accounting standard  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires recognition of derivatives at their fair value as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet 
the accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the intended use of the derivatives 
for derivatives designated as hedges of changes in the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities  gains or losses on the derivatives are recognized in earnings together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items 
this results in earnings only being impacted to the extent that the hedge is ineffective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
for derivatives used to hedge changes in cash flows associated with forecasted transactions  gains or losses on the effective portion of the derivatives are deferred  and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  a component of shareholders equity  until the period in which the hedged transactions affect earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges are recognized in current earnings 
the after tax transition adjustment for the implementation of this new standard was immaterial to net income and reduced aoci by million

alco regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the business and ensures that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events 
at the end of the recent year  management believes sufficient liquidity was available to meet estimated short term and long term funding needs 
funding is available from a number of sources  including core deposits  the investment securities portfolio  the securitization and sale of loans  and the ability to acquire large deposits and the issuance of notes and common and preferred securities in the capital markets 
one of huntington s chief sources of liquidity is derived from the large retail deposit base accessible by its network of banking offices 
certificates of deposit of  or more totaled nearly billion at december   of which million mature within three months  million mature within three to six months  million mature within six months to one year  and million mature beyond one year 
this funding is supplemented by huntington s demonstrated ability to raise funds in capital markets and to access funds nationwide 
the bank subsidiary s billion domestic bank note program as well as huntington s and its parent company s combined billion euronote program are significant sources of wholesale funding 
under these sources  unsecured senior and subordinated notes are issuable with maturities ranging from one month to thirty years 
huntington is also a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb  which provides funding through advances to its members that are collateralized with mortgage related assets that carry maturities from one month to twenty years

huntington s parent company obtains its funding from dividends  subsidiary capital activities  and from the issuance of commercial paper through huntington bancshares financial corporation  a non bank subsidiary 
the parent company accesses the capital markets through issuance of medium term notes via its million note program 
the proceeds from these sources are used from time to time to fund certain non banking activities  finance acquisitions  repurchase huntington s common stock  or for other general corporate purposes

credit risk huntington s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize in market lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations 
the credit administration function employs extensive risk management techniques  including forecasting  to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified 
these procedures provide executive management with the information necessary to implement policy adjustments where necessary  and take corrective actions on a proactive basis 
non performing assets npas consist of loans that are no longer accruing interest  loans that have been renegotiated based upon financial difficulties of the borrower  and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
commercial and real estate loans are placed on non accrual status and stop accruing interest when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or generally when the loan is days past due 
when interest accruals are suspended  accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss 
consumer loans are not placed on non accrual status  rather they are charged off in accordance with regulatory statutes  which is generally no more than days

certain industries have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to the weakening economic environment such as hotels  restaurants  amusements recreation  insurance  and airlines

given the weakened economic conditions  huntington expects that npas may increase in  particularly in the first half of the year 
this increase may be offset by reduced npas associated with the florida operations 
however  the ratio of npas to total loans is expected to increase subsequent to the sale

amounts actually collected and recorded as interest income for these loans totaled million 
capital and dividends capital is managed at each subsidiary based upon the respective risks and growth opportunities  as well as regulatory requirements 
huntington places significant emphasis on the maintenance of strong capital  which promotes investor confidence  provides access to the national markets under favorable terms  and enhances business growth and acquisition opportunities 
huntington also recognizes the importance of managing capital and continually strives to maintain an appropriate balance between capital adequacy and returns to shareholders 
shareholders equity at december   was flat year over year despite the reduced earnings due to the restructuring and special charges but was positively impacted by the reduced dividends and the appreciation in the unrealized fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio in cash dividends declared were a share in  down from a share in beginning with the dividends declared in the third quarter of this year  huntington reduced its cash dividend to shareholders by

the sale of the florida operations in early is expected to temporarily increase huntington s tangible equity to asset ratio to approximately 
this ratio is expected to decline as huntington utilizes the excess capital to repurchase its common stock 
huntington intends to maintain a minimum ratio of 
risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve board set minimum capital requirements and require institutions to calculate risk based capital ratios by assigning risk weightings to assets  to notional values of certain financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  and to off balance sheet items such as loan commitments and securitizations 
these guidelines further define well capitalized levels for financial institutions 
both huntington and its bank subsidiary had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well capitalized institutions

lines of business below is a brief description of each line of business and a discussion of the business segment results 
the financial information by line of business for the years ended december    and can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
retail banking  corporate banking  dealer sales  and the private financial group are huntington s major business lines 
a fifth segment includes the impact of huntington s treasury function and other unallocated assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense 
line of business results are determined based upon huntington s business profitability reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments 
this process is designed around huntington s organizational and management structure and  accordingly  the results are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions 
huntington s management reviews financial results on an operating basis  which excludes the impact of restructuring and special charges and the gain on sale of its credit card portfolio 
operating earnings loss for each year  by line of business  reconciled to net income for huntington was as follows in thousands of dollars retail banking    corporate banking    dealer sales    private financial group    treasury other    consolidated operating earnings  net of tax    gain on sale of credit card portfolio  net of tax  restructuring and special charges  net of tax    consolidated net income    retail banking retail banking provides products and services to retail and business banking customers 
this segment s products include home equity loans  first mortgage loans  installment loans  business loans  personal and business deposit products  as well as investment and insurance services 
these products and services are offered through huntington s traditional banking network  direct bank  and web bank 
retail banking s operating earnings  net of tax  was million in this compares with million for and million for excluding revenue and expenses related to the sale of huntington s credit card portfolio in  net income for that year was million 
the lower interest rate environment in coupled with high runoff of higher rate loans in the portfolio offset by strong deposit growth  especially in the second half of this year  pushed net interest income down nearly 
this trend in interest rates  however  positively impacted mortgage banking income by million over last year  which helped drive total non interest income up 
the refinancing activity in residential mortgage loans helped provide cross selling opportunities for this segment that resulted in high growth in home equity loans and personal lines of credit 
as noted above  credit quality continued to deteriorate and as a result  the retail banking segment experienced net charge offs for that were more than double that of a year ago  which also resulted in a significant increase in the provision for loan losses 
non interest expense increased million due to higher commissions in relation to the increased mortgage and other fee income as well as increases in other personnel related costs 
this segment contributed of huntington s operating earnings for and comprised of its total loan portfolio and of its core deposits 
corporate banking customers in this segment represent the middle market and large corporate banking relationships which use a variety of banking products and services including  but not limited to  commercial loans  international trade  and cash management 
huntington s capital markets division also provides alternative financing solutions for larger business clients  including privately placed debt  syndicated commercial lending  and the sale of interest rate protection products 
operating earnings for corporate banking was million for the recent twelve months  compared with million for the same period last year and million for increased net loan charge offs of basis points along with loan growth of contributed to an increase in the provision for loan losses of million over last year 
the segment experienced strong growth in commercial loans in the first half of but significantly less in the second half  while construction and commercial real estate loans showed consistent growth all year long 
this loan growth helped offset the negative impact of falling interest rates as net interest income increased over the prior year 
non interest income for increased from  driven by a increase in deposit account services charges  which resulted from higher demand deposit balances during the year 
also  investment banking fees were up million and letter of credit fees increased million 
a portion of this fee revenue increase was offset by lower trust income as institutional fiduciary operations were reported in to the private financial group during non interest expense increased compared with last year due to increases in outside services expense  equipment and occupancy expenses  marketing expense  and professional fees 
corporate banking contributed of huntington s operating earnings for the recent year and comprised of its total loan portfolio and of its core deposits 
dealer sales dealer sales product offerings pertain to the automobile lending sector and include indirect consumer loans and leases  as well as floor plan financing 
the consumer loans and leases comprise the vast majority of the business and involves the financing of vehicles purchased or leased by individuals through dealerships 
operating earnings for this segment were million for the twelve months ended december   versus million and million in each of the prior two annual periods 
higher bankruptcies  a softer used car market and overall economic conditions  resulted in higher net charge offs in the auto lease and indirect lending portfolios 
see huntington s discussion above of losses involved in certain origination vintages under provision and allowance for loan losses 
charge offs nearly doubled on a combined basis in versus  increasing the provision for loan losses million for however  net interest margins on these products widened year over year 
non interest income dropped as income from securitization related activities declined versus the prior year 
non interest expense included premium expense relating to policies covering auto lease residual values 
dealer sales contributed of huntington s operating earnings for and comprised of its outstanding loans 
private financial group huntington s private financial group pfg provides an array of products and services designed to meet the needs of huntington s higher wealth customers

operating earnings for this segment for the year were million  up from million and million reported for and net interest income grew million in  primarily as a result of significant loan growth over combined with wider margins on loan balances 
the loan growth was most notable in consumer loans personal credit lines and residential mortgage loans  as declining interest rates incented refinancing activity 
spreads improved as market rates declined more rapidly than effective rates 
the increase in the provision for loan losses in was the result of this loan growth 
the overall credit quality in this line of business improved during the year as charge offs actually declined from ten basis points in to nine basis points in non interest income increased in the most recent year due largely to higher insurance revenue and higher trust income primarily from huntington s proprietary mutual funds 
assets in five new funds that were introduced during the year grew to over million by the end of this year 
growth in insurance revenue  along with the increase in non interest expense  was largely reflective of the full year contribution from the j 
rolfe davis agency acquisition that occurred in late august included in non interest expense is the pg e impairment loss related to activities in the huntington national bank s money market mutual fund as discussed previously under non interest expense above 
this segment represented of huntington s annual operating earnings and of total loans 
treasury other the treasury other segment absorbs unassigned assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  and expense that cannot be directly assigned or allocated to one of huntington s lines of business 
furthermore  huntington uses a match funded transfer pricing system to allocate interest income and interest expense to its business segments 
this approach consolidates the interest rate risk management of huntington into its treasury group 
as part of its overall interest rate risk and liquidity management strategy  the treasury group administers an investment portfolio of approximately billion 
revenue and expense associated with these activities remain within the treasury group 
additionally  amortization expense of intangible assets is also a significant component of treasury other
