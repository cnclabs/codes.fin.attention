item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements  all included elsewhere herein 
the information set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
many factors  including but not limited to those discussed below under factors that may affect future results could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements 
overview flanders is a full range air filtration product company engaged in designing  manufacturing and marketing high performance air filtration products and certain related products and services 
our focus has evolved from expansion through acquisition to increasing the quality and efficiency of our high volume replacement filtration products  and using these benefits to compete more effectively in the marketplace 
we also design and manufacture much of our own production equipment as well as glass based media for many of our air filtration products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as revenues  allowances for returns  early payment discounts  customer discounts  doubtful accounts  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  insurance programs  and valuations of investments  goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventory balances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our insurance costs are developed by management evaluation of the likelihood and probable amount of potential claims based on historical experience and evaluation of each claim 
changes in the key assumptions may occur in the future  which would result in changes to related insurance costs 
we also have recorded goodwill and intangible assets related to previous acquisitions 
we assess impairments associated with these assets when we determine that the undiscounted expected future cash flows decline below their carrying value 
poor operating performance of the business activities related to goodwill  other intangible assets  or long lived assets could result in future cash flows of these assets declining below carrying values 
results of operations compared to the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for and dollar amounts in thousands 
net sales   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income loss from continuing operations   earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes   provision benefit for income taxes  earnings loss from continuing operations  loss from discontinued operations  net earnings loss  net sales net sales for decreased by  or  to  from  for the decrease in net sales was due to a large and unexpected drop off in orders in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in revenues approximately million lower than the fourth quarter of  primarily in our replacement business for standard industrial and residential replacement filters  caused by a deferral of standard hvac system maintenance by a large number of end users 
the shortfall does not appear to be caused by a loss of market share or loss of any significant number of customers 
gross profit 
gross profit for increased  or  to  which made up of net sales  from  for  which made up of net sales 
excluding approximately million of one time charges booked to cost of sales in  consisting primarily of decreases in inventory valuations  increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts  and other charges for write offs of previously capitalized costs and other miscellaneous items  gross profit for decreased by  approximately million of which was due to the unexpected revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter of the remainder of the decrease in gross profit was principally attributable to o expanded facilities in tijuana  which were brought partially online during the first half of the year  experienced additional expenses associated with completing expansions  reorganizing production schedules  hiring and training additional laborers  and other inefficiencies typical of expanded manufacturing operations  including duplicate staffing at our san diego and nevada facilities 
o increased price competition for several major retail accounts 
o increased inbound freight costs for raw materials associated with fuel price increases and fuel surcharges 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for decreased  or  to  from  in the decrease in operating expenses in was primarily attributable to reductions in administrative headcount of approximately  and a salary reduction instituted in the third quarter of nonoperating income expense from continuing operations nonoperating expenses from continuing operations decreased approximately  to a net expense of approximately  for  compared to net expense of  in excluding a one time charge in for the settlement of outstanding litigation with intel of  nonoperating income expense from continuing operations decreased approximately  provision for taxes our effective state and federal tax rate  adjusted for the effect of nondeductible expenses consisting primarily of amortization of goodwill of approximately  per year  was approximately and for and  respectively 
earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from continuing operations for increased  to income of  or per share  from a loss of  or per share for the increase in earnings is primarily attributable to the benefits of administrative savings and reductions in salary expenses in compared to the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for and dollar amounts in thousands 
net sales   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income loss from continuing operations   earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes   provision benefit for income taxes   earnings loss from continuing operations   loss from discontinued operations   net earnings loss   net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  from  for the increase in net sales was due to the company s success in capturing additional market share  which was achieved mainly through i attracting work from new customers through offering superior pricing and service programs  ii securing additional business from existing customers in expanded geographical regions  and iii the development and placement of new lines of filtration products with new customers for end users in new industries 
other charges and special items during the last half of  we formalized our plan to consolidate our west coast operations  and recorded other charges and special items totaling approximately  in connection with settling our outstanding litigation with intel  consolidating operations  combining organizations  plant start up expenses and for other nonrecurring items arising during the period 
these expenses were booked as approximately  in cost of goods sold   in operating expenses and  in other expenses 
amounts booked for settlement of the intel litigation included repurchasing inventory at a loss and cash payments see legal proceedings 
other one time charges included costs for inventory adjustments  write offs  plant start up expenses  duplicate assets and other miscellaneous items 
gross profit 
gross profit for decreased  or  to  which made up of net sales  from  for  which made up of net sales 
excluding the one time charges noted above  gross profit for would have increased by  or  to  which represented of net sales  compared to  which represented of net sales for the decrease in gross profit percentage  excluding one time charges for comparability between periods  was principally attributable to o delays in implementing our price increases associated with delays in the production of marketing materials and associated reorganized and consolidated marketing efforts 
anticipated benefits from this reorganization  the first stage of which was completed in mid september  were not completed in time to have a material beneficial impact on our results 
o an increase in the percentage of our labor force employed through temporary services compared to  caused by the continued tightness in the labor pool of qualified seasonal workers  which increased average labor costs per hour during the period and resulted in a net increase in comparable expenses of approximately  o price concessions made to secure new contracts with distributors for mid range industrial end users led to a decrease in average selling price to industrial distributors of approximately 
o expanded facilities in salt lake city  utah and tijuana  mexico  which were brought partially online during  experienced additional expenses associated with completing expansions  reorganizing production schedules  hiring and training additional laborers  and other inefficiencies typical of reorganized and expanded manufacturing operations 
o fuel surcharges for inbound shipments of raw materials  which were attributable to a general increase in domestic diesel fuel costs caused by escalating political instability in the middle east as well as opec supply constraints 
o during and  we received national contracts from major retailers which required our first exposure to new point of sale distribution requirements 
the contracts had pricing predicated upon certain erroneous assumptions regarding the costs of these distribution methods  and these problems were exacerbated by increases in fuel and related shipping expenses 
o labor overruns and redundant personnel 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased  or  to  compared to  in excluding one time charges  operating expenses for would have increased  or  to  which represented of net sales  from  which represented of net sales in the increase in operating expenses  excluding one time charges  was principally attributable to o fuel surcharges on outbound shipments of finished goods to customers and other shipping cost increases primarily attributable to a sharp increase in diesel fuel costs amounted to approximately  o a reevaluation of accounts receivable reserves due to economic downturn and an increase in the number of potentially bad receivables caused bad debt expense in to be approximately  higher in than in  an increase of approximately 
o other increases in operating expenses were held to  with increases in sales commissions  outbound freight and other expenses directly related to sales volume balanced by reductions in redundant administrative staff  consolidation of positions between subsidiaries and other savings from our ongoing consolidation and cost reduction program 
nonoperating income expense from continuing operations net nonoperating income expense from continuing operations decreased approximately  to an expense of approximately  for  from income of  in excluding the one time charge for the settlement of our outstanding litigation with intel of  nonoperating income expense from continuing operations decreased approximately  which consisted primarily of an increase in interest expense of  caused by higher average balances on the company s credit facilities and a higher average interest rate on the company s lines of credit  which have variable rates linked to standard interest rate indices 
discontinued operations in december  the company adopted a formal plan to close airseal west  a wholly owned subsidiary  and sell its various assets and product lines to unrelated third parties 
the closure was completed in the first quarter of  although various assets  consisting primarily of non filtration inventories  manufacturing equipment  designs and intellectual properties  were not sold until later in the year 
the estimated net loss of the discontinued operations of approximately  and  in and  respectively  consists of net losses from discontinued operations of  and  respectively  approximately  of estimated losses on the disposal of assets which were accrued in  and an additional  of estimated losses on the disposal of assets accrued in provision for taxes our blended state and federal tax rate  excluding the effect of nondeductible expenses consisting primarily of amortization of goodwill of approximately  per year and approximately  of one time adjustments in  was approximately for both and earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from continuing operations for decreased  or  to a loss of  or per share  from  or per share basic diluted for the decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to one time charges and decreases in gross profit percentage discussed above 
effects of inflation the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was  at december   compared to  at december  this included cash and cash equivalents of  and  at december  and  respectively 
trade receivables decreased  or  to  at december  from  at december  the decrease in receivables is primarily due to the decreased volume of net sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of and timing differences in shipments and payments received 
continuing operations generated  of cash in  compared to consuming  of cash in the difference in cash flows was primarily related to the difference in net earnings from continuing operations 
investing activities for continuing operations consumed  of cash during  compared to  consumed during  consisting primarily of the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
financing activities for continuing operations provided  of cash in  compared to  of cash in  primarily from advances on our revolving credit facility 
we currently have a million working capital credit facility from two banks  amended effective april  as of december   we had used approximately million of the million working capital facility 
the working capital credit facility bears interest at libor  which was at december   plus 
at times during and  including at december   the company was in violation of certain of financial loan covenants 
the amendment extends the current credit facility and modifies required financial ratios  other loan covenants  and waives prior loan covenant violations 
the agreement to amend and extend the working capital credit facility calls for the facility to expire august   and is subject to documentation acceptable to both the banks and the company 
the working capital credit facility is collateralized by the pledge of all common stock of the subsidiaries owned by the company and other assets of the company 
in connection with the amended working capital credit facility and notes payable to a regional development authority and bank  the company has agreed to certain restrictive covenants which include  among other things  not paying dividends  not repurchasing its stock  and maintenance of certain financial ratios at all times including a minimum current ratio  minimum tangible net worth  a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
unless this credit facility is renewed  it will expire in august failure to negotiate an extension to this credit facility  enter into a replacement facility  or obtain additional equity will materially adversely impact our business and operations 
continuing expansion may require substantial capital investment for the manufacture of filtration products 
although we have been able to arrange debt facilities or equity financing to date  there can be no assurance that sufficient debt financing or equity will continue to be available in the future  or that it will be available on acceptable terms 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely impact our growth strategy 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock  which repurchase was completed in september on september   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional two million shares of common stock through open market or negotiated transactions 
further repurchases under this program are restricted under our current line of credit agreement 
as of april   approximately  shares had been repurchased in the open market under this authorization 
outlook we recently announced that we had adapted our biocontainment products for use as part of a system for hardening government buildings  commercial office complexes and public venues against airborne bioweapons such as anthrax and smallpox 
there is currently a tremendous amount of interest in these products  and major market analysts have indicated this will continue  but we do not know how reliable this expectation is  whether this interest will be sustained for a long period of time  or whether this interest will actually produce significant sales of these products 
any significant trend towards requiring hardening these types of facilities against airborne bioweapons could have a significant impact on our business 
during the third quarter of  base wages at all operating facilities and departments  including corporate headquarters  were reduced by  with base wages restored to previous levels on a month to month basis if specific month to month performance goals are met at the individual facilities 
the majority of our facilities and operating groups have had their wages restored for at least some of the months this program has been in place 
we are currently introducing new products for the retail marketplace  our airia indoor air cleaners and wholehouse residential air cleaning systems 
in contrast to our standard retail filters  the bulk of which sell for unit prices between and  these new products will sell for substantially more between and  with replacement packs ranging from mo 
to mo 
these are new products which are substantially different in features  appearance and performance from competing products  and we have no actual market data on how successful they will be  and hence have no way of estimating their impact on the financial results of the company 
any sales of these units in significant quantities will require additional financial resources  either through equity or debt financing  to finance working capital requirements for production and sale of these products 
for example  placement of an initial stocking order of the lowest priced unit by a national retailer with  locations would result in new sales in excess of million  with commensurate working capital requirements 
at this point  we cannot estimate when or how much working capital may be required to finance these new products 
sales of air filtration products for semiconductor facilities  historically a major market  are expected to be slow again during  with most analysts pushing recovery for this sector out to at least the current weak economy is also expected to have a dampening effect on sales of air filtration products across all product lines and end user categories 
as long as the current weakness in the economy continues  in individual market segments or the marketplace as a whole  our results will be negatively affected 
we have collected data that indicates that residential filter users replace their filters  on average  approximately once per year 
manufacturers of residential furnace and air conditioning systems recommend that these filters be changed every month 
a minor trend toward increased maintenance of these residential heating and cooling systems could have a positive impact on our business 
our most common products  in terms of both unit and dollar volume  are residential throw away spun glass filters  which usually sell for prices under 
any increase in consumer concern regarding air pollution  airborne pollens  allergens  and other residential airborne contaminants could result in replacement of some of these products with higher value products 
our higher value products include our naturalaire higher efficiency filters for residential use  with associated sales prices typically over each 
any such trend would have a beneficial effect on our business 
if our residential air cleaners are successful  we believe replacement filter sales  and the increased awareness of indoor air quality engendered by the simple presence of the air cleaners  will help to create and or accelerate this trend 
we believe there is currently a gradually increasing public awareness of the issues surrounding indoor air quality and that this trend will continue for the next several years 
we also believe there is an increase in public concern regarding the effects of indoor air quality on employee productivity  as well as an increase in interest by standards making bodies in creating specifications and techniques for detecting  defining and solving indoor air quality problems 
we further believe there will be an increase in interest in our absolute isolation barriers in the future because these products may be used in both semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants to prevent cross contamination between different lots and different processes being performed at the same facility 
these products also increase production yields in many applications 
currently  the largest domestic market for air filtration products is for mid range ashrae rated products and hvac systems  typically used in commercial and industrial buildings 
to date  our penetration of this market has been relatively small 
we believe our ability to offer a one stop supply of air filtration products to hvac distributors and wholesalers may increase our share of this market 
we also believe that our recently developed modular air handlers and environmental tobacco smoke systems will enable us to expand sales to these customers 
we intend our new products to serve as high profile entrants with distributors and manufacturers representatives  who can then be motivated to carry our complete product line 
this outlook section  and other portions of this document  include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  among others  those statements preceded by  following or including the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate or similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the current expectations of management and are subject to a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include those discussed below under the heading factors that may affect future results as well as o the shortage of reliable market data regarding the air filtration market  o changes in external competitive market factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  o anticipated working capital or other cash requirements  o changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the market  o product obsolescence due to the development of new technologies  and o various competitive factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k will in fact occur 
factors that may affect future results failure to manage future growth could adversely impact our business due to the strain on our management  financial and other resources if our business continues to grow  the additional growth will place burdens on management to manage such growth while maintaining profitability 
we have no guarantee that we will be able to do so 
due to our recent acquisitions and expansions  our net sales increased by approximately from through  a compound annual growth rate of 
we may not continue to expand at this rate 
our ability to compete effectively and manage future growth depends on our ability to o recruit  train and manage our work force  particularly in the areas of corporate management  accounting  research and development and operations  o manage production and inventory levels to meet product demand  o manage and improve production quality  o expand both the range of customers and the geographic scope of our customer base  and o improve financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any delay in procuring financing for new products or failure to adequately ramp up production capacity to meet demand could adversely impact our business due to strain on financial resources 
during we plan to introduce and mass market products which  if successful  will require large amounts of additional financing and or capital 
this financing may need to be available on short notice 
any failure to obtain such financing  or delay in financing  could cause the failure of the new products due to inability to deliver on time  and could adversely impact relationships with current major accounts 
in addition  delays in an untried supply chain  new production chains  and other delays common to the launch of a new product line could also adversely impact the success of the products  as well as current relationships with major accounts 
failure to negotiate appropriate loan extensions or obtain alternate financing on beneficial terms could negatively impact our business and shareholders our million operating capital line expires in august if our current and ongoing attempts to obtain extensions from our banks or refinancing from other parties are unsuccessful  and we are unable to obtain alternate financing on beneficial terms  we could be forced to obtain financing or raise equity under terms which would not be favorable to us in order to continue to operate our business  which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations or lead to significant dilution to our existing shareholders 
our business may suffer if our competitive strategy is not successful our continued success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive 
this competition may increase as new competitors enter the market 
several of these competitors may have longer operating histories and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
additionally  our competitors may introduce new products or enhancements to products that could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products 
under our current competitive strategy  we endeavor to remain competitive by o increasing our market share  o expanding our market through the introduction of new products which require periodic replacement  and o improving operating efficiencies 
although our executive management team continues to review and monitor our strategic plans  we have no assurance that we will be able to follow our current strategy or that this strategy will be successful 
our market share may not continue to increase if we are unable to acquire additional synergistic businesses in the past several years we have significantly increased our market share by acquiring synergistic businesses 
although we intend to continue to increase our market share in this manner  we have no assurance that future acquisition opportunities will be available 
additionally  in the future we may not have access to the substantial debt or equity financing to finance potential acquisitions 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and other acquisition related expenses  all of which could adversely affect our profitability or cash flows 
our strategy of growth through acquisition also exposes us to the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
we do not currently have any binding agreements with respect to future acquisitions 
our business may suffer if our strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market is unsuccessful we are developing new products as part of our strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market 
we have no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
we have no guarantee that any new products we develop will gain acceptance in the marketplace  or that these products will be successful 
additionally  we have no assurance we will be able to recoup the expenditures associated with the development of these products 
to succeed in this area we must o increase public awareness of the issues surrounding indoor air quality  o adequately address the unknown requirements of the potential customer base  o develop new products that are competitive in terms of price  performance and quality  and o avoid significant increases in current expenditure levels in development  marketing and consumer education 
we may experience critical equipment failure which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we experience extended periods of downtime due to the malfunction or failure of our automated production equipment  our business  financial condition and operations may suffer 
we design and manufacture much of the automated production equipment used in our facilities 
we also use other technologically advanced equipment for which manufacturers may have limited production capability or service experience 
if we are unable to quickly repair our equipment or quickly obtain new equipment or parts from outside manufacturers  we could experience extended periods of downtime in the event of malfunction or equipment failure 
if automation of our production lines fails to produce the projected results  our business will suffer we have only recently substantially completed a program to increase our gross margins by automating portions of our production lines 
although the designs have been extensively tested in the field  we have no assurance that the new equipment will produce the expected beneficial results on our gross margins 
additionally  we are not certain that any increases in efficiencies will not be offset in the marketplace by competitors making similar improvements to their facilities 
our plan to centralize overhead functions may not produce the anticipated benefits to our operating results we are currently completing the implementation of plans to centralize and eliminate duplication of efforts between our subsidiaries in the following areas o purchasing  o production planning  o shipping coordination  o marketing  o accounting  o personnel management  o risk management  and o benefit plan administration 
we have no assurance that cutting overhead in this fashion will have the anticipated benefits to our operating results 
additionally  we have no assurance that these reorganizations will not significantly disrupt the operations of the affected subsidiaries 
our success depends on our ability to retain and attract key personnel our success and future operating results depend in part upon our ability to retain our executives and key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
our success also depends on our ability to attract highly qualified engineering  manufacturing  technical  sales and support personnel for our operations 
competition for such personnel  particularly qualified engineers  is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
our failure to attract or retain such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current distribution channels may be unavailable if our manufacturers representatives decide to work primarily with one of our competitors we provide our manufacturers representatives with the ability to offer a full product line of air filtration products to existing and new customers 
some of our competitors offer similar arrangements 
we do not have exclusive relationships with most of our representatives 
consequently  if our representatives decide to work primarily with one of our competitors  our current distribution channels  and hence  our sales  could be significantly reduced 
management controls a significant percentage of our stock as of april   our directors and executive officers beneficially held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  such shareholders effectively control or significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval 
these matters include the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
we may be required to issue stock in the future that will dilute the value of our existing stock if we issue the following securities  such securities may dilute the value of the securities that our existing stockholders now hold 
we have granted warrants to purchase a total of  of our shares of common stock to various parties with exercise prices ranging from to per share 
all of the warrants are currently exercisable 
as a result  if the warrant holders exercise these warrants  the interests of current shareholders may be diluted 
we have granted options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock to various parties with exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the majority of these options are currently exercisable 
additionally  if the option holders exercise their options  the interests of current shareholders may be diluted 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of our charter provisions and north carolina law our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that are designed to provide our board of directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders 
these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control in our business 
additionally  we are subject to the control shares acquisition act of the state of north carolina 
this act provides that any person who acquires control shares of a publicly held north carolina corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation vote to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would typically provide 
our business can be significantly affected by environmental laws the constantly changing body of environmental laws and regulations may significantly influence our business and products 
these laws and regulations require that various environmental standards be met and impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards 
while we endeavor at each of our facilities to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and are currently not aware of any ongoing issues of this nature  we cannot be certain that our operations or activities  or historical operations by others at our locations  will not result in civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we have  in the past  and may  in the future  purchase or lease properties with unresolved potential violations of federal or state environmental regulations 
in these transactions  we have been successful in obtaining sufficient indemnification and mitigating the impact of the issues without recognizing significant expenses associated with litigation and cleanup 
however  purchasing or leasing these properties requires us to weigh the cost of resolving these issues and the likelihood of litigation against the potential economic and business benefits of the transaction 
if we fail to correctly identify  resolve and obtain indemnification against these risks  they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse change in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for flanders  these exposures are primarily related to the sale of product to foreign customers and changes in interest rates 
we do not have any derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt  including capital leases  at december  was approximately  market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at december  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to a market rate  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
we have only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
we have two interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates of two variable rate bonds 
under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive or make payments on a monthly basis  based on the differential between and a tax exempt interest rate as determined by a remarketing agent 
this interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas and sfas gains or losses related to inefficiencies of the cash flow hedge were included in net income during the period related to hedge ineffectiveness 
the tax effected fair market value of the interest rate swap of  is included in other comprehensive income 
the interest rate swap contracts expire in and the company s financial position is not materially affected by fluctuations in currencies against the us dollar  since assets held outside the united states are negligible 
risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are negligible  as the preponderance of our foreign sales occur over short periods of time or are demarcated in us dollars
