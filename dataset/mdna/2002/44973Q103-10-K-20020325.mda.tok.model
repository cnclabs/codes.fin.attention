service revenues accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in software license revenues are attributable to the addition of new customers  and the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products and license renewals 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition and sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain arrangements 
we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
we sell software  professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
in multiple element arrangements  we allocate the total fee to professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the fair value of those elements  which is defined as the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
the residual amount is then allocated to the software license fee 
we recognize software license fees upon execution of a signed license agreement and delivery of the software  provided there are no significant post delivery obligations  the payment is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in cases where significant post delivery obligations exist  such as customization or enhancements to the core software  we recognize the entire fee on a percentage of completion basis  and include the entire fee in product revenues 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
we provide for sales returns at the time of revenue recognition based on historical experience 
to date  such returns have not been significant 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
professional service revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and using the percentage of completion method for fixed fee contracts 
if conditions for acceptance exist  professional service revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance

training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is generally twelve months 
when maintenance and support is included in the total license fee  we allocate a portion of the total fee to maintenance and support based upon the price paid by the customer to purchase maintenance and support in the second year 
payments received from customers at the inception of a maintenance period are treated as deferred service revenues and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
payments received from customers in advance of product shipment or revenue recognition are treated as unearned product revenues and recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or when earned 
substantially all of the amounts included in cost of revenues represent direct costs related to the delivery of professional services  training and maintenance and customer support 
to date  cost of product revenues have not been significant 
we assess the realizability of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
we review our long lived assets for impairment as events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable

research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model

as such  all software development costs incurred to date have been expensed as incurred 
we account for internal use software  in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
in accordance with this statement  costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and costs incurred for data conversion  training and maintenance are expensed as incurred

sfas no 
 disclosure of information about financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and financial instruments with concentrations of credit risk  requires disclosure of any significant off balance sheet risk and concentrations of credit risk 
we do not have any significant off balance sheet risk 
financial instruments that potentially expose the company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
concentration of credit risk with respect to cash equivalents is limited because we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales 
to reduce risk  we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and  as a consequence  believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited 
we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses but historically have not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area 
in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  basic and diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average basic and diluted number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding excludes unvested restricted common stock that is subject to repurchase by the company 
for periods in which a net loss has been incurred  the calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common stock  as their effect is antidilutive 
potential common stock includes i incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants calculated using the treasury stock method  ii shares of common stock issuable upon the exchange or conversion of preferred stock and convertible debt calculated using the as if converted method  and iii unvested restricted common stock subject to repurchase by the company

our operating expenses excluding restructuring charges and acquisition related amortization and write offs have increased significantly since  from million for the months ended december  to million for the months ended december  these increases are primarily due to additions to our staff  including through acquisitions  as we have expanded all aspects of our operations 
we have grown from employees as of december  to employees at december  recent events in the quarter ended december   we recorded a million charge in connection with a restructuring of our operations and the impairment in value of goodwill related to our acquisition of intersoft international  inc intersoft

on february   we completed a private placement with investors the purchasers  pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement among us and the purchasers the purchase agreement 
the private placement was exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to section of such act 
the terms of this private placement were reported on a form k  which we filed with the securities and exchange commission of february  at the closing  we issued  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  aggregating  and  shares of a newly designated series of preferred stock  at a purchase price of  per share 
the preferred stock has no dividends or coupon  no liquidation preference and no financial covenants 
the preferred stock will be convertible into common stock at a price equal to the higher of or of the average price of our stock measured over a period following the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the resale of the shares  which we will file with the securities and exchange commission on or before march  we have the right to establish a new floor for the conversion price  which will serve as the minimum conversion price 
subject to the establishment of a new floor price  the conversion price of the preferred stock also will not exceed or of the average price of our common stock measured over a period following the effectiveness of the registration statement  whichever is greater 
the shares of preferred stock may be converted into common stock at the option of the holder during the five trading day period commencing on the later to occur of business days after the closing date and trading days after the effective date of the registration statement covering the resale of the shares 
we may require the conversion of such shares into common stock during the same five day period if the floor price established by us is less than the applicable conversion price 
in the event that the preferred stock is not converted into common stock by the date set for conversion  the shares of preferred stock will be redeemed by us 
pending conversion or redemption of the shares of preferred stock  the proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock are being held in escrow 
we intend to use the proceeds from the private placement for working capital and other general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions of  or investments in  one or more new technologies  products or businesses 
in addition  we granted the investors certain common stock purchase warrants  consisting of i warrants exercisable for days after the closing to purchase up to an additional aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  ii seven year warrants to purchase up to an additional aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  and iii seven year warrants to purchase a number of additional shares of common stock equal to of the shares of common stock received on conversion of the preferred stock  at an exercise price equal to of the conversion price 
the exercise price of the seven year warrants is subject to downward adjustment on a weighted average basis in the event we issue additional shares of common stock  or instruments convertible or exercisable for common stock  at an effective price less than the then applicable exercise price 
this adjustment does not apply  however  to the issuance of common stock or such instruments in underwritten public offerings  strategic transactions or pursuant to equity incentive plans 
the warrants described in clause iii of this paragraph will become void if we redeem the preferred stock 
on march   we acquired substantially all the assets of netreturn  llc  a connecticut limited liability company located in fairfield  connecticut  for a purchase price of up to million

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and consisted primarily of proceeds from the initial public offering 
at december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
due to the uncertainty related to the realization of such benefits  we have placed a full valuation allowance against this otherwise recognizable deferred tax asset 
we currently anticipate our cash and cash equivalents as of december   together with the proceeds of the february private placement  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and possible acquisitions for at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  acquisitions  the timing of expanded product and service offerings and the success of these offerings once they are launched 
accordingly  any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our available funds and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity needs  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise funds  and those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
in connection with such a sale of stock  our stockholders may experience dilution 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all

 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement provides guidance on recognizing and measuring impairment for long lived assets excluding certain long lived assets  such as goodwill  non amortized intangible assets and deferred tax assets 
this statement is effective for the company in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending december management is currently evaluating the impact that this statement will have on the company s financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we have incurred substantial losses in recent years and our return to profitability is uncertain we incurred net losses of approximately million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december   and we had an accumulated deficit at december  of million 
we expect to continue spending significantly  principally for sales  marketing and development expenses  and therefore we will need to grow our revenues significantly before we reach profitability 
in addition  our second quarter results were impacted by a number of factors that deferred purchases from us  and we cannot assure you that we will not be affected by these factors in future periods 
although we have been profitable in certain years  we cannot assure you that we will achieve sufficient revenues to become profitable in the future 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses either increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in light of lower than expected revenue  we may not be profitable 
it is difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and we often incur significant selling expenses in advance of our recognition of any related revenue our clients view the purchase of our software applications and related professional services as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  clients carefully evaluate our software products and services 
the length of this evaluation process is affected by factors such as the client s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the client is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the license of our software products may also be subject to delays if the client has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes which are quite common in the context of introducing large enterprise wide tools 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a client s evaluation period  including the costs of developing a full proposal and completing a rapid proof of concept or custom demonstration  before the client places an order with us 
clients may also initially purchase a limited number of licenses before expanding their implementations 
larger clients may purchase our software products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our license revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a significant client for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed  as occurred in our second quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues during that quarter 
this may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the value of our common stock to decline 
we have two management locations and other facilities and as we continue to grow we may experience difficulties in operating from these facilities certain members of our management team are based at our corporate headquarters located in portland  maine  and other members of our management team are based at our sales office in edison  new jersey 
in addition  as a result of our acquisitions  we have added additional facilities  including offices in chicago  illinois  fairfield  connecticut and london  united kingdom 
the geographic distance between these offices could make it difficult for our management and other employees to effectively communicate with each other and  as a result  could place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
our total revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   and the number of our employees increased from as of december  to as of december  if we continue to grow  we will need to recruit  train and retain a significant number of employees  particularly employees with technical  marketing and sales backgrounds 
because these individuals are in high demand  we may not be able to attract the staff we need to accommodate our expansion 
we are highly dependent upon the healthcare industry  and factors that adversely affect that market could also adversely affect us most of our revenue to date has come from pharmaceutical companies and a limited number of other clients in the healthcare industry  and our future growth depends  in large part  upon increased sales to the healthcare market 
in  one customer  in the healthcare market  accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues 
as a result  demand for our solutions could be affected by any factors that could adversely affect the demand for healthcare products  which are purchased and sold pursuant to contracts managed through our solutions 
the financial condition of our clients and their willingness to pay for our solutions are affected by factors that may impact the purchase and sale of healthcare products  including competitive pressures  decreasing operating margins within the industry  currency fluctuations  active geographic expansion and government regulation 
the healthcare market is undergoing intense consolidation 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience declines in revenue caused by mergers or consolidations among our clients and potential clients 
our efforts to target markets other than the healthcare market may divert resources and management attention away from our core competencies in connection with our efforts to expand into other markets  it may be necessary for us to hire additional personnel with expertise in these other industries 
we may also have to divert funds  talent  management attention and other resources toward markets that have not traditionally been the primary source of our revenues 
the risks of such diversification include the possibility that we will not be successful in generating the revenue we expect from these markets and the possible detrimental effect of diverting resources from our traditional markets 
we may not be successful in acquiring new technologies or businesses and this could hinder our expansion efforts we intend in the future to consider additional acquisitions of or new investments in complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition or investment candidates 
even if we do identify suitable candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and the issuance of debt could limit our available cash and accordingly restrict our activities 
we have made several acquisitions and may make additional acquisitions and we may have difficulty integrating them we have acquired chicor  intersoft  bcl vision ltd 
now i many international limited  and provato  which are or were located in chicago  illinois  cleveland  ohio  london  uk and oakland  california  respectively  and we are likely to make additional acquisitions 
any company that we acquire is likely to be distant from our headquarters in portland  maine and will have a culture different from ours as well as technologies  products and services that our employees will need to understand and integrate with our own 
we are continuing to assimilate the employees  technologies and products of the companies that we have acquired and will need to do the same with any new companies we may acquire  and that effort has been  and will likely continue to be difficult  time consuming and may be unsuccessful 
if we are not successful  our investment in the acquired entity may be lost  and even if we are successful  the process of integrating an acquired entity may divert our attention from our core business 
if we do acquire new technologies or businesses  our results of operations may be adversely affected in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded substantial goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  we recorded charges for write offs of a portion of the purchase prices of acquired companies as in process research and development 
although the amortization of goodwill will be discontinued pursuant to the recent issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of any intangible assets will need to be reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis 
we cannot assure you that future write downs of any such assets will not affect future operating results 
our fixed costs have led  and may continue to lead  to fluctuations in operating results which has resulted  and could in the future result  in a decline of our stock price a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly rent  are fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
in addition  our personnel costs  while variable over the long term  include commitments such as executive severance and similar expectations for other employees 
thus  we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in revenues 
accordingly  shortfalls in revenues  as we experienced in the second quarter of fiscal  may cause significant variations in operating results in any quarter 
if our quarterly results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  our stock price is likely to decline 
we have many competitors and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively the market for our products and services is competitive and subject to rapid change 
we encounter significant competition for the sale of our contract management software from the internal information systems departments of existing and potential clients  software companies that target the contract management markets  professional services organizations and internet based merchants offering healthcare and other products through online catalogs 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of products and services offered 
we anticipate increased competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and margins 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees and strategic partners 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop products or services that are equal or superior to our solutions or that achieve greater market acceptance than our solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not require us to make concessions that will adversely affect our revenues and our margins  or reduce the demand for our products and services 
our efforts to target markets other than the healthcare market for our cars products have not yet resulted in significant revenue  and we cannot be sure that our initiatives in these other markets will be successful as part of our growth strategy  we have acquired companies that target markets other than the healthcare market and have begun initiatives to sell our cars software suite of products and services in markets other than the healthcare market  including the consumer packaged goods  foodservice and other industries 
while we believe that the contractual purchase relationships between manufacturers and customers in these markets have similar attributes to those in the healthcare market  we cannot assure you that our assumptions are correct or that we will be successful in adapting our technology to these other markets 
although we have entered into strategic relationships with procter gamble and accenture  we do not yet know how rapidly or successfully our purchase contract management software solutions will be implemented in the commercial products and other industries 
we rely significantly upon certain key individuals and our business will suffer if we are unable to retain them we depend on the services of our senior management and key technical personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of a 
leigh powell  our chief executive officer  and other key employees 
the loss of the services of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
current economic conditions may weaken our sales current world economic and political conditions  including the effects of the september  terrorist attacks and the resulting military conflict  may reduce the willingness of our customers and prospective customers to commit funds to purchase our products and services 
the resulting loss or delay in our sales could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
