management does not believe that the results of operations for the transition period are indicative of future results 
therefore  the results of operations for the transition period are not comparable to other presented periods 
the results for fiscal are not comparable to the other periods presented  due to the inclusion of oshman s results of operations  since june   the date of acquisition 
the results for fiscal  although it includes a fifty third week of operations  and fiscal years and are considered comparable to each other  but these results are not comparable to the transition period ended january  or fiscal  which represent the results of gart sports only  before the acquisition of sportmart or oshman s

ebitda is earnings loss before income taxes plus interest expense and other financing costs and depreciation and amortization 
gart sports believes that  in addition to net income loss  ebitda is a useful financial performance measure for assessing operating performance as it provides an additional basis to evaluate the ability of gart sports to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures 
in evaluating ebitda  gart sports believes that consideration should be given  among other things  to the amount by which ebitda exceeds interest costs for the period  how ebitda compares to principal repayments on debt for the period and how ebitda compares to capital expenditures for the period 
to evaluate ebitda  the components of ebitda such as revenue and operating expenses and the variability of such components over time should also be considered 
ebitda should not be construed  however  as an alternative to operating income loss as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as an indicator of gart sports operating performance or as a measure of liquidity 
gart sports method of calculating ebitda may differ from methods used by other companies  and as a result  ebitda measures disclosed herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies

the company is the second largest full line sporting goods retailer in united states and the leading full line sporting goods retailer in the western united states 
given the economic characteristics of the store formats  the similar nature of the products sold  the type of customer and method of distribution  the operations of the company are aggregated in one reportable segment

the oshman s stores will be included in the comparable store sales base beginning august   the beginning of the th full month of operations since the date of acquisition by the company 
inventories are stated at the lower of lifo cost or market 
the company considers cost of goods sold to include the direct cost of merchandise  plus certain costs associated with procurement  warehousing  handling and distribution 
in addition to the full cost of inventory  cost of goods sold includes related occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment 
operating expenses include controllable and non controllable store expenses except occupancy  non store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  the recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the store closing reserve  and the estimates used to record purchase accounting related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of the company s significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value last in  first out lifo inventory method 
the company s dollar value lifo pools are computed using the inventory price index computation epic method 
historically  we have rarely experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes  such as changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns could cause the company s inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
impairment of assets the company reviews long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long lived tangible and intangible assets are impaired 
store closing reserve the company records a provision for store closing when the decision to close a store is made 
the provision consists of the incremental costs which are expected to be incurred after the store closing  including settlement of future net lease obligations  utilities and property taxes  and other expenses directly related to the store closing 
acquisitions accounting the company s acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
the determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions which could require adjustment in the future 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods

cash flow analysis dollars in thousands  except ratios fiscal fiscal fiscal cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities capital expenditures long term debt at end of period working capital at end of period current ratio at end of period long term debt to equity ratio at end of period cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  and increases in accounts payable offset by inventory purchases 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily for the acquisition of oshman s and capital expenditures 
these uses were partially offset by cash received from the sale of the assets held for sale and the sale of an oshman s store location 
the capital expenditures were primarily for store remodeling  store fixtures  and the purchase or enhancement of certain information systems 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal primarily represents net proceeds from borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit and proceeds from the sale of common stock issued upon the exercise of stock options  offset by payments for the purchase of treasury stock 
the company s liquidity and capital needs have been met by cash from operations and borrowings under a revolving line of credit the credit agreement with cit business credit  inc  as agent cit

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
there was million outstanding under the credit agreement at march   and million was available for borrowing 
the increase in long term debt since fiscal year end is primarily attributable to seasonal inventory purchases and decreases in accounts payable 
the internal revenue service has proposed adjustments to the and consolidated federal income tax returns of the company and its former parent  now thrifty payless holdings  inc  a subsidiary of riteaid corporation  due to the manner in which lifo inventories were characterized on such returns 
based on management s discussion with the company s former parent  the company believes the potential accelerated tax liability  which could have a negative effect on liquidity in the near term  ranges from approximately to  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures are projected to be approximately to million in fiscal these capital expenditures will be primarily for new store openings  store remodeling  store fixtures  information systems  and distribution center facilities 
the company leases all of its store locations and intends to continue to finance its new stores with long term operating leases 
based upon historical data  newly constructed superstores require a cash investment of approximately million for a  square foot store and million for a  square foot store 
superstores constructed in existing retail space historically have required additional capital investments of approximately  in leasehold improvements per location 
the level of capital improvements will be affected by the mix of new construction versus renovation of existing retail space 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  combined with funds available under the credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures and other working capital requirements through fiscal the company intends to utilize the credit agreement to meet seasonal fluctuations in working capital requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided dollars in thousands payments due by period total within year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments input letters of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on june   which expires on june   to minimize the risks and costs associated with its financing activities 
under the swap agreement  the company pays fixed rate interest and receives variable libor interest rate payments periodically over the life of the instrument 
the notional interest rate swap amount is million and is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the exposure due to credit loss 
the company s interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge  qualifies for the short cut method of assessing effectiveness and is considered highly effective  as defined by fasb statement no 
under the short cut method there is no need to measure effectiveness of the hedge and there is no charge to earnings for changes in the fair value of the swap agreement 
payments or receipts on the swap agreement are recorded as interest expense 
at february   the fair value of the swap was a loss of  net of the related tax benefit 
the unrealized loss from this interest rate swap is included in other comprehensive income and is shown as a component of stockholders equity 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
seasonality and inflation the following table sets forth the company s unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal and this information is unaudited  but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
fiscal dollars in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales of full year net sales operating income loss fiscal dollars in millions net sales of full year net sales operating income the results for the last three quarters of fiscal are not comparable to the other periods presented  due to the inclusion of oshman s results of operations  since june   the date of acquisition 
the fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter for the company 
for fiscal and the fourth quarter contributed and  respectively  of net sales 
comparable store sales for weeks ended february  increased and for the week period ended february  the company believes that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality first  sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season  second  holiday sales contribute significantly to the company s operating results 
as a result of these factors  inventory levels  which gradually increase beginning in april  generally reach their peak in november and then decline to their lowest level following the december holiday season 
any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter  whether due to a slow holiday selling season  poor snowfall in ski areas near the company s markets or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year 
although the operations of the company are influenced by general economic conditions  the company does not believe that inflation has a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company believes that it is generally able to pass along any inflationary increases in costs to its customers

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement became effective in the first quarter of fiscal year the new statement requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at its fair value  and requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company adopted this statement on february  and there was not a material impact on results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations consummated after june  and establishes criteria for recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that upon adoption  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will cease and instead  the carrying value of goodwill and these intangibles will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
in addition  a transitional impairment test is required as of the date of adoption 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for the period commencing february   the beginning of its fiscal the company has completed its impairment analysis of its existing goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal  and has determined that no impairment is indicated 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in regard to the impairment provisions of the statement  while the application of the non amortization provisions of the statement will result in the cessation of amortization of approximately million per year 
amortization of the company s existing goodwill totalled million in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of oshman s  which occurred on june  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses certain implementation issues related to sfas no

 but does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the company s long term debt agreement 
the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the us prime rate or libor at the time of the borrowing 
the company maintains portions of its debt in libor traunches that mature in one to nine months 
as those traunches mature the interest rates on the company s outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or libor rates 
therefore  the company s interest expense changes as prime or libor change 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company entered into an interest rate swap instrument  designated as a cash flow hedge as shown in the following table rate paid rate received notional amount fair value at mo 
us libor based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at february   a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under the credit facility would change the company s after tax earnings by approximately million over a month period 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because the company does not operate any stores outside of the united states 
the company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during the quarter or year to date periods in fiscal  or the fair value of the company s investments in marketable equity securities at february  was  the fair value of these investments will fluctuate as the quoted market prices of such securities fluctuate 
as of february   the fair value of the company s investments in marketable equity securities fluctuate 
as of february   the fair value of the company s investments in marketable equity securities was  greater than the adjusted basis of those investments 
such unrealized holding gain has not been recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations  but rather has been recorded as a component of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income loss 
the actual gain or loss that the company will realize when such investments are sold will depend on the fair value of such securities at the time of sale 
based on the company s marketable equity securities portfolio and quoted market prices at february   a increase or decrease in the market price of such securities would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the fair value of the marketable equity securities portfolio 
although changes in quoted market prices may affect the fair value of the marketable equities securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold or determined to have a decline in value  which is other than temporary
