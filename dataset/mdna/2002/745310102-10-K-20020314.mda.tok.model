electric revenues in decreased due to decreased prices and kilowatt hours sold related to electric energy sales to other utilities and marketers and sales to customers whose rates were tied to a market index 
these customers can choose another supplier or self generate their energy needs 
several index rate customers have switched to transportation rate tariffs beginning in july as allowed by a washington commission order dated april  authorizing the establishment of a transportation tariff 
on june   ferc implemented price controls on wholesale electricity in the western states 
several factors have contributed to the dramatic decline in wholesale electric prices by the end of the second quarter of and  therefore  have greatly diminished the value of pse s excess electric energy during that period and into the foreseeable future 
pse and other western utilities filed an appeal asking ferc to review its june  order and make modifications to the price controls to stabilize wholesale prices in california and prevent the energy problems from spreading to other states 
on december   ferc issued an order on clarification and rehearing addressing  in part  the company s petition for rehearing on the june  order 
the company and other entities have sought further rehearing and clarification of the december  order 
pse continues to operate without an electric rate adjustment mechanism 
electric revenues were reduced by approximately million in related to a customer conservation incentive credit which was approved by the washington commission on april  the conservation incentive credit was to reduce customers bills by per kwh for each kwh reduction in excess of from the same billing period in the prior year through december  on november   the washington commission approved pse s request to terminate the conservation incentive credit program effective november  on april   the washington commission approved time of day rates for approximately  residential electric customers for the period may  through september  on september   the washington commission authorized the extension of the time of day rates pilot program for residential customers through may  to allow approximately  business customers to participate in a time of day rates program from october  through september  in the order  if the cumulative revenues collected under time of day tariffs during the beginning through the end of the programs exceed the revenues that would have been collected under the original tariffs  pse must defer any overcollection and refund it to participating customers 
through december   revenues billed under the time of day tariff have been slightly less than original tariffs by an immaterial amount  thus no deferred liability was established at december  personal energy managementtm consumption information is available to all classes of customers 
customers are able to monitor their energy usage and shift usage to low demand off peak periods 
this program reduces the demand for peak power generation 
revenues from electric customers in and were reduced by a residential and farm energy exchange credit tariff in place since october  under the rate plan approved by the washington commission in its merger order  pse reflected in customers bills the level of residential exchange benefits in place at the time of the merger with washington energy company in on january   pse and bonneville power administration bpa signed an agreement under which pse received payments from bpa of approximately million over an approximate five year period that ended june these payments were recorded as a reduction of purchased electricity expenses 
as a result of lower usage by residential and farm customers in  the residential and farm exchange credit decreased by million as compared to and increased in by million as compared to on june   the washington commission approved an amended residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and bpa  under which pse s residential and small farm customers would receive benefits of federal power 
completion of this agreement enables pse to continue to provide  and in fact increase  effective january   the residential and farm energy exchange credit to residential and small farm customers 
the amended settlement agreement provides that pse will receive for its residential and small farm customers a cash payment benefits during the period july  through september  and b benefits in the form of power or cash payments during the period october  through september  any such benefits may vary  depending on the outcome of regulatory and legal proceedings and reviews 
for example a number of parties are challenging in the ninth circuit court of appeals bpa s authority to enter into or perform the amended residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and bpa 
for calendar  the benefits of the residential and farm energy exchange credited to customers was million as compared to an offsetting reduction in purchased electricity expense of million 
pse expects payments from bpa recorded as a reduction in purchased electricity expense in the amount of million for the period january through september and million for the period october through september eligible residential and small farm customers will receive credits to their bills in the same amount 
on october   the public counsel section of the washington state attorney general s office filed a complaint with the washington commission alleging that pse has violated the washington commission s merger order 
the public counsel s complaint is that pse s residential and small farm customers should receive both the reduction in rates equal to the residential exchange credit in place prior to july   and in addition  the benefits of the amended agreement for residential and small farm benefits received from bpa 
if public counsel s position were upheld  pse s electric revenues for the last six months of would be reduced by approximately million 
while pse believes this complaint is without merit  pse is unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding 
a decision in the proceeding is expected in pse operates within the western wholesale market and has made sales into the california energy market 
during the first quarter of  pse received partial payments for sales made in the fourth quarter of at december   pse s receivables from the california independent system operator caiso and other counter parties  net of reserves  were million 
at december   such receivables  net of reserves  were approximately million 
in and  pse collected and remitted to two grantor trusts  million and million  respectively  as a result of pse s sale of future electric revenues associated with million of its investment in conservation assets in its electric general rate tariff 
the impact of the sale of revenue  was offset by reductions in conservation amortization and interest expenses 
the principal amounts owed by the trusts to its bondholders were million and million at december  and  respectively 
on april   the washington commission issued an order allowing pse s large industrial customers whose rates were linked to a market index to choose their supplier of electricity or to self generate 
if an industrial customer chooses an alternate supplier  pse will provide the transportation of electricity to the customer s premises and charge that customer for the service 
to meet customer demand  pse s power supply portfolio includes net purchases of power under long term supply contracts 
however  depending principally upon streamflow available for hydroelectric generation and weather effects on customer demand  from time to time  pse may have surplus power available for sale to wholesale customers 
pse manages its core energy portfolio through short and intermediate term purchases  sales  arbitrage and other risk management techniques 
pse also operates its combustion turbine plants located in western washington when it is cost effective to do so 
during the first nine months of  pse has operated its combustion turbine plants extensively to meet retail load requirements 
pse s risk management committee oversees energy price risk matters 
operating revenues gas regulated gas utility revenues in increased by million from the prior year 
total gas volumes  including transported gas  decreased in from the primary reason for the increase in gas sales was the higher natural gas prices which are passed through to customers in the purchased gas adjustment pga 
gas rates to all sales customers increased by an average of on august  and on january   offset by an decrease in gas rates under the pga effective september  higher priced firm gas sales comprised a larger percentage of total therm sales in compared to which also contributed to increased revenues 
utility gas margin the difference between gas revenues and gas purchases decreased by million  or  in over regulated gas utility sales revenue in increased by million from the prior year on a increase in gas volumes sold 
total gas volumes  including transported gas  decreased in from other revenues infrastrux total operating revenues increased million in compared to from the acquisitions made in the third quarter of and throughout pse s other revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to increased revenues at pse s real estate investment and development subsidiary  puget western  inc other revenues decreased million in compared to due primarily to decreased revenues at puget western  inc and the sale of a wholly owned subsidiary  homeguard security services  inc in operating expenses purchased electricity expenses decreased million in when compared to and increased million in when compared to the decrease in was due primarily to lower volumes and significantly lower prices for non firm power purchases from other utilities and marketers due to declining prices in the west coast power market beginning in the second half of the increase in as compared to was due primarily to greater volumes and significantly higher prices for non firm power purchases from other utilities and marketers during the last seven months of due to increasing prices in the west coast power market 
residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in when compared to  due to the terms set out in the residential exchange termination agreement and the residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and bpa discussed in operating revenues electric 
beginning july  all residential exchange credits are passed through to eligible residential and small farm customers by a corresponding reduction in revenues 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the impact of increased gas costs  which are passed through to customers through the pga mechanism  offset by a decrease in sales volumes 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to due to the impact of increased gas costs  which are passed through to customers through the pga mechanism and a increase in sales volumes 
the pga allows pse to recover expected increases in gas costs 
pse defers  as a receivable  any gas costs that exceed the amount in pga rates and accrues interest under the pga 
the balance of the pga receivable was million and million for december  and  respectively 
electric generation fuel expense increased million in compared to  compared to an increase of million in compared to  as a result of increased generation and higher fuel costs at combustion turbine facilities 
these facilities operated at much higher levels in compared to the same period in due to adverse hydroelectric conditions 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
statement no 
was adopted on january  during  an increase to current earnings of approximately million pre tax million after tax was recognized for unrealized gains associated with electric derivative transactions and a million after tax transition adjustment loss was recorded during resulting from recognizing the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
for further discussion see note 
production operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to an approximately million increase in lease costs associated with the new fredonia and units  offset by reduced operating costs resulting from the sale of the centralia generating station in may  and a net cost of million after estimated insurance recovery to repair the pse owned fredonia combustion turbine unit  which was out of service from february  through may  pse has received partial payments of million associated with an amended million insurance claim and is awaiting payment on the remainder 
production operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due to increased energy production and maintenance work at company owned combustion turbine plants  inventory write downs at colstrip and full months of encogen generating station costs versus months in pse s personal energy management energy efficiency program costs increased million in  reflecting a full year of implementation compared to pse began providing personal energy management billing information to electric customers in december which resulted in a million increase in costs in compared to the personal energy managementtm program helps to minimize energy purchases at peak times when electric energy is most costly 
other utility operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to repair costs associated with storm and earthquake damage in  increased meter reading expenses associated with providing personal energy managementtm  and a one time insurance recovery received in other utility operations and maintenance costs decreased million in compared to due primarily to high costs related to year remediation expenses in not incurred in and the reduction in of electric service restoration costs that followed a number of storms which occurred in early infrastrux operation and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to due to its acquisitions beginning in pse s other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses at connext  the assets of which were sold in the third quarter of other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses at connext and from the sale of homeguard security services  inc in depreciation and amortization expenses increased million in compared to due to the effects of new plant placed into service during  including consumerlinx  a customer information and billing system  which was placed into service in phases through late and early depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of new plant placed into service during taxes other than federal income taxes increased million in compared to and million in compared to due primarily to increases in municipal taxes and state excise taxes that are revenue based 
federal income taxes decreased by million in compared to  and increased million in compared to primarily due to changes in pre tax operating income for the periods 
other income other income  net of federal income tax  increased million in compared to due primarily to million of reserves established in for a write down to the fair values of certain assets held for sale by hydro energy development corp 
to their net realizable values not recurring in  million of other income realized by puget western  inc on investments in not recurring in  million of increase in other income of connext primarily from sales of assets in  offset by reductions in other income in for additional amortization of goodwill from acquisitions by infrastrux  officer incentive compensation accruals  and decreased other interest and dividend income 
other income  net of federal income tax  decreased million in compared to due primarily to an after tax gain in of million on the sale of cabot common stock in the second quarter of  and an after tax gain of million related to the sale and assignment of certain non core assets and supply transportation contracts in the decrease is also related to the establishment in of an after tax reserve of million for a write down to the fair values of certain assets held for sale by hydro energy development corp 
to their net realizable values 
the decrease in was partially offset by the after tax gain of approximately million related to the sale of the centralia generating plant 
interest charges interest charges  which consist of interest and amortization on long term debt and other interest  increased million in compared to as a result of the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series b  in september  the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series c  in november  and the issuance of million trust preferred securities in may in addition  infrastrux borrowings increased interest charges by million in compared to other interest expense decreased million compared to as a result of lower weighted average interest rates and lower average daily short term borrowings 
interest charges increased million in compared to as a result of the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series b  in february  the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series b  in september  and the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series c  in november these increases were partially offset by the repayment of million in secured medium term notes since september and million of encogen debt in february other interest expense increased million compared to as a result of higher weighted average interest rates and higher average daily short term borrowings

the proceeds from the sale of trust securities were used by the trusts to purchase junior subordinated debentures debentures from pse 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts and pse owns all common securities of the trusts 
on october   the board of directors of pse declared a dividend payable on january  for preferred stock outstanding on december in april  pse entered into a lease line of up to million with a financial institution  under which pse leases two combustion turbines for its fredonia and electric generation facility 
the lease has a term expiring in  but can be cancelled by pse after three years 
lease payments and amortization under the lease include interest equal to above the london inter bank offered rate libor 
at december   pse s outstanding balance under the lease was million 
for purposes of the table  lease payments assume a libor of 
the expected residual value under the lease is the lesser of million or of the cost of the equipment 
in the event the equipment is sold to a third party upon termination of the lease and the aggregate sales proceeds are less than of the unamortized value of the equipment  pse would be required to pay the lessor an amount equal to the deficiency 
in june  infrastrux signed a credit agreement with several banks to provide up to million in financing 
under the credit agreement  puget energy is the guarantor of the line of credit 
at december   pse had million in lines of credit with various banks  which provide credit support for the outstanding bank loans and commercial paper of million  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under these lines of credit to million 
infrastrux had million in lines of credits with various banks  which fund capital requirements of infrastrux and its subsidiaries

see note above with respect to pse 
pse has sold a stream of future electric revenues associated with million of its investment in conservation assets in its electric general rate tariff to two grantor trusts 
as a result of this sale  pse collects these revenues from its electric customers and remits them to the trusts 
during  pse collected and remitted million to the trusts 
additional principle amounts expected to be collected on behalf of the trusts are million at december  utility construction program current utility construction expenditures for generation  transmission and distribution are designed to meet continuing customer growth and to improve efficiencies of pse s energy delivery systems 
construction expenditures  excluding equity allowance for funds used during construction afudc  were million in pse expects construction expenditures will be approximately million in pse has not projected the level of construction expenditures for periods beyond as such amounts will be dependent upon the outcomes of pse s interim and general rate case filings described below 
construction expenditure estimates are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and conservation factors 
other additions other property  plant and equipment additions were million in puget energy expects infrastrux s capital additions to be million in infrastrux will continue to acquire companies related to utility infrastructure services with their available line of credit and cash 
capital resources cash from operations cash generated from operations net of dividends and afudc totaled million for the three year period  and provided of the million of utility construction expenditures net of afudc other capital expenditure requirements for that period 
internal cash generation net of dividends and afudc provided of total capital expenditure requirements in  in and in if pse s requested interim and general rate increases are denied  cash from operations net of dividends and afudc during is projected to be approximately of estimated construction expenditures excluding afudc and other capital expenditure requirements 
assuming pse s requested interim and general rate increases are approved in full  cash from operations net of dividends and afudc during would be approximately of estimated utility construction expenditures excluding afudc and other capital expenditure requirements during puget energy and pse expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and externally financed capital 
financing program financing utility construction requirements and operational needs is dependent upon the cost and availability of external funds through capital markets and from financial institutions 
access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic conditions  regulatory authorizations and policies  and puget energy s and pse s credit ratings 
restrictive covenants in determining the type and amount of future financing  pse may be limited by restrictions contained in its electric and gas mortgage indentures  articles of incorporation and certain loan agreements 
under the most restrictive tests  at december   pse could issue approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds  at an assumed interest rate of however  see general and interim rate proceedings sections below  approximately million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of  and approximately million of unsecured long term debt 
credit ratings neither puget energy nor pse has any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of their debt 
however  a downgrade in the senior secured credit ratings could adversely affect the companies ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities 
for example  under pse s revolving credit facility  the spreads over the index and commitment fee increase as pse s secured long term debt ratings decline 
a downgrade in commercial paper ratings could preclude pse s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs 
in addition  any downgrade below investment grade of the senior secured debt could allow counterparties in the wholesale electric  wholesale gas and financial derivative markets to require pse to post a letter of credit or other collateral  make cash prepayments  obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security 
on october   standard poor s lowered its long term ratings on puget energy and pse following the washington commission s order of october  denying pse s request of august  for a power cost recovery mechanism and interim electric rate relief 
on october   standard poor s further downgraded its long term ratings of puget energy and pse following the washington commission s order of october   denying pse s petition that the washington commission reconsider their october  decision 
on october   moody s investors service placed the rating of puget energy and pse under review for possible downgrade following the washington commission s order of october  on october   moody s issued a report stating it was continuing their review for possible downgrade of its long term ratings of puget energy and pse until the washington commission acted on pse s december  filing for interim electric rate relief

short term borrowings and commercial paper pse s short term borrowings from banks and the sale of commercial paper are used to provide working capital for the utility construction program 
at december   pse had available million in lines of credit with various banks  which provide credit support for outstanding commercial paper of million and million of outstanding short term borrowing  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under these lines of credit to million 
in june  infrastrux signed a credit agreement with several banks to provide up to million in financing 
puget energy is the guarantor of the line of credit 
in addition  infrastrux s subsidiaries have million in lines of credits with various banks 
short term borrowings available for infrastrux are used to fund capital requirements of infrastrux and its subsidiaries 
on december   infrastrux and its subsidiaries had outstanding loans of million  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under these lines of credit to million 
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan puget energy has a stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to which existing shareholders and residents of the state of washington may invest cash and cash dividends in shares of puget energy s common stock 
since new shares of common stock may be purchased directly from puget energy  puget energy may receive funds for general corporate purposes through the program 
puget energy has registered  shares of common stock for sale pursuant to the plan in in and  puget energy issued  shares and  shares  respectively  resulting in proceeds of million and million 
at december    shares remained available for issuance under the plan 
general and interim rate proceedings on november   pse filed both an electric and gas general rate increase request with the washington commission 
the request is for a million increase in electric revenues and a million increase in base natural gas revenues 
by statute  the general rate case proceedings can take up to months from the time of the filing 
on december   pse filed petitions for an interim electric rate increase with the washington commission 
the interim filing is comprised of two parts a request for deferral of projected underrecovered power costs for the period january through february  approximately million and a surcharge to rates to collect in rates projected underrecovered power costs for the period march through october  approximately million and the deferred amount 
on december   the washington commission authorized pse to defer excess power costs for the period january  through march  pse projects the excess power costs for the period will be approximately million 
the final accounting order issued by the washington commission on december  stated that the deferred costs would be examined in the context of pse s interim and general rate case 
pse will bear the burden of proof to show such costs were prudently incurred and that deferred costs should be recovered in customer rates 
pse presently anticipates the washington commission will act on pse s interim request to approve the surcharge to electric rates before march  on february   pse filed rebuttal testimony revising the collection period for the million interim request as follows collection of million over the period march  through october  with the remaining deferral of million collected over the period november  through october  neither pse nor puget energy can predict the outcome of the interim and general rate cases 
denial by the washington commission  in whole or in substantial part  of pse s petitions for the interim electric rate increase and the general electric and gas rate increases  would have a material adverse impact on cash flows and earnings 
in particular  absent an adequate interim electric rate increase pse projects that earnings available for interest would fall below two times annual interest charges on outstanding first mortgage bonds as early as april  prohibiting the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds and  therefore  senior notes secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds  pse s and puget energy s credit ratings could be adjusted downward by standard poor s and moody s investors service upon their review of rate decisions of the washington commission  adversely affecting the cost and availability of capital  puget energy s ability to sell its common stock  and the price at which such stock could be sold  could be adversely impaired  and pse projects that it will exceed its short term borrowing limits available under existing credit lines in the latter part of if rate relief is not granted and puget energy and pse are unable to issue additional securities to finance operations  construction programs and other capital expenditures  the companies will fund operations and capital requirements through by taking extraordinary cash conservation measures 
these measures may include deferral of pse s construction expenditures and a reduction in operations and maintenance expenditures  and reduction in  or suspension of  dividends on puget energy s common stock 
rate matters electric the order approving the merger  issued by the washington commission on february   contained a rate plan designed to provide a five year period of rate certainty for customers and to provide pse with an opportunity to achieve a reasonable return on investment 
general electric tariff rates were stipulated to increase annually between and depending on rate class on january of through pse has had no electric rate adjustment mechanism during the rate stability period to adjust for changes in electric energy supply costs or fuel costs 
these variances may now significantly influence earnings 
the rate stabilization period ended on december  rate matters gas as a result of sharp increases in gas costs during  pse filed two pga and deferral amortization filings with the washington commission which were approved 
the pga filings allow pse to recover expected increases in annual gas costs and deferral amortization filings allow pse to recover prior period gas cost undercollections 
as a result  gas rates to all sales customers increased by an average of on august   and again on january  subsequent declines in gas costs led to pse obtaining approval of another pga and deferral amortization filing in resulting in an average reduction in gas sales rates on september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the pga mechanism 
other in the second quarter of  pse sold all of its redeemable convertible preferred stock of cabot for million 
there was no significant gain or loss on the transaction 
on july   ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine what refunds california energy buyers are due for purchases in the spot markets operated by the caiso or the california power exchange corporation covering the period october  through june  the presiding administrative law judge in this proceeding has set trial schedules during after which the presiding administrative law judge is expected to issue his finding of fact and record on the matter in august pse entered into transactions that may be subject to refund in this proceeding and is unable to predict the outcome of this ferc proceeding or any judicial proceeding arising therefrom 
on july   ferc also established a separate preliminary evidentiary proceeding for the purpose of exploring whether there have been excessive charges for spot market sales in the pacific northwest for the period december  through june  the presiding administrative law judge in the pacific northwest proceeding has issued a recommendation that refunds with respect to such charges during such period were not warranted 
ferc is reviewing this recommendation 
pse made transactions that may be subject to refund in this proceeding 
pse is unable to predict the outcomes of this ferc proceeding or any judicial proceeding arising therefrom 
in march  pse entered into an agreement with schlumberger north america schlumberger formerly known as cellnet data services inc under which pse would lend schlumberger up to million in the form of multiple draws so that schlumberger could finance an automated meter reading amr network system to be deployed in pse s service territory 
in september  pse announced it was expanding its amr network system from  meters to  meters and as a result increased the authorized loan amount to million 
as of december   the outstanding loan balance was million 
in august  schlumberger paid off its outstanding loan balance of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following areas represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain ferc accounting puget energy s regulated subsidiary  pse  prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in conformity with the ferc s uniform system of accounts 
the washington commission also requires pse to use ferc s uniform system of accounts 
cost basis regulation puget energy s regulated subsidiary  pse  is subject to regulation by the washington commission and ferc 
the rates that are charged by pse to its customers are based upon cost basis regulation reviewed and approved by these regulatory commissions 
under the authority of these commissions  pse has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities in the amount of million as of december  if pse s rates were no longer based upon cost basis or the probability of future collection in rates  regulation  the assets and liabilities would be written off to earnings 
derivatives puget energy uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its commodity price risks 
derivative financial instruments are accounted for under statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statement no 
accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the derivatives implementation group dig of the financial accounting standards board 
to the extent that changes by the dig modify current guidance  including the normal purchases and normal sales determination  the accounting treatment for derivatives may change 
to manage its utilization of generation supply  puget energy enters into contracts to purchase or sell electricity and gas 
these contracts are considered derivatives under statement no 
unless a determination is made that they qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exclusion 
if the exclusion applies  those contracts are not marked to market and are not reflected in the financial statements until delivery occurs 
the availability of the normal purchases and normal sales exclusion to specific contracts is based on a determination that excess generation is available for a forward sale and similarly a determination that at certain times generation supply will be insufficient to serve load 
this determination is based on internal models that forecast customer demand and generation supply 
the models include assumptions regarding customer load growth rates  which are influenced by the economy  weather and the impact of customer choice  and generating unit availability

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk puget energy is exposed to market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk puget energy s energy related businesses are exposed to risks related to changes in commodity prices 
as part of its business  puget energy markets power to wholesale customers by entering into contracts to purchase or supply electric energy or natural gas at specified delivery points and at specified future delivery dates

ensure that physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer requirements  ii 
manage portfolio risks to limit undesired impacts on pse financial results  and iii

at certain times  these sources of variability can mitigate portfolio imbalances  at other times they can exacerbate portfolio imbalances 
hedging strategies for puget energy s energy supply portfolio interact with portfolio optimization activities 
some hedges can be implemented in ways that retain puget energy s ability to use its energy supply portfolio to produce additional value  other hedges can only be achieved by forgoing optimization opportunities 
the prices of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  generation outages and other factors which impact supply and demand
