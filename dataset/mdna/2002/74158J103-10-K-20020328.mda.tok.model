liquidity and capital resources recent developments 
as previously disclosed  we and our financial advisor s have been exploring the possibility of various strategic alternatives  includin g the possible sale or joint venture of all of a portion of our office an d industrial portfolios  and the possible sale of the entire company or a simila r business combination transaction 
notwithstanding the substantial efforts o f management and our financial advisors  we have not been successful in executin g a strategic transaction on terms we feel are favorable to our shareholders 
w e continue to pursue possible strategic alternatives that would be beneficial t o our shareholders  however  there can be no assurance that any such transactio n or transactions will occur 
liquidity 
net cash provided from operations represents the primary sourc e of liquidity to fund distributions  debt service and recurring capital costs 
i n order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must distribut e of our taxable income excluding capital gains annually 
in accordance wit h their revised terms  we pay an annual dividend of up to a maximum of pe r annum per share for each series a preferred share  including th e deferred rate see preferred shares and per annum per share for each series b preferred share 
due to a number of factors  includin g our current capital resources and needs  our board decided not to pay a distribution on the common shares units for the fourth quarter of se e business strategies liquidity requirements 
any future distributions on our preferred and common shares of beneficial interest will b e made at the discretion of our board 
these distributions will depend on th e actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capita l requirements  the completion of certain proposed capital events  includin g certain refinancings and asset sales  the annual distribution requirements unde r the reit provisions of the code  and such other factors as our board deem s relevant 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to complete th e foregoing capital events or  if they are completed  whether they will be o n terms that are favorable to us 
we also can give no assurance that if thes e capital events are completed on terms favorable to us or otherwise distributions on our common shares and common units will be resumed either fo r the first quarter of or thereafter 
in addition  we can give no assurance s that we will continue to be able to make distributions on our preferred share s of beneficial interest 
under the terms of the construction loans related to the dearborn cente r development  we are required  among other things  to maintain a minimu m unrestricted cash balance of million at the end of each fiscal quarte r beginning with the end of the fiscal quarter ended december  a t december   the unrestricted cash balance was less than million 
i n consideration for the waiver from the lenders  we are required to deposit million into a cash collateral account over a fourth month period  with a million initial deposit made at the time the waiver was given  and to pledge  a s additional collateral under the loans  the tax increment financing payments tha t we will receive from the city of chicago with respect to dearborn center 
th e waiver covers the quarters ended december  and march  additionally  the lenders agreed to permanently reduce the millio n unrestricted cash balance covenant to million 
under the terms of three mortgage loans payable totaling million  w e are required to maintain million in unrestricted cash balances at the en d of each fiscal quarter 
at december   we did not have sufficien t unrestricted cash balances to meet this requirement 
during the first quarter o f  we obtained a waiver from the lender for the fiscal quarter ended decembe r  we do not expect to meet this requirement as of march  and w e are engaged in discussions with the lender to obtain a waiver for the fisca l quarter ended march  under the terms of a million mortage note payable collateralized b y three of our properties and a million letter of credit facility with th e same lender  we are required to limit the amount of distributions that can b e paid on our common shares and units to a maximum of of funds from operation s as defined for each calendar year 
at december  we did not meet thi s requirement with respect to calendar year in march  we obtaine d amendments to the mortgage loan and the letter of credit facility 
under th e amendments  we obtained a waiver of the distribution covenant for calendar yea r  and agreed  among other things  to increase a million guarant y related to a million mezzanine facility on our west monroe propert y with the same lender to a full guaranty of such mezzanine loan 
the covenants contained in many of our loan agreements and guarante e agreements with our lenders include minimum ratios for debt service coverage an d liabilities as a percentage of total assets  as well as minimum net worth level s and limits as to recourse indebtedness 
compliance with these covenants i s highly dependent on our financial results and could be impacted by futur e capital events such as asset sales  debt refinancings and new debt or equit y transactions 
there can be no assurance that we will meet these covenants in th e future and  if we do not meet a covenant  whether appropriate loan modification s or waivers can be obtained 
in addition  certain loans contain cross defaul t provisions whereby a default under the covenants related to one loan agreemen t would also result in a default under the provisions of one or more other loans failure to meet a covenant could result in a requirement for a principa l paydown  accelerated maturity  additional collateral or other changes in terms this could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional sources o f financing or equity capital 
given our current level of debt  availability of collateral and our curren t financing arrangements  we may not be able to obtain additional debt at interes t rates which are below the rates of return on our properties 
in addition  an y equity capital we might raise may be dilutive to our current shareholders 
a s previously discussed  we are currently negotiating with third parties to sel l certain properties in our portfolio 
there can be no assurances that we wil l consummate debt  equity or asset sales transactions which would yield proceed s of sufficient nature and in a timeframe necessary to fund our projecte d operating and capital needs on a current basis

in addition  we guarantee d  of a  mezzanine facility maturing on november  i n march  we increased our guaranty to a full loan guaranty of  i n consideration for an amendment to certain financial covenant requirement s related to a  mezzanine facility from the same lender maturing jun e  on january   we extended the maturity date of the  mortgage note payable secured by of its ownership interest in ib m plaza  chicago  illinois  until february  the guarantee of  is shown as expiring on february  however  the guarantee will i n fact expire at the same time as the maturity date of the mortgage not e payable on february  c the total represents tax indemnity payments accrued during and payabl e april   of  to ibd contributors and to nac contributor s for the sale of hintz road 
we also estimate our maximum possibl e exposure on tax indemnifications to be an additional  if al l indemnity properties had been sold as of december  the amount o f certain indemnities decreases by each calendar year

d dividends are cumulative and payable at a annual rate each quarte r that the series a preferred shares remain outstanding 
in addition  scp ha s a contractual right under the securities purchase agreement  as amended relating to the series a preferred shares  to require us to redeem th e series a preferred shares at a redemption price equal to per share plus accrued dividends to the date of redemption  upon days prio r written notice  which redemption may be required by scp at any time durin g the period from january  through january  on february  we amended the agreement and agreed to an additional deferra l payment  as defined  of calculated on the outstanding series a preferred shares 
this payment accrues from february  to the date o f notice of redemption  is payable at redemption and compounds quarterl y beginning march  the deferral payment increases by every days up to a maximum of 
as notice of redemption has not been given the timing and total amount ultimately payable is not determinable and are therefore  not shown herein 
we are now  and may from time to time in th e future  continue to negotiate scp to modify the terms of the securitie s purchase agreement 
e dividends are cumulative and payable at a annual rate each quarte r that the series b preferred shares remain outstanding 
the series b preferred shares rank senior to the common shares and the series a preferred shares as to the payment of dividends 
as discussed under capital improvements  we anticipate the funding of increased capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasin g commissions in  primarily in our suburban office portfolio  to retenan t space that has recently vacated or is anticipated to be vacated during the year anticipated cash flow from operations  after the funding of debt servic e payments and other fixed charges  is not sufficient to fund these expenditures therefore  these activities are highly dependent on our ability to obtai n additional financing or equity capital or to sell assets 
failure to obtai n additional sources of funds from debt or equity transactions or from th e proceeds of asset sales would severely impact our ability to re lease an d properly maintain our properties 
tenant concentration 
the following represents our five largest tenant s based on gross revenue received during in thousands gross of total tenant company tenant revenue revenue arthur andersen  jenner block  national city bank  ibm corporation  motorola  if one or more of these tenants were to experience financial difficultie s and cease paying rent  our cash flow and earnings would likely be negativel y impacted in the near term 
the extent and length of this would be impacted b y several factors  including o the nature of the financial difficulties  o our ability to obtain control of the space for releasing  o market conditions  o the length of time it would require for us to release the tenant s space and o whether the tenant s rent was above or below market 
arthur andersen llp currently leases  net rentable square feet i n two of our office properties  square feet at west monroe street an d  square feet at north wabash avenue 
arthur andersen s current net rent at these properties is substantially below market rent for comparabl e buildings in the downtown chicago office market 
given the widely publicize d uncertainties facing arthur andersen  there can be no assurance that arthu r andersen will continue to occupy space in our portfolio  pay rent for such spac e on a timely basis  and fulfill its lease obligations 
if arthur andersen were t o cease payment of its rental obligation  this would negatively impact our abilit y to meet our financial obligations 
property sales 
during the year ended december   we sold variou s office and industrial properties and vacant land parcels see recent developments and used a portion of the net proceeds to acquire other office and industrial properties and land parcels  retire debt  fund developmen t activities and for general corporate needs 
preferred shares 
our outstanding preferred shares contain restrictions o n our ability to issue additional preferred shares and  in certain circumstances incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  scp  the holder of our series a preferred shares  has a current contractual right under the securities purchas e agreement  as amended  relating to the series a preferred shares  to require u s to redeem the series a preferred shares at a redemption price equal to pe r share  plus accrued dividends to the date of redemption  upon days prio r written notice  which redemption may be required by scp at any time during th e period from january  through january  on february   w e amended the agreement and agreed to an additional deferral payment as defined of calculated on the outstanding series a preferred shares 
this paymen t accrues from february  to the date of notice of redemption  is payable a t redemption and compounds quarterly beginning march  the deferra l payment increases by percent every days up to a maximum rate of we are now  and may from time to time in the future  continue to negotiate wit h scp to modify the terms of the securities purchase agreement 
our anticipated cash flows from operations in may not be sufficient t o fund our preferred dividends on a current basis 
payment of these dividends ma y be dependent on our ability to defer the funding of our capital requirement s and or to obtain additional financing and equity capital or to sell assets failure to obtain additional sources of funds from debt or equity capital o r from the proceeds of asset sales may result in a suspension of our series a an d series b preferred share dividends on a current basis 
as a result of an y suspension  our series a preferred shareholder may decide to exercise its pu t right 
in addition  the holders of our series a preferred shares have the righ t to elect one additional member to our board or two additional members if ou r board consists of more than members if two consecutive quarterl y distributions i on the series a preferred shares  or ii on our common share s in an amount of at least per share  are not made

tax indemnity agreements 
in connection with the contribution of certai n properties during our initial public offering  we entered into ta x indemnifications with certain principals affiliated with edward s 
hadesman  on e of our executive officers  and certain principals affiliated with stephen j nardi  one of our trustees 
the terms of these agreements are discussed i n certain relationships and related transactions tax indemnification agreements 
on december   we purchased and amended the mortgage not e encumbering the property known as continental towers located in rolling meadows illinois 
as part of this transaction  we agreed to indemnify the two limite d partners the principals of the limited partnership which owns the property for  among other things  the federal and applicable state income ta x liabilities that result from the income or gain which they recognize upo n refinancing  sale  foreclosure or other action taken by us with respect to th e property or the mortgage note a tax event 
under the terms of the agreement  if an indemnification event  as defined  results in a tax event  w e are required to immediately pay to the principals the amount of any resultin g federal or state tax  including any interest and penalties  as well as a gross up amount that effectively results in the principals receiving this indemnity payment on a net  after tax basis 
however  if a legal opinion i s obtained from independent tax counsel that the indemnification even t should not trigger a tax event resulting in taxable income or gain to the principals  no indemnity payment is immediately required 
if the lega l opinion obtained from independent tax counsel states that the principals have a reasonable basis for reporting the indemnification event without including any taxable income or gain  no indemnity payment is immediatel y required 
in either case  the indemnity payment would be required if a tax even t occurred 
however  if a reasonable basis opinion is received regarding an indemnification event and if our equity market capitalization i s less than million but more than million  we are required t o deposit of the total indemnity amount into an escrow in cash or in the for m of a letter of credit 
if i an indemnification event occurs and our equit y market capitalization falls below million for more than consecutiv e trading days  ii or immediately after we sell or otherwise dispose of th e lesser of million or of our gross assets within a twelve month perio d a trigger disposition  we desire to cause an indemnification event and our equity market capitalization is less than million  then we wil l be required to deposit of the total indemnity amount into the escrow 
i n addition  in the case of a trigger disposition and our equity marke t capitalization falls below million  the principals may acquire th e general partnership interest in the limited partnership which owns the propert y for  and be able to prevent the indemnification event from occurring 
th e tax indemnity obligation expires january  we estimate our maximu m possible exposure at december  is million 
as discussed above  sales of properties which result in taxable income t o parties covered by tax indemnification agreements would create an indemnit y obligation on our part to the indemnified party 
in order to mitigate thi s obligation  we may enter into tax deferred exchange transactions  which woul d defer the tax sale and related indemnity obligation 
proceeds available to u s from sales of properties covered by indemnity properties would be reduced by th e amount necessary to fund any indemnity payment or to purchase properties t o satisfy tax deferred exchange transactions 
indebtedness

at december   thi s indebtedness had a weighted average maturity of years and bore interest a t a weighted average interest rate of per annum

the interest rat e ceiling under the agreement was based on a libor index rate of and th e interest rate floor is based on a libor index rate of 
on november  the underlying note was refinanced with the proceeds of a millio n mortgage note payable 
the collar agreement remained in place and was designate d to the new loan in conjunction with an additional interest rate cap agreement on november   we also entered into an interest rate cap agreement fo r the period from november   through january  the interest rat e under the agreement is capped at the libor index rate of

thompson  one of our trustees  is chairman of the la w firm of winston amp  strawn  which has provided  and continues to provide  legal services to us 
winston amp  strawn earned fees of million for legal services provided to us in critical accounting policies general 
the previous discussion and analysis of our financial conditio n and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generall y accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statement s requires us to make estimates and judgments about the effects of matters o r future events that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments ma y affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  an d related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates  including contingencies and litigation 
we base thes e estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that w e believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which and thes e estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values o f assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actua l results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions o r conditions 
to assist in understanding our results of operations and financia l position  we have identified our critical accounting policies and discussed the m below 
these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of ou r results and financial position  either because of the significance of th e financial statement items to which they relate or because they require ou r management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we monitor the liquidity an d creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis 
we maintain allowances fo r doubtful accounts using the specific identification method for estimated losse s resulting from the inability of certain of our tenants to make payments require d by the terms of their respective leases 
no general reserve is recorded 
if th e financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowance s may be required 
deferred tax asset 
we account for income taxes payable by our service s company in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized usin g enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book an d tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires tha t deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likel y than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not b e realized 
at december   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferre d tax liabilities of million included in other assets in our consolidate d balance sheet 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets b y assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are ou r forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies tha t could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax 
we have used tax plannin g strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid th e potential loss of future tax benefits 
approximately million of future taxable income earned by our service s company is ultimately required to realize the net deferred tax assets a t december  this is based on the recognition in future years by th e services company of taxable income anticipated from certain build to sui t activities and management fees earned on two of our properties 
failure t o achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of th e net deferred tax assets described above 
factors that may affect our ability t o achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to unanticipated decreases in the profitability of build to suit activities and o r the sale of properties and subsequent loss of the related management contracts 
assumed lease liabilities 
as a result of the negotiation of certai n leases  we assumed the liability for the tenants obligation or agreed to reimburse the tenants for their obligation under leases with their prior landlords 
in addition  in connection with the sale of certain industria l properties in  we agreed to a master lease agreement for certain propertie s for a defined period 
our services company agreed to a similar arrangement i n february in connection with a contract to sell an industrial property 
ou r policy is to record the estimated net obligation we may be subject to as a liability 
the net obligation is derived by calculating our total contractua l obligation and reducing the amount by existing subleases and an estimate o f subleases we anticipate signing in the future based on the nature of the space the property and market conditions 
we periodically review these estimates fo r reasonableness based on changes in market conditions and executed subleases failure to achieve forecasted results could lead to a future increase in th e liabilities associated with these transactions 
provisions for impairment 
in evaluating our assets for impairment  i n accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate tha t the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to b e generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets impairment losses are measured as the difference between carrying value and fai r value of assets 
beginning in  we will follow the guidance of statement o f financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 assets which display indicators of possible impairment are reviewed to see i f their net book value will be recovered from estimated cash flows over a n anticipated hold period 
if these cash flows  plus the proceeds from a sale a t the end of the anticipated hold period  are less than the net book value of ou r related asset  our policy is to record an impairment reserve related to th e asset in the amount of the difference between its net book value and ou r estimate of its fair market value  less costs of sale 
in evaluating our assets for impairment at december   we assume d anticipated hold periods of three to five years for many of our operatin g properties and concluded no reserve was warranted for these properties at thi s time 
however  as discussed under liquidity and capital resources we may need to sell assets to meet our liquidity needs during if ou r anticipated hold periods for certain assets were shortened  impairment reserve s would be required 
these reserves would have significant impacts on ou r operating results 
impact of recently issued accounting standards on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard s sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no

additionally  the fai r value adjustments will affect either shareholders equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge fo r accounting purposes and  if so  the nature of the hedging activity 
upo n adoption of sfas and sfas  we recorded as a cumulative effect of a n accounting change a net transition adjustment unrealized loss of millio n in net income  and a transition adjustment of million as an increase i n accumulated other comprehensive loss 
adoption of the standard resulted in a ne t transition adjustment of million on our balance sheet reflected as a million reduction in deferred costs  a million reduction in investment i n unconsolidated entities and a deferred hedge liability of million
