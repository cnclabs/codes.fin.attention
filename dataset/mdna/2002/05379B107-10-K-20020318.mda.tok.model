electric operations in addition to providing electric transmission and distribution services  avista utilities generates electricity for sales to retail customers 
avista utilities owns and operates eight hydroelectric projects  a wood waste fueled generating station and a two unit natural gas fired combustion turbine ct generating facility 
it also owns a percent share in a two unit coal fired generating facility and leases and operates a two unit natural gas fired ct generating facility 
in addition  avista utilities has a number of long term power purchase and exchange contracts that increase its available resources 
see item properties for further information with respect to generation properties 
avista utilities plans to add new generation assets in with the planned completion of the coyote springs project and the addition of two small generation facilities 
historically  avista utilities electric rates to retail customers have been among the lowest of investor owned utilities in the united states  due primarily to its large proportion of hydroelectric resources as compared to other investor owned utilities 
retail electric rates remain low  relative to other investor owned utilities in the united states  even after the enactment of recent temporary surcharges and rate increases 
see regulatory issues power cost deferrals for further information 
avista utilities sells and purchases electric capacity and energy to and from utilities and other entities in the wholesale market under long term contracts having terms of more than one year 
in addition  avista utilities engages in an ongoing process of resource optimization which involves short term purchases and sales in the wholesale market in pursuit of an economic selection of resources to serve retail and wholesale loads 
avista utilities makes continuing projections of future retail and wholesale loads based on  among other things  forward estimates of factors such as customer usage and weather as well as historical data and contract terms and resource availability based on  among other things  estimates of streamflows  generating unit availability  historic and forward market information and experience 
on the basis of these continuing projections  avista utilities makes purchases and sales of energy on a quarterly  monthly  daily and hourly basis to match actual resources to actual energy requirements and to sell any surplus at the best available price 
this process includes hedging transactions 
avista utilities competes in the electric wholesale market with other utilities  federal marketing agencies and power marketers 
the electric wholesale market has changed significantly over the last few years with respect to market participants involved  level of activity  variability of prices  ferc imposed price caps and counterparty credit issues 
these changes contributed to the increased volatility of the wholesale market during and the first half of during the second half of wholesale market prices and volatility both decreased to levels similar to those 
table of contents avista corporation experienced before see western power market issues and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations western power market issues for more information 
challenges facing avista utilities electric operations include  among other things  the ability to recover deferred power supply costs and the timing of such recovery  changes in the availability of and volatility in the prices of power and fuel  generating unit availability  legislative and governmental regulations  and weather conditions 
avista utilities believes it faces minimal risk for stranded utility assets resulting from deregulation due to its relatively low cost generation portfolio 
in a deregulated environment  however  evolving technologies that provide alternate energy supplies could affect the market price of power  and certain generating assets could have capital and operating costs above the adjusted market price 
avista utilities may also be exposed to refunds for wholesale power sales depending on the outcome of the ferc s retroactive price cap proceeding for the pacific northwest  however  avista utilities would have the opportunity to establish offsetting claims

electric requirements annual peak requirements for were  mw including long term wholesale obligations of mw and short term wholesale obligations of mw 
this peak occurred on january  at which time the maximum resource capacity available from avista utilities was  mw 
the maximum resource capacity included  mw of company owned electric generation  mw from long term hydroelectric contracts  mw of other long term wholesale purchases and  mw of short term wholesale purchases 
variations in energy usage by avista utilities customers occur from year to year  from season to season and from month to month within a season  primarily as a result of weather conditions 
this necessitates a continual balancing of loads and resources  and requires both purchases and sales of energy for annual  quarterly  monthly  daily and hourly periods in order to meet electric requirements and to prudently manage and optimize available resources 
electric resources general avista utilities diverse electric resource mix of hydroelectric projects  thermal generating facilities  and power purchases and exchanges  combined with strategic access to regional electric transmission systems  enables it to remain a low cost producer of electric energy 
as of december   avista utilities total owned and leased resource capability was approximately  mw  of which percent was hydroelectric and percent was thermal 
see avista utilities operating statistics electric operations for energy resource statistics 
hydroelectric resources hydroelectric generation is avista utilities lowest cost source per mwh of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on its total power supply costs 
under average operating conditions  avista utilities projects that it would be able to meet approximately one half of its total electric requirements both retail and long term wholesale with its own hydroelectric generation and fixed long term hydroelectric contracts with certain public utility districts in washington state 
total hydroelectric resource generation both company owned and purchased under long term hydroelectric contracts was million mwhs in  a decrease from million mwhs in and million mwhs in total hydroelectric resources including resources purchased under long term hydroelectric contracts provide amw or million mwhs annually under normal streamflow conditions 
the streamflows to company owned hydroelectric projects were percent  percent and percent of normal in  and  respectively 
in a critical water year defined by the northwest power pool as the worst water conditions on record  avista utilities would expect hydroelectric production of amw  amw below normal 
average hydroelectric production for the year was amw  which is amw below normal and the lowest level in the years in which records have been kept 
the combination of low hydroelectric production and other factors resulted in avista utilities incurring power supply costs during the second half of and the year significantly in excess of the amount of power supply costs recovered through retail rates in effect at the time

thermal resources avista utilities has a percent interest in a twin unit  coal fired generating facility  the colstrip generating project colstrip in southeastern montana 
avista utilities also owns a wood waste fired generating facility known as the kettle falls generating station kettle falls in northeastern washington and a two unit natural gas fired ct generating facility  located in northeast spokane northeast ct 
in addition  avista utilities also leases and operates a two unit natural gas fired ct generating facility in northern idaho rathdrum ct 

table of contents avista corporation until may  avista utilities had a percent interest in a twin unit  coal fired generating facility  the centralia power plant centralia in western washington 
in may  the owners of centralia sold the plant to transalta 
avista utilities is purchasing energy from transalta to replace the output from centralia for the period from july  through december  avista utilities receives approximately megawatts per hour during the term of the contract beginning each july and continuing through march of the following year 
colstrip  which is operated by ppl global  inc  is supplied with fuel under coal supply and transportation agreements in effect through december from adjacent coal reserves 
kettle falls primary fuel is wood waste generated as a by product from forest industry operations within miles of the plant 
natural gas may be used as an alternate fuel 
a combination of long term contracts plus spot purchases provides avista utilities the flexibility to meet expected future fuel requirements for the plant 
the northeast ct and rathdrum ct are natural gas fired generating units that were primarily used for peaking electric requirements prior to due to the shortage of hydroelectric generation during and and the relative operating cost compared to higher wholesale market prices  these generating units were operated on a more frequent basis 
the northeast ct and the rathdrum ct have access to natural gas supplies that are adequate to meet their respective operating needs 
the following table shows avista utilities thermal resource generation in thousands of mwhs during the years ended december centralia colstrip kettle falls northeast ct and rathdrum ct total thermal generation purchases  exchanges and sales avista utilities purchases power under various long term purchase contracts 
avista utilities also enters into a significant number of short term sales and purchases with terms of up to one year 
under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  avista utilities is required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities  including small hydroelectric and cogeneration projects  at rates approved by the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the idaho public utilities commission ipuc 
these contracts expire at various times through see avista utilities operating statistics electric energy resources for more detailed information with respect to purchased power and power from exchanges in  and future resource needs in august  the wutc approved avista utilities plan to increase its power resources to serve long term electric requirements 
the company evaluated third party supply side and demand side proposals submitted through the request for proposal process in in december  avista utilities selected the coyote springs project  located near boardman  oregon  as the supply side option 
the coyote springs project is a combined cycle  natural gas fired combustion turbine with generation output of approximately mw 
engineering and procurement of required major equipment began in january in december  the company completed the sale of percent of its interest in the coyote springs project to an affiliate of mirant americas development  inc mirant 
the company and mirant are sharing equally in the costs of construction  operation and output from the plant 
the total cost of the plant is expected to be approximately million 
upon completion of construction  expected to be in the third quarter of  the company s percent ownership interest in the coyote springs project will be transferred from avista power to avista corp 
to be operated as an asset of avista utilities 
due to the shortage of hydroelectric generation and high wholesale market prices during the first half of  avista utilities initiated the process of placing several small diesel and natural gas fired generators into operation at sites in its 
table of contents avista corporation service territory 
due to the reduction in wholesale market prices during the second half of  avista utilities reevaluated the cost of the small generation units and will not operate as many of the units as originally planned 
the boulder park generation facility boulder park located in spokane county and a small combustion generation unit in kettle falls  washington kettle falls ct will be in operation by mid these projects have a combined generation capability of mw 
as part of the strategy to mitigate the decrease in electric resources caused by the low hydroelectric availability and volatile energy markets  avista utilities implemented several buy back and rebate programs for retail customers during the programs were designed to encourage conservation and decrease average customer usage 
avista utilities has operational strategies to ensure that it has available resources sufficient to meet the increased demand for energy 
under normal water conditions and loads  avista utilities hydroelectric and thermal generation and long term contracts would have been able to provide percent of its forecasted native retail load and wholesale energy requirements during avista utilities has made purchases to enable it to cover its electric energy requirements for and believes that it will be in a surplus power position in and under normal water conditions 
forecasted electric energy requirements and resources amw requirements system load contracts for power sales total requirements resources system and contract hydro company owned thermal generation contracts for purchased power total resources surplus resources assumes normal water conditions  which is the mean of the years between and preliminary forecasts indicate streamflows are expected to be percent of normal in based on current snow pack conditions 
avista utilities currently estimates that hydroelectric generation will be amw in includes new generation available in from the company s percent ownership in the coyote springs project 
forecast assumes no generation from the northeast ct and the rathdrum ct  which are generally only used to meet peaking electric load requirements  and or when operating costs are lower than short term wholesale market prices 
significant customer a contract with avista utilities largest customer  potlatch corporation potlatch  expired on december  since potlatch had received service under a special contract under the purpa 
potlatch s lewiston  idaho facility includes about amw of electric requirements and approximately amw of self generation that is currently economic to operate 
avista utilities and potlatch are currently negotiating a new agreement 
as part of the new agreement  the parties have agreed that potlatch will receive electric service from avista at large industrial tariff schedule rates 
potlatch is currently using its generation for its own electric requirements  which results in a net electric requirement on avista utilities system of approximately amw 
although potlatch would like to sell its generation output  the current market price for wholesale electricity is below the schedule rates  therefore potlatch uses its generation to meet its electric requirements 
the ultimate resolution of this contract could have an impact on avista utilities resource planning  that avista utilities is working to minimize through continued negotiations of the terms and conditions associated with service to potlatch under schedule rates 
any changes in the revenue and expense associated with serving potlatch would be reflected in the idaho power cost adjustment mechanism pca

natural gas operations natural gas commodity prices increased dramatically during and remained high during the first half of before declining during the second half of the year 
natural gas commodity costs in excess of the amount recovered in current rates are deferred and recovered in future periods with applicable regulatory approval through adjustments to rates 
market prices for natural gas continue to be competitive compared to alternative fuel sources for residential  commercial and industrial customers 
avista utilities believes that natural gas should sustain its market advantage based on the levels of existing reserves and potential natural gas development in the future 
growth has occurred in the natural gas business due to increased demand for natural gas in new construction  as well as conversions from electric space and water heating to natural gas 
avista utilities makes sales and provides transportation service directly to large natural gas customers 
the majority of avista utilities large industrial customers purchase their own natural gas requirements through natural gas marketers 
for these customers  avista utilities provides transportation from its pipeline interconnection to the customer s premises 
seven of avista utilities largest natural gas customers are provided natural gas transportation service under individual contracts 
these negotiated contracts were entered into to retain these customers who can either by pass avista utilities distribution system or have competitive alternative fuel capability 
all individual contracts are subject to regulatory review and approval 
the competitive nature of the natural gas spot market results in savings in the cost of purchased natural gas  which encourages large customers with fuel switching capabilities to continue to utilize natural gas for their energy needs when economic 
the total volume transported on behalf of transportation customers for  and was  and million therms  which represented approximately percent  percent and percent of avista utilities total system deliveries  respectively 
challenges facing avista utilities natural gas operations include  among other things  volatility in the price of natural gas  changes in the availability of natural gas  legislative and governmental regulations  weather conditions  conservation and the ability to recover natural gas costs

jackson prairie natural gas storage project jackson prairie storage project avista utilities owns a one third interest in the jackson prairie storage project  an underground natural gas storage field located near chehalis  washington 
the role of the jackson prairie storage project in providing flexible natural gas supplies is important to avista utilities natural gas operations 
it enables avista utilities to place natural gas into storage when prices are low or to meet minimum natural gas purchasing requirements  as well as to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are high or as needed to meet high demand periods 
during  the process of increasing the capacity at the jackson prairie storage project was completed 
this increased capacity is being operated and managed by avista energy for a ten year period

the company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc for its wholesale natural gas rates charged for the release of capacity from the jackson prairie storage project  and for electric transmission service and wholesale electric sales 
the ferc also issued orders with respect to a price mitigation plan applicable to certain wholesale power transactions throughout the western united states during the period june through september see western power market issues for additional information 
in each regulatory jurisdiction  rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are currently determined on a cost of service basis and are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses  an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on rate base 
rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost net of accumulated depreciation of utility plant in service  subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items 
over time  rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation of utility plant 
as the energy business is restructured  traditional cost of service ratemaking may evolve into some other form of ratemaking 
rates for transmission services are based on the cost of service principles and are set forth in tariffs on file with the ferc

power cost deferrals in august  the wutc approved avista utilities request for deferred accounting treatment for certain power costs related to  among other things  increases in short term wholesale electric prices from july  through june  avista utilities is permitted to defer the recognition in the income statement of the portion of power supply costs that is in excess of the level currently recovered from retail customers 
deferred power supply costs are recorded as a deferred charge on the balance sheet for future review and the opportunity for recovery through retail 
table of contents avista corporation rates 
the specific power costs deferred include the changes in power costs to avista utilities from the costs included in base retail rates  related to changes in short term wholesale market prices  changes in the level of hydroelectric generation and changes in the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices 
in january  the wutc approved a modification to the deferral mechanism to recover power supply costs associated with meeting increased retail and wholesale system load requirements  effective december  in may  the wutc approved a settlement agreement reached among avista corp  the staff of the wutc and other parties with respect to deferred power costs 
the agreement  among other things  provided for the extension of avista corp 
s deferred accounting mechanism through february during june and the first part of july of  avista utilities evaluated the effect of several significant developments that changed its plans for the recovery of deferred power costs 
these developments included a decline in hydroelectric availability  the increased cost of energy and capacity to meet retail and wholesale demand for and a decline in wholesale market prices 
as such  avista utilities determined that its plan for recovery of deferred cost balances  as contemplated in the may settlement agreement with the wutc and the existing pca with the ipuc  was not feasible 
accordingly  in july avista utilities filed requests with the wutc and ipuc for the approval of an electric energy surcharge of percent in washington and a pca surcharge of percent in idaho for a month period beginning in september in september  the wutc ordered a percent temporary electric rate surcharge for the month period from october  to december  applied uniformly across all washington electric customer classes 
as part of the surcharge order  the wutc ordered avista utilities to file a general rate case by december the order by the wutc also provided for the termination of the accounting mechanism for the deferral of power costs effective december  the wutc subsequently approved the continuation of the accounting mechanism for deferred power costs for the period from january  through the conclusion of the general rate case 
in november  avista utilities filed a request with the wutc for an expedited procedural schedule to address the prudence and recoverability of deferred power costs incurred as of september  in march  the wutc issued an order approving the prudence and recoverability of percent of deferred power supply costs incurred during the period from july  through december  this resulted in the company expensing million of power supply costs previously deferred 
in october  the ipuc issued an order approving a percent pca surcharge for idaho electric customers and granted an extension of a percent pca surcharge implemented earlier in that was to expire january  both pca surcharges will remain in effect until october  the ipuc directed avista utilities to file a status report days before the pca surcharge expires 
if review of the status report and the actual balance of deferred power costs support continuation of the pca surcharge  the ipuc has indicated that it anticipates the pca surcharge would be extended for an additional period 
the current pca mechanism allows for the deferral of percent of the difference between actual net power supply expenses and the authorized level of net power supply expense approved in the last idaho general rate case 
as of december   total deferred power costs were million  including million in washington and million in idaho 
in  revenue collected under the washington and idaho surcharges totaled million and deferred power costs were further reduced million through the amortization of a deferred non cash credit 
based on current projections  total deferred power costs balances are expected to be approximately million at the end of and fully recovered by see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters for additional information 
general rate cases in october  avista utilities filed with the wutc a request for a general electric rate increase of million  or percent  subsequently revised to million  and a general natural gas rate increase of million  or percent 
in september  the wutc ordered a million  or percent  reduction in electric rates and a million  or percent  increase in natural gas rates 
the wutc also ordered that avista utilities overall rate of return for both electricity and natural gas be reduced from percent to percent 
avista utilities had requested a percent overall rate of return 
avista utilities filed a petition for reconsideration with the wutc requesting that the commission reconsider certain portions of its order 
in november  the commission slightly modified the original order  reducing the electric reduction from million to million and increasing the natural gas increase from million to million 

table of contents avista corporation on december   the company filed a general electric rate case with the wutc  as ordered by the wutc in september issues to be addressed include  among other things  the recovery of cash outlays for increased power supply costs and expenses related to building additional generation 
the rate case requested by avista corp 
proposes a percent overall rate of return 
the wutc may take up to months to review the general rate case filing 
in the rate case filing with the wutc  avista corp 
requested an interim rate increase of percent or million in annual revenues above current rates including the percent temporary surcharge approved by the wutc in september discussed above 
in march  the wutc ordered an increase to base retail rates of percent or million in annual revenues 
the order also modified the temporary electric surcharge such that one fifth of the existing percent surcharge will be applied to offset the company s general operating costs and the remainder will continue to be applied as a recovery of deferred power costs 
in the general rate case filing  the company requested that a number of adjustments be made that would result in no net change to rates above the interim rate increase 
the company requested that once the interim rate increase ends  base electric rates would increase by percent or million in annual revenues and the electric surcharge would be reduced from percent to percent 
these rate increases are necessary in order to continue the recovery of deferred power costs 
the proposed rate increases also reflect  among other things  the recovery of costs associated with the addition of the company s percent ownership in the coyote springs power plant and the construction of two small generation projects built to serve retail customer needs 
in the general rate case  avista corp 
requested the implementation of a temporary accounting mechanism for the deferral of power supply costs incurred in excess of the amount recovered through rates effective january  until the conclusion of the general rate case 
the wutc approved this request on december  in the general rate case  avista corp 
requested the establishment of a permanent pca mechanism to increase or decrease future electric rates based on actual power supply costs  similar to the idaho pca mechanism that allows for the deferral of percent of the difference between actual net power supply costs and the authorized level of net power supply costs 
in avista utilities last general electric rate case in idaho  the ipuc granted a rate increase of million  or percent  with an authorized rate of return of percent  effective august purchased gas adjustment pga or natural gas trackers natural gas trackers are supplemental tariffs filed with state regulatory commissions designed to pass through changes in purchased natural gas costs  and do not normally result in any changes in net income 
in july  avista utilities filed requests for pgas with the wutc and the ipuc 
both the washington pga increase of percent approved by the wutc and the idaho pga increase of percent approved by the ipuc became effective in august avista utilities estimates these pga rate changes will increase revenues by million for approximately one year 
total deferred natural gas costs were million as of december  based on current pgas in place and current natural gas prices  avista utilities expects that the deferred natural gas cost balance will be fully recovered by december natural gas benchmark mechanism avista utilities received regulatory approval of its natural gas benchmark mechanism in from the ipuc  wutc and opuc 
the mechanism eliminated natural gas procurement operations within avista utilities for these jurisdictions and consolidated gas procurement operations under avista energy  the company s non regulated affiliate 
the ownership of the natural gas assets remains with avista utilities  however  avista energy through an agency agreement with avista utilities manages the assets 
avista utilities maintains a natural gas staff to prepare load forecasts and analyses related to long term resource acquisitions  to manage the agency agreement with avista energy and to support state and federal regulatory activities 
consolidation of natural gas procurement operations under avista energy allows the company to gain synergies and better manage its risk by combining and operating the two portfolios as a single portfolio and to gain efficiencies by eliminating duplicate functions 
effective january   the wutc and ipuc approved avista utilities modifications to the natural gas benchmark mechanism  incorporating the use of financial products fixed price transactions or hedging 
due to the unprecedented increase in and volatility of natural gas commodity costs  it was determined that such additional flexibility was needed in the natural gas benchmark mechanism to properly manage costs 
the natural gas benchmark mechanism provides certain guaranteed benefits to retail customers and provides the company with the opportunity to improve earnings a performance based mechanism 
avista utilities provided notice of its intent to continue the natural gas benchmark mechanism and related agency agreement with avista energy to the applicable state regulatory agencies in in early  the wutc approved the continuation of the natural gas benchmark mechanism and related agency agreement through march  and the ipuc approved the continuation through march  the opuc is expected to make its ruling in late march 
table of contents avista corporation demand side management dsm and low income assistance programs dsm programs are designed to encourage conservation of energy 
in february  the wutc and the ipuc approved avista utilities implementation of a natural gas revenue surcharge of percent to provide funding for natural gas energy efficiency programs 
avista utilities currently has electric revenue surcharges  or tariff riders  of approximately percent in washington and idaho to fund its electric dsm programs 
the tariff rider has been in place since and was the first system benefit charge for energy efficiency in the united states 
effective may  the wutc approved an increase in electric and natural gas surcharges  or tariff rider  of percent to supplement the community action agency s existing federal and state low income heating energy assistance program and project share funds 
the annual revenue of approximately million funds eastern washington agencies assistance to help in need customers pay their energy bills 
industry restructuring federal level industry restructuring to open the electric wholesale energy market to competition was initially promoted by federal legislation 
the energy policy act of energy act amended provisions of the public utility holding company act of puhca and the federal power act to remove certain barriers to a competitive wholesale market 
the energy act expanded the authority of the ferc to issue orders requiring electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  and to require electric utilities to enlarge or construct additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services 
it also created exempt wholesale generators  a new class of independent power plant owners that are able to sell generation only at the wholesale level 
this permits public utilities and other entities to participate through subsidiaries in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers without being required to register under the puhca 
ferc order no 
 issued in april  requires public utilities operating under the federal power act to provide access to their transmission systems to third parties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ferc s pro forma open access transmission tariff 
ferc order no 
 the companion rule to order no 
 requires public utilities to establish an open access same time information system oasis to provide transmission customers with information about available transmission capacity and other information by electronic means 
it also requires each public utility subject to the rule to functionally separate its transmission and wholesale power merchant functions 
the ferc issued its initial order accepting the non rate terms and conditions of avista utilities open access transmission tariff in november avista utilities filed its procedures for implementing standards of conduct under ferc order no 
with the ferc in december and adopted these procedures effective january ferc orders no 
and no 
have not had a material effect on avista utilities operating results 
avista corp 
and three other western utilities have taken steps toward the formation of a for profit independent transmission company itc  transconnect  which would serve portions of six states 
transconnect would be a member of the planned regional transmission organization  rto west  a non profit entity  and it would own or lease the high voltage transmission facilities currently held by avista corp  portland general electric co  nevada power co 
and sierra pacific power co 
a proposal was filed in october in response to the ferc s order no 
 which requires utilities subject to ferc regulation to file a proposal to form a regional transmission organization rto  or a description of efforts to participate in an rto  and any existing obstacles to rto participation 
in april  the ferc issued the rto west transconnect order granting  with modifications  the participating companies petition 
avista corp 
is actively evaluating this order to determine the effects of the modifications and the impact to the potential development of transconnect 
transconnect filed its proposal with ferc in november avista corp 
only joined in the planning protocol modified governance for this filing 
the final proposal must be approved by the ferc  the boards of directors of the filing companies and regulators in various states 
the companies decision to move forward with the formation of transconnect or rto west will ultimately depend on the conditions related to the formation of the entities  as well as the economics and conditions imposed in the regulatory approval process 
if transconnect were formed  it could result in avista utilities divesting million of electric transmission assets 
the north american electric reliability council and the wscc have undertaken initiatives to establish a series of security coordinators to oversee the reliable operation of the regional transmission system 
accordingly  avista utilities  in cooperation with other utilities in the pacific northwest  established the pacific northwest security coordinator pnsc  which oversees daily and short term operations of the northwest sub regional transmission grid and has limited authority to direct certain actions of control area operators in the case of a pending transmission system emergency 
avista utilities executed its service agreement with the pnsc in september 
table of contents avista corporation state level further competition may be introduced by state action 
competition for retail customers is not generally allowed in avista utilities service territory 
while the energy act precludes the ferc from mandating retail wheeling  state regulators and legislators could open service territories to full competition at the retail level 
legislative action at the state level would be required for full retail wheeling and customer choice to occur in washington and idaho 
for the past several years  the legislatures and public utility commissions in washington and idaho have conducted a series of hearings and several studies regarding electric industry restructuring 
issues such as unbundling  deregulation  reliability and consumer protection were examined 
impacts on customer service quality and system reliability generation  transmission and distribution were considered on a macro basis under various restructuring scenarios 
public policy makers in washington and idaho continue to examine other states experiences with restructuring  while cognizant that the pacific northwest generally benefits from the lowest electric rates in the country 
although there is currently no action surrounding deregulation in washington or idaho  activities related to california s deregulation have affected wholesale power prices in the western united states  including the company s service territory

an initiative was presented in november in montana to create a public agency to own and operate all hydroelectric generating facilities within the state 
avista utilities largest generation plant  noxon rapids  is located in montana on the clark fork river 
if this proposed initiative obtains the required signatures by june  and is passed into law in the november general election  noxon rapids could be acquired from the company either through a negotiated sale or at fair market value through a condemnation proceeding 
this could have significant negative ramifications for the company 
as such  the company intends to vigorously oppose this initiative and intends to legally defend itself against the acquisition of noxon rapids 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
environmental issues the company is subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which avista utilities has an ownership interest were designed to comply with all applicable environmental laws 
furthermore  the company conducts periodic reviews of all its facilities and operations to respond to or anticipate emerging environmental issues 
the company s board of directors has an environmental committee to deal specifically with these issues 
air quality the most significant impact on the company related to the clean air act caa and the clear air act amendments caaa pertains to colstrip  which is a phase ii coal fired plant under the caaa 
colstrip is not expected to be required to implement any additional sulfur dioxide so mitigation in the foreseeable future in order to continue operations 
avista utilities other thermal projects are subject to various caaa standards 
every five years each project requires an updated operating permit known as a title v permit which addresses  among other things  the compliance of the plant with the caaa 
the operating permit for the rathdrum ct was issued in december during  the company applied to renew the operating permit for the kettle falls plant and applied for an upgrade to a title v permit for the natural gas fired cts located in spokane 
the company anticipates the receipt of these operating permits during the second quarter of additionally  the company received operating permits for several small generation projects during due to the decline in wholesale market prices during the second half of  avista utilities reevaluated the cost of the small generation units and will not operate as many of the units as originally planned 
during  avista corp 
extended the operating hours of the northeast ct with an agreement with the spokane county air pollution control authority scapca under a special operating order called an assurance of discontinuance aod 
the scapca has allowed for continued operation of the northeast ct upon the condition of a payment of for each hour of operation paid into a mitigation fund for assistance to low income customers and the payment of  for each day of operation to fund an environmental offset project 
the aod allows avista utilities to use the northeast ct to temporarily bring on added generating capacity for the benefit of its customers and the region during a time of increased energy demand and limited energy resources 
extended operation of the northeast ct was approved after the scapca determined  through air emission modeling and projections  that extended operation of the turbine would not adversely impact air quality 
the funding of the environmental offset project will be paid until such time as a new operating permit is issued by the scapca 
the company submitted its permit application for permanent operation of the northeast ct in november see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future outlook and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

table of contents avista corporation western power market issues avista utilities and avista energy are directly and indirectly involved with issues surrounding western power markets  including the california market 
in early  california s two largest utilities  southern california edison sce and pacific gas electric company pg e  defaulted on payment obligations owed to various energy sellers  including the california power exchange calpx  california independent system operator caliso  and automated power exchange apx 
calpx  caliso and apx defaulted on their payment obligations to avista energy 
pg e and calpx filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code for protection from creditors 
sce has remained outside of bankruptcy 
the ferc issued an order in august initiating hearing proceedings under section of the federal power act to address matters affecting bulk power markets and wholesale energy prices including volatile price fluctuations in california 
in november the ferc proposed specific remedies to address dysfunctions in california s wholesale bulk markets and to ensure just and reasonable wholesale power rates by public utility sellers in california 
the ferc denied requested refunds from sellers of electric power for sales prior to october  and held that sales made after october  are subject to refund  with the level and extent of any refund to be determined in future orders 
in april  the ferc issued a price mitigation order that affected the caliso spot market 
in june  the ferc expanded its price mitigation plan for the california spot market to hours a day  seven days a week and broadened the price curbs to the eleven state western region through september since june  spot market prices have remained below the ferc imposed caps 
earlier in  the governor of california invoked emergency executive powers to seize certain power contracts called block forward contracts between the calpx and  respectively  pg e and sce after pg e s and sce s defaults 
the block forward contracts would have been significant assets of the calpx bankruptcy estate if they had not been so removed by the governor 
pg e  sce  the calpx creditors committee  and certain individual creditors filed suits separately against the state of california for compensation related to the seized block forward contracts 
in september  the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that wholesale energy suppliers are entitled to injunctive relief from the state of california 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of this claim against the state of california 
in july  the ferc issued an order to commence a fact finding hearing to determine amounts to be refunded for sales during the period from october  to june  in the california spot market operated by the caliso and the calpx 
the order provides that any refunds owed could be offset against unpaid energy debts due to the same party 
the ferc schedule for this proceeding has been postponed repeatedly and is not expected to be continued until august or later 
avista energy is participating in this proceeding pursuant to the ferc order and cannot predict its outcome at this time 
the july ferc order also directed a separate evidentiary proceeding to explore wholesale power market issues in the pacific northwest 
the ferc s pacific northwest proceeding seeks to determine whether there were excessive charges for spot market sales in the pacific northwest in the period december  to june   and whether there is sufficient factual basis for the ferc to take further action 
based on their application of selected retroactive pricing methods  certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds from avista energy and lesser refunds from avista utilities 
avista energy and avista utilities joined with numerous other wholesale market participants to vigorously oppose proposals for retroactive price caps and refund claims 
in september  the ferc s administrative law judge for this proceeding issued a recommendation that the ferc should not order refunds for the pacific northwest for the period in question and that the ferc should take no further action on these matters 
the ferc has not yet issued a decision in the pacific northwest refund proceeding 
in september  pg e filed a plan of reorganization that provides for payment to all creditors on or around january  the pg e plan requires various approvals  including procedural and content matters  by the federal bankruptcy court  securities and exchange commission  nuclear regulatory commission  and the ferc 
various parties  including consumer groups and the cpuc  have announced opposition to the plan of reorganization 
the cpuc filed a term sheet in february outlining an alternative plan of reorganization 
on february   the federal bankruptcy court ruled that the cpuc would be permitted to file its full plan  which it must do by april  the cpuc term sheet estimates that creditors would be paid in or around january in october  sce and the cpuc announced a settlement of sce s filed rate doctrine lawsuit

and not a separate entity  represents the regulated utility operations 
avista capital  a wholly owned subsidiary of avista corp  is the parent company of all of the subsidiary companies engaged in the other non regulated lines of business 
as of december   the company had common equity investments of million and million in avista utilities and avista capital  respectively 
avista utilities generates  transmits and distributes electricity and distributes natural gas 
avista utilities owns and operates eight hydroelectric projects  a wood waste fueled generating station and a two unit natural gas fired combustion turbine ct generating facility 
it also owns a percent share in a two unit coal fired generating facility and leases and operates a two unit natural gas fired ct generating facility 
these facilities have a total net capability of approximately  megawatts  of which percent is hydroelectric and percent is thermal 
in addition to company owned resources  avista utilities has a number of long term power purchase and exchange contracts that increase its available resources 
avista utilities sells and purchases electric capacity and energy to and from utilities and other entities in the wholesale market under long term contracts having terms of more than one year 
in addition  avista utilities engages in an ongoing process of resource optimization which involves short term purchases and sales in the wholesale market in pursuit of an economic selection of resources to serve retail and wholesale loads 
avista utilities makes continuing projections of future retail and wholesale loads based on  among other things  forward estimates of factors such as customer usage and weather as well as historical data and contract terms and resource availability based on  among other things  estimates of streamflows  generating unit availability  historic and forward market information and experience 
on the basis of these continuing projections  avista utilities makes purchases and sales of energy on a quarterly  monthly  daily and hourly basis to match actual resources to actual energy requirements and to sell any surplus at the best available price 
this process includes hedging transactions 
during a year having normal water conditions  avista utilities would expect to have generation from its hydroelectric resources both owned and purchased under long term hydroelectric contracts of approximately average megawatts amw 
in a critical water year defined by the northwest power pool as the worst water conditions on record  avista utilities would expect hydroelectric production of amw  amw below normal 
average hydroelectric production for the year was amw percent of normal  which is amw below normal and the lowest level in the years in which records have been kept 
preliminary forecasts indicate streamflow conditions are expected to be percent of normal in based on current snow pack conditions

during  the company decided that avista power would no longer pursue the development of additional non regulated generation projects 
the information and technology line of business is comprised of avista advantage  inc avista advantage and avista laboratories  inc 
avista labs 
avista advantage is a provider of internet based facility intelligence  cost management billing and information services to retail customers throughout north america 
its primary product 
table of contents avista corporation lines include consolidated billing  resource accounting  energy analysis  load profiling and maintenance and repair billing services 
avista labs developed a unique modular proton exchange membrane pem fuel cell that delivers reliable  affordable and clean distributed power solutions 
in addition to its pem fuel cell  avista labs seeks to commercialize selected components to complement its fuel cell in order to deliver system solutions to industrial  commercial and residential markets 
the other line of business includes avista ventures  inc avista ventures  avista capital parent company only amounts  pentzer corporation pentzer and several other minor subsidiaries 
during  the focus of this line of business was changed from investing in a broad range of middle market companies to investing in business opportunities that have potential value to the company s energy related businesses 
currently  activities in this line of business are not significant and the company intends to limit its future investment in this line of business 
avista communications  inc avista communications provided local dial tone  data transport  internet services  voice messaging and other telecommunications services to several communities in the western united states 
in september  avista corp 
decided that it would dispose of substantially all of the assets of avista communications 
as such  these operations are reported as a discontinued operation 
avista corp 
began its divestiture of this business during the fourth quarter of  and the divestiture is expected to be completed during the first half of avista utilities regulatory matters beginning in the second quarter of  the price of power in the wholesale markets of the western united states increased considerably and became much more volatile 
while prices and volatility decreased during the second half of  the effects of contracts entered during the period of high wholesale prices continue to have a significant impact on avista corp 
s financial condition and results of operations 
in the second half of and continuing through  avista utilities was required to purchase above normal amounts of power in the wholesale market to meet its retail demand 
this was primarily due to the reduced availability of hydroelectric resources as a result of low streamflow conditions 
the combination of high wholesale market prices and increased amounts required to be purchased increased power supply costs to amounts far in excess of the amounts recovered from retail customers under current rates 
under current orders and approvals from the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the idaho public utilities commission ipuc  avista utilities is permitted to defer the recognition in the income statement of percent of power supply costs that are in excess of the level currently recovered from retail customers 
deferred power supply costs are recorded as a deferred charge on the balance sheet for future review and the opportunity for recovery through retail rates 
the specific power costs deferred include the changes in power costs to avista utilities from the costs included in base retail rates  related to changes in short term wholesale market prices  changes in the level of hydroelectric generation and changes in the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices 
the power costs deferred relate solely to the operation of avista utilities system resources to serve its retail and wholesale load obligations 
in december  the company filed a general rate case with the wutc to address  among other things  the recovery of cash outlays for increased power supply costs and expenses related to building additional generation 
the wutc may take up to months to review the general rate case filing 
avista corp 
requested an interim rate increase of percent or million in annual revenues above current rates including the percent temporary surcharge approved by the wutc in september 
at the conclusion of the general rate case  avista corp 
requested that a number of adjustments be made that would result in no net change to rates above the interim rate increase 
the interim rate increase would end  base electric rates would increase by percent or million in annual revenues and the electric surcharge would be reduced from percent to percent 
these rate increases are necessary in order to continue the recovery of deferred power costs 
the proposed rate increases also reflect  among other things  the recovery of costs associated with the addition of the company s percent ownership in the coyote springs power plant and the addition of several small generation projects built to serve retail customer needs 
the general rate case proposed by avista corp 
requests a percent rate of return on common equity and a percent overall rate of return 
in the december general rate case filing  avista corp 
requested the implementation of a temporary accounting mechanism for the deferral of power costs incurred in excess of the amount recovered through rates effective january  until the conclusion of the general rate case 
the wutc approved this request in december in the general rate case  avista corp 
requested the establishment of a permanent power cost adjustment pca mechanism to increase or decrease future electric rates based on actual power supply costs  similar to the existing idaho pca 
table of contents avista corporation mechanism 
this provides for the deferral of percent of the difference between actual net power supply costs and the amount of power supply costs authorized in current rates 
in march  the wutc issued an order approving a settlement agreement reached among avista corp  the staff of the wutc and other parties 
this order approves the prudence and recoverability of percent or million of deferred power supply costs incurred by the company during the period from july  through december  this resulted in the company recording as an expense an additional million in power supply costs for the year ended december  additionally  the wutc order provides that the collection of the percent temporary electric surcharge  approved by the wutc in september  will no longer be subject to refund 
the order also modified the temporary electric surcharge such that one fifth or approximately million in annual revenues of the existing percent surcharge will be applied to offset the company s general operating costs and the remainder approximately million in annual revenues will continue to be applied as a recovery of deferred power costs 
the wutc also ordered a percent or million in annual revenues increase in base electric rates for washington customers 
both the percent increase in base electric rates and one fifth of the temporary surcharge will increase net income 
as of december   total deferred power costs were million  including million in washington and million in idaho 
based on current projections  total deferred power costs balances are expected to be approximately million at the end of and fully recovered by the following table shows activity in deferred power costs for washington and idaho during dollars in thousands washington idaho total deferred power costs as of december  activity from january september  power costs deferred interest and other net additions recovery of deferred power costs deferred power costs as of september  activity from october december  power costs deferred mark to market loss interest and other net additions amortization of deferred credit recovery of deferred power costs write off deferred power costs deferred power costs as of december  the following discussion details significant developments during the second half of and the year leading to the march wutc orders and the december general electric rate case filing 
in august  the wutc approved avista utilities request for deferred accounting treatment for certain power costs related to  among other things  increases in short term wholesale electric prices beginning july  through june  in january  the wutc approved a modification to the deferral mechanism to recover power supply costs associated with meeting increased retail and wholesale system load requirements  effective december  the approval of the modification was conditioned on avista utilities filing by march a proposal addressing the prudence of the incurred power costs  the optimization of company owned resources to the benefit of retail customers and the appropriateness of recovery of power costs through a deferral mechanism 
this proposal was also to address cost of capital offsets to recognize the shift in risk from shareholders to ratepayers and avista utilities plan to mitigate the deferred power costs 
in may  the wutc approved a settlement agreement reached among avista corp  the staff of the wutc and other parties with respect to deferred power costs 
the agreement  among other things  provided for the extension of avista corp 
s deferral accounting mechanism through february due to the planned addition of generating resources as well as the expiration of certain long term power sale agreements  avista utilities  at the time of the settlement agreement  expected to be in a power surplus position by the middle of the agreement was based  in part  on the expectation that avista utilities profits from surplus power sales would offset the deferred power cost balance  reducing the balance to zero by the end of february without any rate increase to retail customers 
these expectations were based on assumptions as to a number of variables including  but not limited to  streamflow conditions  thermal plant performance  level of retail loads  wholesale market prices and the amount of additional generating resources 
avista utilities reserved the right to alter  amend  or terminate the settlement agreement as 
table of contents avista corporation well as the right to seek interim rate relief 
as discussed below  subsequent events and conditions changed avista utilities original expectations and plans 
in response to the dramatically reduced generation from hydroelectric facilities commencing in the second quarter of  avista utilities was required to make additional fixed price purchases of energy to meet its retail and wholesale electric requirements for on the higher cost short term wholesale market 
in june  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued an order adopting a price mitigation plan applicable to certain wholesale power sales in california and throughout the western united states during the period june  through september  the order applies to pre schedule day ahead and real time hour ahead transactions in the western united states 
wholesale market prices in the western united states decreased considerably after the price caps were imposed and prices remained well below the price cap levels through the end of the decrease in wholesale market prices affected avista utilities plan for recovery of deferred power costs through future surplus power sales 
during june and the first part of july  avista utilities evaluated the effect of the recent decline in wholesale market prices and the ferc price mitigation plan on its ability to recover deferred power cost balances under the settlement agreement approved by the wutc in may and the continuing pca mechanism for idaho customers approved by the ipuc 
the decline in forward wholesale prices and the ferc price mitigation plan reduced the expected value from future surplus sales of energy 
in addition  low hydroelectric availability combined with the high cost of energy and capacity under forward contracts entered to meet customer demand for increased current and estimated future deferred power costs to levels significantly higher than originally anticipated 
as such  avista utilities determined that the plan for recovery of deferred power cost balances  as contemplated in the may  settlement agreement with the wutc and the existing pca with the ipuc  was not feasible 
accordingly  in july avista utilities filed requests with the wutc and ipuc for the approval of an electric energy surcharge of percent in washington and a pca surcharge of percent in idaho for a month period beginning in september in september  the wutc ordered a percent temporary electric rate surcharge for the month period from october  to december  applied uniformly to energy charges across all washington electric customer classes 
the march wutc order amended the surcharge such that one fifth will be applied to offset the company s general operating costs and the remainder will continue to be applied as a recovery of deferred power costs 
it was originally estimated the order would allow avista utilities to reduce the deferred power cost balance by million 
this included the receipt of million in additional revenue from the surcharge million was received during and the accelerated amortization of million of a deferred non cash credit on the company s balance sheet in october the deferred non cash credit related to funds received in december for the monetization of a contract in which the company assigned and transferred certain rights under a long term power sales contract with portland general electric pge to a funding trust 
the deferred non cash credit balance was originally to be amortized into revenues over the year period of the long term sales contract 
there is no direct impact on net income from either the surcharge or accelerated amortization of the deferred non cash credit  however  the surcharge revenue increases cash flows 
as part of the surcharge order  the wutc ordered avista utilities to file a general rate case by december as discussed above 
the order by the wutc also provided for the termination of the accounting mechanism for the deferral of power costs effective december  the wutc subsequently approved the continuation of the accounting mechanism for deferred power costs for the period from january  through the conclusion of the general rate case 
as requested by avista utilities  the deferred power cost accounting mechanism was modified to reflect the deferral of percent of the difference between actual power supply costs and the amount of power supply costs allowed to be recovered in current retail rates 
in october  the ipuc issued an order approving a percent pca surcharge for idaho electric customers and granted an extension of a percent pca surcharge implemented earlier in that was to expire january both pca surcharges will remain in effect until october the ipuc directed avista utilities to file a status report days before the pca surcharge expires 
if review of the status report and the actual balance of deferred power costs support continuation of the pca surcharge  the ipuc has indicated that it anticipates the pca surcharge will be extended for an additional period 
it is currently estimated the ipuc order will allow avista utilities to reduce the deferred power cost balance by approximately million 
this includes the receipt of million in additional revenue from the pca surcharges million was received during the fourth quarter of and the accelerated amortization of million of a deferred non cash credit on the company s balance sheet for the 
table of contents avista corporation monetization of the power sales contract with pge million was amortized in 
there is no direct impact on net income from either the pca surcharges or accelerated amortization of the deferred non cash credit  however  the pca surcharges increase cash flows 
in november  avista utilities filed a request with the wutc for an expedited procedural schedule to address the prudence and recoverability of deferred power costs incurred as of september  the company made this request due to the fact that uncertainty involving the recovery of deferred power costs would present financing challenges for the company during the first half of the company s million committed line of credit as well as a million accounts receivable financing facility expire in may the company may also decide to issue equity securities during in march  the wutc approved the prudence and recoverability of percent of deferred power costs incurred as of december  as discussed above 
enron exposure on december   enron corporation enron and certain of its affiliates filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy filing constituted an event of default under contracts between avista corp 
and avista energy  respectively  and certain enron affiliates  enron power marketing  inc epmi  enron north america company ena and enron canada corp 
ecc  that are guaranteed by enron 
as a result  avista corp 
and avista energy terminated all but one of these contracts and suspended trading activities with most enron affiliates  short term  balance of the month deals with epmi are still being transacted through avista energy on a prepaid basis 
both avista corp 
and avista energy engage in physical and financial transactions for the purchase and sale of electric energy and capacity and natural gas 
both companies had done considerable business and had short term and long term contracts with enron affiliates 
avista corp 
has one three year purchase with remaining deliveries scheduled from to with epmi 
avista energy s long term contracts with enron affiliates were terminated entirely 
as of december   avista corp 
and avista energy had net accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  from enron affiliates 
the contracts of avista corp 
and avista energy with each enron affiliate provide that  upon termination  the net settlement of accounts receivable and accounts payable with such entity will be netted against the net mark to market value of the terminated forward contracts with such entity 
it is estimated that  for each of avista corp 
and avista energy  netting the mark to market liability against the defaulted net accounts receivable will result in no significant loss due to non collection from the enron affiliates 
it is further estimated that the net mark to market liability to enron affiliates in respect of terminated forward contracts of avista corp 
and avista energy  taken together  exceeds total net accounts receivable from these entities by less than million 
any claims by the enron entities for amounts that avista corp 
and avista energy might owe in respect of the terminated forward contracts would be subject to any defenses and counterclaims which avista corp 
and avista energy may have 
any residual obligation by avista corp 
or avista energy for termination payments is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates of the mark to market values of terminated forward contracts are based on available broker quotes  for the respective periods  and on assumptions as to future market prices and other information 
while avista corp 
and avista energy believe these assumptions are reasonable  they are subject to change and ultimately could be challenged by the enron entities or their bankruptcy trustees 
the mark to market value of terminated contracts has not been firmly established and could result in undercollection that is not expected to be material to the financial condition or results of operations of either avista corp 
or avista energy 
national energy production corporation nepco  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron  is the contractor responsible for the engineering  procurement and construction of the coyote springs project 
avista corp 
owns percent of the coyote springs project  which is expected to commence commercial operation in the third quarter of nepco was not included in the bankruptcy filings made by enron and its affiliates 
however  enron guaranteed nepco s obligations  and the bankruptcy filing by enron was an event of default under the coyote springs construction contract 
nepco and coyote springs  llc  an entity formed for the purpose of constructing the coyote spring plant  amended the construction contract to  among other things  authorize coyote springs  llc to make immediate draws under a letter of credit posted to secure nepco s performance and to permit coyote springs  llc to pay third party subcontractors of nepco directly 
coyote springs  llc is continuing to assess the ability of nepco to perform its obligations under the construction contract and may need to exercise additional remedies in the event the impact of the enron bankruptcy prevents nepco from performing its obligations under the construction contract

is party to a power exchange arrangement which expires in under this power exchange arrangement  epmi purchases capacity from avista corp 
and sells capacity to spokane energy llc spokane energy  a subsidiary of avista corp  formed in solely for the purpose of monetizing the long term capacity contract between pge and avista corp 
spokane energy sells the related capacity to pge  a subsidiary of enron that has not been included in the bankruptcy filing to date and is in the process of being sold to another company 
this power exchange arrangement was originally established for the purpose of monetizing a million long term capacity contract between avista corp 
and pge 
epmi assisted in setting up the monetization structure and acts as an intermediary to abide by certain regulatory restrictions that currently prevent spokane energy and avista corp 
from dealing directly with each other 
the transaction is structured such that spokane energy bears full recourse risk for a monetization loan balance of million as of december  that matures in january with no recourse to avista corp 
related to the loan 
epmi is obligated to pay approximately  per month to avista corp 
for its capacity purchase and servicing functions related to this power exchange arrangement 
epmi defaulted on two payments to avista corp 
prior to filing for bankruptcy 
as a result  in december  avista corp 
and epmi entered an agreement that allows avista corp 
to continue receiving the monthly payments from epmi while avista corp 
evaluates alternatives with respect to epmi s involvement in the transaction going forward 
western power market issues avista utilities and avista energy are directly and indirectly involved in the power markets in the western united states 
developments in these markets have impacted both avista utilities and avista energy 
federal and state officials  including the ferc and the california public utility commission cpuc  commenced reviews in to determine the causes of the changes in the wholesale energy markets to develop legal and regulatory remedies to address alleged market failures or abuses and large defaults by certain parties in the wholesale markets 
the ultimate outcome of these reviews and the resulting impact on the company cannot be predicted at this time 
in early  california s two largest utilities  southern california edison sce and pacific gas electric company pg e  defaulted on payment obligations owed to various energy sellers  including the california power exchange calpx  california independent system operator caliso  and automated power exchange apx 
calpx  caliso and apx defaulted on their payment obligations to avista energy 
pg e and calpx filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code for protection from creditors 
sce has not filed for bankruptcy protection 
as of december   avista energy s accounts receivable related to defaulting parties in california net of reserves for uncollected amounts  cost of collection  and refunds were approximately million 
avista energy is currently pursuing recovery for the defaulted obligations 
reserves for defaulted payments established in and accounted for the majority of the company s increase in the total allowance for doubtful accounts to million as of december  from million as of december  and million as of december  in april  the ferc issued a price mitigation order that affected the caliso spot market 
in june  the ferc expanded its price mitigation plan for the california spot market to hours a day  seven days a week and broadened the price caps to the eleven state western region 
since june  spot market prices have remained below the ferc imposed caps 
in july  the ferc issued an order to commence a fact finding hearing to determine amounts to be refunded for sales during the period from october  to june  in the california spot market 
the order provides that any refunds owed could be offset against unpaid energy debts due to the same party 
the ferc schedule for this proceeding has been postponed repeatedly and is not expected to be continued until august or later 
avista energy is participating in this proceeding pursuant to the ferc order and cannot predict its outcome at this time 
if retroactive price caps or refunds were imposed  avista energy could develop offsetting claims 
the july ferc order also directed an evidentiary proceeding to explore wholesale power market issues in the pacific northwest to determine whether there were excessive charges for spot market sales in the pacific northwest during the period from december  to june  based on their application of selected retroactive pricing methods  certain parties asserted claims for significant refunds from avista energy and lesser refunds from avista utilities 
avista energy and avista utilities joined with numerous other wholesale market participants to vigorously oppose proposals for retroactive price caps and refund claims 
in september  the ferc s administrative law judge for this proceeding issued a recommendation that the ferc should not order refunds for the pacific northwest for the period in question and that the ferc should take no further action on these matters 
the ferc has not yet issued a decision in the pacific northwest refund proceeding 
if retroactive price caps or refunds were imposed  avista utilities and avista energy could develop offsetting claims 
avista corp 
is participating with other utilities in the pacific northwest in the possible formation of a regional transmission organization rto  rto west  a non profit organization 
the potential formation of rto west is in response to a ferc order requiring all utilities subject to ferc regulation to file a proposal to form a rto  or a description of efforts to participate in a rto  and any existing obstacles to rto participation 
avista corp 
and three other western utilities have also taken steps toward the formation of a for profit independent transmission company  transconnect  which would be a member of rto west  serve portions of six states and own or lease the high voltage transmission facilities of the participating utilities 
transconnect filed its proposal with ferc in november the final proposal must be approved by the ferc  the boards of directors of the filing companies and regulators in various states 
the companies decision to move forward with the formation of transconnect or rto west will ultimately depend on the conditions related to the formation of the entities  as well as the economics and conditions imposed in the regulatory approval process 
if transconnect were formed  it could result in avista utilities divesting million of electric transmission assets

avista utilities also made certain short term sales at fixed prices that were offset by purchases at prices indexed to the market price at the time of delivery 
certain of these wholesale trading positions were outside normal operating guidelines 
avista utilities was required to buy additional power not only to meet its obligations to its retail and long term wholesale customers  but also to cover its wholesale trading positions 
an orderly process to complete the necessary power purchases was impeded by the rapid escalation of market prices and lack of liquidity in the power markets during the second quarter of these purchases were made at fixed prices significantly higher than the related selling prices and at index  which settled at unprecedented levels in june the pricing of these purchases caused the majority of avista utilities net loss for avista utilities short position was compounded by the may sale of its interest in the centralia power plant to transalta  which reduced its system capacity by megawatts 
based on historical trends and avista utilities views on power prices and availability of power for may and june  avista utilities did not seek to replace the centralia power plant generation for those two months with firm commitments 
avista utilities entered into a three and one half year contract to purchase megawatts from transalta beginning in july

wholesale electric revenues decreased million  or percent  while wholesale sales volumes decreased percent from  reflecting average sales prices that were percent higher than the prior year 
wholesale sales volumes decreased due to management s decision in to reduce power imbalance volume limits the difference between projected load obligations and projected resource availability 
this decision was based on the emergent market price volatility  and avista utilities strategy to focus primarily on energy transactions necessary to efficiently manage power resources to meet retail customer loads and wholesale obligations 
the extent of future wholesale transactions will be determined based on resource additions or changes and load obligations and contract commitments

also contributing to the decrease in cash flows from continuing operating activities was a decrease in net income 
net cash used in working capital components increased in compared to  with net cash used of million in compared to net cash provided by working capital components of million in decreased commodity prices and energy transactions that affected both avista utilities and avista energy were primarily responsible for the large changes in various working capital components  such as receivables and accounts payable 
significant changes in non cash items also include a million change in energy commodity assets and liabilities  primarily related to avista energy 
continuing investing activities net cash used in continuing investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in net cash used in continuing investing activities was primarily the result of increased capital expenditures in including million by the energy trading and marketing line of business

this condition  which was due to reduced availability of hydroelectric resources  increased prices in the wholesale market and increased volumes purchased to meet retail customer demand  has existed since the second quarter of in addition to operating expenses  the company has continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of facilities 
in  the company incurred substantial levels of indebtedness  both short and long term  to finance these requirements and to otherwise maintain adequate levels of working capital 
debt service is another significant cash requirement 
in addition  the company made significant cash investments to finance the development of companies in the information and technology line of business 
the temporary electric surcharge in washington and the pca surcharge in idaho  which were implemented during september and october  respectively  provide a basis for improving the company s liquidity

however  the company still needs to receive a favorable outcome in the washington general electric case filed in december in order to continue to improve liquidity 
see further description of issues related to deferred power costs in the section avista utilities regulatory matters 
if avista utilities purchased power and natural gas costs continue to exceed the levels recovered from retail customers  its cash flows will continue to be negatively affected 
factors that could cause purchased power costs to continue at higher levels than planned include  but are not limited to  a return to high prices in wholesale markets and continued high volumes of energy purchased in the wholesale markets 
factors beyond the company s control that could result in high volumes of energy purchased include increases in demand either due to weather or customer growth  low availability of hydroelectric resources  outages at generating facilities and failure of third parties to deliver on energy or capacity contracts 
total deferred natural gas costs were million as of december  in order to recover deferred natural gas costs  avista utilities received approval from the wutc and the ipuc for purchased gas cost adjustments during august avista utilities estimates these pga rate changes will increase revenues by million for approximately one year 
based on current pgas in place and current natural gas prices  avista utilities expects that the deferred natural gas cost balance will be fully recovered by december the company was not able to obtain conventional financing for the coyote springs project due to lenders concerns with regards to the level of deferred power costs and the corresponding effect on cash flows 
as a result  the company sold percent of the coyote springs project to mirant

capital resources the company has incurred significant indebtedness to support capital expenditures  to fund electric and natural gas costs that were in excess of the amount recovered currently through rates and to maintain working capital 
as of december   the company had total debt outstanding of  million 
in addition  the company needs to finance capital expenditures and obtain additional working capital from time to time 
the cash requirements to service the total amount of indebtedness  both short term and long term  could reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital  future acquisitions  deferred power and natural gas costs  dividends  other corporate requirements and capital expenditures 

table of contents avista corporation the company funds capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash and external financing 
the level of cash generated internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates depending on a variety of factors 
external financings and cash provided by operating activities remain the company s primary source of funds for operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures 
in and subsequent years  the company expects cash flows from operations to improve primarily from the recovery of deferred power and natural gas costs 
this should allow the company to reduce total debt outstanding 
capital expenditures are financed on an interim basis with short term borrowings

in august  the company determined that it would not be in compliance with the fixed charge coverage covenant for the period ending september  or for any subsequent period through the termination date of the agreement 
accordingly  in september  avista corp 
requested  and obtained  a waiver of this covenant through the termination date of the agreement 
as a result of this waiver  the failure to comply with this covenant does not constitute an event of default under the agreement 
additionally  avista corp 
secured the committed line of credit with first mortgage bonds in connection with this waiver 
any default on its committed line of credit or other financing arrangements could result in cross defaults to other agreements and could induce vendors and other counterparties to demand collateral 
in the event of default  it would be virtually impossible for the company to obtain financing on any reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations  and the company would likely be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock

future outlook business strategy avista utilities seeks to maintain a strong  low cost and efficient electric and natural gas utility business focused on providing reliable  high quality service to its customers 
the utility business is expected to grow modestly  consistent with historical trends 
expansion will primarily result from economic growth in its service territory 
it is avista utilities strategy to own or control a sufficient amount of resources to meet its retail and wholesale electric requirements on an average annual basis 
during  avista energy scaled back its operations regionally to work primarily within the wscc and has focused on reducing the size and the risk associated with its energy trading and marketing activities 
avista energy s marketing efforts are expected to be driven by its base of knowledge and experience in the operation of both electric energy and natural gas physical systems in the wscc  as well as its relationship focused approach to its customers 
during  the company decided that avista power would no longer pursue the development of additional non regulated generation plants 
the company intends to find equity partners to assist in financing the continued growth of the information and technology businesses  avista advantage and avista labs 
the company plans to dispose or phase out of assets and operations that are not related to its energy operations 
competition avista utilities competes to provide service to new retail electric customers with various rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to its service territories 
alternate sources of power may compete for sales to existing avista utilities customers  including new market entrants as a result of deregulation 
competition for available electric resources has become more critical to utilities as surplus power resources were absorbed by load growth 
avista utilities natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy sources but natural gas continues to maintain a price advantage compared to heating oil  propane and other fuels  provided that the natural gas distribution system is proximate to prospective customers 

table of contents avista corporation the avista capital subsidiaries  particularly the information and technology companies  are subject to competition as they develop products and services and enter new markets 
competition from other companies in these emerging industries may mean challenges for a company to be the first to market a new product or service to gain the advantage in market share 
in order for these new businesses to grow as planned  one significant challenge will be the availability of funding and resources to meet the capital needs 
other challenges will be rapidly advancing technologies  possibly making some of the current technology quickly obsolete  and requiring continual research and development for product advancement 
in order for some of these subsidiaries to succeed  they will need to reduce costs of these emerging technologies to make them affordable to future customers 
business risk the company s operations are exposed to risks  including legislative and governmental regulations  the price and supply of purchased power  fuel and natural gas  recovery of purchased power and purchased natural gas costs  weather conditions  availability of generation facilities  competition  technology and availability of funding 
as described under avista corp 
lines of business  hydroelectric conditions in were significantly below normal  leading to greater than normal reliance on purchased power 
the earnings impact of these factors is mitigated by regulatory mechanisms that are intended to defer increased costs for recovery in future periods 
in order to recover deferred power costs  the wutc approved a temporary percent electric rate surcharge to washington customers in september and the ipuc approved a total of a percent pca surcharge to idaho customers in october in december  the company filed a general rate case with the wutc 
in march  the wutc issued an order approving the prudence and recoverability of percent or million of deferred power supply costs incurred by the company during the period from july  through december  avista utilities is not able to fully predict how the combination of energy resources  energy loads  prices  rate recovery and other factors will ultimately drive deferred costs and the timing of recovery of these costs in future periods 
current estimates and projections by the company indicate that deferred power costs would be recovered by see further information at avista utilities regulatory matters 
challenges facing avista utilities electric operations include  among other things  the ability to recover deferred power supply costs and the timing of such recovery  changes in the availability of and volatility in the prices of power and fuel  generating unit availability  legislative and governmental regulations  and weather conditions 
avista utilities believes it faces minimal risk for stranded utility assets resulting from deregulation  due to its relatively low cost generation portfolio and because of the slower and more cautious approach to regulatory changes in washington and idaho 
in a deregulated environment  however  evolving technologies that provide alternate energy supplies could affect the market price of power  and certain generating assets could have capital and operating costs above the prevailing market prices 
natural gas commodity prices increased dramatically during and remained at relatively high levels during the first half of before declining in the second half of the year 
market prices for natural gas continue to be competitive compared to alternative fuel sources for residential  commercial and industrial customers 
avista utilities believes that natural gas should sustain its market advantage based on the levels of existing reserves and potential natural gas development in the future 
growth has occurred in the natural gas business in recent years due to increased demand for natural gas in new construction  as well as conversions from electric space and water heating to natural gas 
challenges facing avista utilities natural gas operations include  among other things  volatility in the price of natural gas  changes in the availability of natural gas  legislative and governmental regulations  weather conditions  conservation and the timing for recovery of increased commodity costs 
avista utilities natural gas business also faces the potential for large natural gas customers to by pass its natural gas system 
to reduce the potential for such by pass  avista utilities prices its natural gas services  including transportation contracts  competitively and has varying degrees of flexibility to price its transportation and delivery rates by means of individual contracts 
avista utilities has long term transportation contracts with seven of its largest industrial customers  which reduces the risks of these customers by passing the system in the foreseeable future 
avista energy trades electricity and natural gas  along with derivative commodity instruments  including futures  options  swaps and other contractual arrangements 
as a result of these trading activities  avista energy is subject to various risks  including commodity price risk and credit risk  as well as possible new risks resulting from the recent imposition of market controls by federal and state agencies 
the ferc is conducting separate proceedings related to market controls within california and within the pacific northwest that include proposals by certain parties to retroactively impose price caps 
as a result  certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds from avista energy and lesser refunds from avista utilities which could result in liabilities for refunding revenues recognized in 
table of contents avista corporation prior periods 
avista energy and avista utilities have joined other parties in vigorously opposing these proposals 
if retroactive price caps were imposed  avista energy could develop offsetting claims 
in connection with matching loads and resources  avista utilities engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy  and  accordingly  is also subject to commodity price risk  credit risk and other risks associated with these activities 
as discussed above  avista utilities may also be exposed to refunds for wholesale power sales depending on the outcome of the ferc s retroactive price cap proceeding for the pacific northwest but would also have the opportunity to establish offsetting claims 
commodity price risk both avista utilities and avista energy are subject to energy commodity price risk 
historically  the price of power in wholesale markets was affected primarily by production costs and by other factors including streamflows  the availability of hydroelectric and thermal generation and transmission capacity  weather and the resulting retail loads  and the price of coal  natural gas and oil to thermal generating units 
any combination of these factors that resulted in a shortage of energy generally caused the market price of power to move upward 
now  however  market prices appear to be affected by other factors as well 
these factors include the gradual decline of excess generating capacity in the wscc and the effects of the restructuring of the electric utility business at the state and federal levels and the deregulation of wholesale energy markets 
as discussed above and in the section western power market issues the ferc imposed a price mitigation plan in the western united states in june price risk is  in general  the risk of fluctuation in the market price of the commodity needed  held or traded 
in the case of electricity  price movements may be correlated to adequacy of generating reserve margins  scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  the price of thermal generating plant fuel  and disruptions or constraints to transmission facilities 
demand changes caused by variations in the weather and other factors are also correlated to price movements 
price risk also includes the risk of fluctuation in the market price of associated derivative commodity instruments such as options and forward contracts 
price risk may also be influenced to the extent that the performance or non performance by market participants of their contractual obligations and commitments affect the supply of  or demand for  the commodity 
wholesale market prices for power and natural gas in the western united states and western canada were significantly higher in and the first half of than at any time in history  with unprecedented levels of volatility 
prices and volatility decreased considerably during the second half of credit risk 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that avista utilities and or avista energy would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to deliver energy and make financial settlements 
credit risk includes not only the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  but also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances that relate to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
avista utilities and avista energy seek to mitigate credit risk by applying specific eligibility criteria to existing and prospective counterparties and by actively monitoring current credit exposures 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by counterparties periodically occur 
avista energy experienced payment receipt defaults from certain parties impacted by the california energy crisis 
avista energy and avista corp 
through the avista utilities division have engaged in physical and financial transactions with enron and certain of its affiliates and experienced disruptions to forward contract commitments as a result of enron s december bankruptcy 
see enron exposure for more information 
credit risk also involves the exposure that counterparties perceive related to performance by avista utilities and avista energy to perform deliveries and settlement of energy resource transactions 
these counterparties seek assurance of performance in the form of letters of credit  prepayment or cash deposits  and  in the case of avista energy  parent company performance guaranties 
in periods of price volatility  the level of exposure can change significantly  with the result that sudden and significant demands may be made against the company s capital resource reserves credit facilities and cash 
avista utilities and avista energy actively monitor the exposure to possible collateral calls and take steps to minimize capital requirements 
other operating risks 
in addition to commodity price risk  avista utilities commodity positions are subject to operational and event risks including  among others  increases in load demand  transmission or transport disruptions  fuel quality specifications and forced outages at generating plants 
avista utilities also has exposure to weather conditions and natural disasters that can cause physical damage to property  requiring immediate repairs to restore utility service 
interest rate risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
the fair value of the company s cash and short term investment portfolio and the fair value of notes payable as of 
table of contents avista corporation december  approximated carrying value 
given the short term nature of these instruments  market risk  as measured by the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates  is immaterial 
the company manages interest rate risk by taking advantage of market conditions when timing the issuance of long term financings and optional debt redemptions and through the use of fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities 
a portion of the company s capitalization consisted of floating rate pollution control bonds  with the interest rate adjusted periodically prior to january in january  the interest rate on the bonds was fixed for a period of seven years 
the interest rate on million of company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred trust securities series b adjusts quarterly  reflecting current market conditions 
as of december   a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would result in an immaterial change in the company s cash flows related to the increased interest expense associated with these floating rate securities 
the company s credit ratings were downgraded during the fourth quarter of resulting in an overall corporate credit rating that is below investment grade 
these downgrades increased the cost of debt and other securities going forward and may affect the company s ability to issue debt and equity securities at reasonable interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
the company has investments in canadian companies through avista energy canada  ltd 
and copac management  inc the company s exposure to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk was immaterial to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position in and is not expected to change materially in the near future 
risk management risk policies and oversight 
avista utilities and avista energy use a variety of techniques to manage risks 
the company has risk management oversight for these risks for each area of the company s energy related business 
the company has a comprehensive risk management committee  separate from the units that create such risk exposure and overseen by the audit committee of the company s board of directors  to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies and procedures 
avista utilities and avista energy have policies and procedures to manage the risks  both quantitative and qualitative  inherent in their businesses 
the company s risk management committee reviews the status of risk exposures through regular reports and meetings and it monitors compliance with the company s risk management policies and procedures on a regular basis 
nonetheless  adverse changes in commodity prices  generating capacity  customer loads  and other factors may result in losses in earnings  cash flows and or fair values 
quantitative risk measurements 
avista utilities has volume limits for its imbalance between projected loads and resources 
normal operations result in seasonal mismatches between power loads and available resources 
avista utilities is able to vary the operation of its generating resources to help match hourly  daily and weekly load fluctuations 
avista utilities uses the wholesale power markets to sell projected resource surpluses and obtain resources when deficits are projected in the month forward planning horizon 
any imbalance is required to remain within limits  or management action or decisions are triggered to address larger imbalance situations 
volume limits for forward periods are based on monthly and quarterly averages that may vary materially from the actual load and resource variations within any given month or operating day 
future projections of resources are updated as forecasted streamflows and other factors differ from prior estimates 
forward power markets may be illiquid  and market products may only be available to approximate avista utilities desired transaction size and shape 
therefore  open imbalance positions exist at any given time 
avista energy measures the risk in its power and natural gas portfolio daily utilizing a value at risk var model  monitoring its risk in comparison to established thresholds 
var measures the worst expected loss over a given time interval under normal market conditions at a given confidence level 
avista energy also measures its open positions in terms of volumes at each delivery location for each forward time period 
the extent of open positions is included in the risk management policy and is measured with stress tests and var modeling 
the var computations are based on an historical simulation  that utilizes price movements over a specified period to simulate forward price curves in the energy markets to estimate the unfavorable impact of price movement in the portfolio of transactions scheduled to settle within the following eight calendar quarters 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across avista energy s continually changing portfolio 
var represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses in earnings that would be recognized on its portfolio assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 

table of contents avista corporation avista energy s var computations utilize several key assumptions  including a percent confidence level for the resultant price movement and holding periods of one and three days 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes and excludes the effects of written and embedded physical options in the trading portfolio 
as of december   avista energy s estimated potential one day unfavorable impact on gross margin was million  as measured by var  related to its commodity trading and marketing business  compared to million as of december  the average daily var for was million  compared to million in avista energy was outside of its one day var limits a total of two times during changes in markets inconsistent with historical trends or assumptions used could cause actual results to exceed predicted limits 
market risks associated with derivative commodity instruments held for purposes other than trading were not material as of december  for forward transactions that settle beyond the immediate eight calendar quarters  avista energy applies other risk measurement techniques  including price sensitivity stress tests  to assess the future market risk 
volatility in longer dated forward markets tends to be significantly less than near term markets 
economic and load growth avista utilities expects economic growth to continue in its eastern washington and northern idaho service area 
avista utilities  along with others in the service area  is continuing its efforts to facilitate expansion of existing businesses and attract new businesses to the inland northwest 
although agriculture  mining and lumber were the primary industries for many years  today health care  education  electronic and other manufacturing  tourism and the service sectors have become important industries that operate in avista utilities service area 
avista utilities also anticipates moderate economic growth to continue in its oregon service area 
avista utilities anticipates residential and commercial electric load growth to average between and percent annually for the next five years  primarily due to increases in both population and the number of businesses in its service territory 
the number of electric customers is expected to increase and the average annual usage by residential customers is expected to remain steady 
avista utilities anticipates natural gas load growth  including transportation volumes  in its washington and idaho service area to average between and percent annually for the next five years 
the oregon and south lake tahoe  california service areas are anticipated to average between and percent growth annually during that same period 
the anticipated natural gas load growth is primarily due to expected conversions from electric space and water heating to natural gas  and increases in both population and the number of businesses in its service territory 
the forward looking projections set forth above regarding retail sales growth are based  in part  upon purchased economic forecasts and publicly available population and demographic studies 
the expectations regarding retail sales growth are also based upon various assumptions including  without limitation  assumptions relating to weather and economic and competitive conditions  internal analysis of company specific data  such as energy consumption patterns and internal business plans  and an assumption that avista utilities will incur no material loss of retail customers due to self generation or retail wheeling 
changes in the underlying assumptions can cause actual experience to vary significantly from forward looking projections 
environmental issues since december  a number of species of fish in the northwest  including the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon  the kootenai river white sturgeon  the upper columbia river steelhead  the upper columbia river spring chinook salmon and the bull trout have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act 
thus far  measures that were adopted and implemented to save the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon have not directly impacted generation levels at any of avista utilities hydroelectric dams 
avista utilities does  however  purchase power from four projects on the columbia river that are directly impacted by ongoing mitigation measures for salmon and steelhead 
the reduction in generation at these projects is relatively minor  resulting in minimal economic impact on avista utilities at this time 
it is currently not possible to accurately predict the likely economic costs to the company resulting from all future actions 
the company received a new ferc operating license for the cabinet gorge and noxon rapids hydroelectric projects in march that incorporates a comprehensive settlement agreement 
the restoration of native salmonid fish  in particular bull trout  is a principal focus of the agreement 
a collaborative bull trout recovery program with the us

the company continues to study the issue of high dissolved gas levels downstream of cabinet gorge during spill periods  as agreed to in the settlement agreement for relicensing cabinet gorge 
to date  intensive biological studies in the lower clark fork river and lake pend oreille documented minimal biological effects of high dissolved gas levels on free ranging fish 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company will develop an abatement and or mitigation strategy in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information
