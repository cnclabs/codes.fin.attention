this investment  together with capital from a third party investment firm  was expected to put crescent machinery on solid financial footing 
following the date of the agreements relating to the acquisition of copi assets and stock and the investment in crescent machinery  the results of operations for the copi hotel operations and the copi land development interests declined  due in part to the slowdown in the economy after september in addition  crescent machinery s results of operations suffered because of the economic environment and the overall reduction in national construction levels that has affected the equipment rental and sale business  particularly post september as a result  the company believes that a significant additional investment would have been necessary to adequately capitalize crescent machinery and satisfy concerns of crescent machinery s lenders 
the company stopped recording rent from the leases of the eight resort hotel properties leased to subsidiaries of copi on october   and recorded impairment and other adjustments related to copi in the fourth quarter of  based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets

on february   the company terminated the agreement relating to its planned investment in crescent machinery 
on february   crescent machinery filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
on february   the company delivered default notices to copi relating to approximately million of unpaid rent and approximately million of principal and accrued interest due to the company under certain secured loans 
on february   the company executed an agreement the agreement with copi  pursuant to which copi transferred to subsidiaries of the company  in lieu of foreclosure  copi s lessee interests in the eight resort hotel properties leased to subsidiaries of copi and copi s voting interests in three of the company s residential development corporations and other assets and the company agreed to assist and provide funding to copi for the implementation of a prepackaged bankruptcy of copi 
in connection with the transfer  copi s rent obligations to the company were reduced by million  and its debt obligations were reduced by million 
these amounts include million of value attributed to the lessee interests transferred by copi to the company  however  in accordance with gaap  the company assigned no value to these interests for financial reporting purposes 
the company holds the lessee interests in the eight resort hotel properties and the voting interests in the three residential development corporations through three newly organized entities that are wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries of the company 
the company will include these assets in its resort hotel segment and its residential development segment  and will fully consolidate the operations of the eight resort hotel properties and the three residential development corporations  beginning on the date of the transfers of these assets 
under the agreement  the company will provide approximately million to copi in the form of cash and common shares of the company to fund costs  claims and expenses relating to the bankruptcy and related transactions  and to provide for the distribution of the company s common shares to the copi stockholders 
the company estimates that the value of the common shares that will be issued to the copi stockholders will be between approximately million and million 
the agreement provides that copi and the company will seek to have a plan of reorganization for copi  reflecting the terms of the agreement and a draft plan of reorganization  approved by the bankruptcy court 
the actual value of the common shares issued to the copi stockholders will not be determined until the confirmation of copi s bankruptcy plan and could vary substantially from the estimated amount 
in addition  the company has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist copi in arranging copi s repayment of its million obligation to bank of america  together with any accrued interest 
copi obtained the loan primarily to participate in investments with the company 
at the time copi obtained the loan  bank of america required  as a condition to making the loan  that richard e 
rainwater  the chairman of the board  and john c 
goff  the chief executive officer of the company  enter into a support agreement with copi and bank of america  pursuant to which they agreed to make additional equity investments in copi if copi defaulted on payment obligations under its line of credit with bank of america and the net proceeds of an offering of copi securities were insufficient to allow copi to pay bank of america in full 
copi currently is in default under the line of credit 
effective december   the parties executed an amendment to the line of credit providing that any defaults existing under the line of credit on or before march  are temporarily cured unless and until a new default shall occur 
the company believes  based on advice of counsel  that the support agreement should be unenforceable in a copi bankruptcy 
the company holds a first lien security interest in copi s entire membership interest in americold logistics 
reit rules prohibit the company from acquiring or owning the membership interest that copi owns in americold logistics 
under the agreement  the company agreed to allow copi to grant bank of america a first priority security interest in the membership interest and to subordinate its own security interest to bank of america 
in addition  the company has agreed to form and capitalize a separate entity to be owned by the company s shareholders  and to cause the new entity to commit to acquire copi s entire membership interest in the tenant  for approximately million 
under the agreement  copi has agreed that it will use the proceeds of the sale of the membership interest to repay bank of america in full

cash flow hedges the company uses derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage its fixed to variable rate debt ratio 
as of december   the company had entered into three cash flow hedge agreements which are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

the following table shows information regarding the company s cash flow hedge agreements as of december  and interest expense for the year ended december  dollars in millions additional interest expense issue notional maturity reference fair for the year date amount date rate market value ended december  the company has designated its three cash flow hedge agreements as cash flow hedges of libor based monthly interest payments on a designated pool of variable rate libor indexed debt that reprices closest to the reset dates of each cash flow hedge agreement 
for retrospective effectiveness testing  the company uses the cumulative dollar offset approach as described in derivatives implementation group dig issue e the dig is a task force designed to assist the fasb in answering questions that companies have resulting from implementation of sfas no 
and the company uses the change in variable cash flows method as described in dig issue g for prospective testing as well as for the actual recording of ineffectiveness  if any 
under this method  the company will compare the changes in the floating rate portion of each cash flow hedge to the floating rate of the hedged items 
the cash flow hedges have been and are expected to remain highly effective 
changes in the fair value of these highly effective hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the effective portion that has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings as interest expense when the hedged items impact earnings 
if a cash flow hedge falls outside effectiveness for a quarter  all changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge for the quarter will be recognized in earnings during the current period 
if it is determined based on prospective testing that it is no longer likely a hedge will be highly effective on a prospective basis  the hedge will no longer be designated as a cash flow hedge and no longer qualify for accounting in accordance with sfas nos 
and over the next twelve months  an estimated million to million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense and charged against earnings related to the effective portions of the cash flow hedge agreements 
interest rate caps in connection with the closing of the deutsche bank cmbs loan in may  the company entered into a libor interest rate cap struck at for a notional amount of million  and simultaneously sold a libor interest rate cap with the same terms 
since these instruments do not reduce the company s net interest rate risk exposure  they do not qualify as hedges and changes to their respective fair values are charged to earnings 
as the significant terms of these arrangements are substantially the same  the effects of a revaluation of these instruments are expected to substantially offset each other 
funds from operations ffo  based on the revised definition adopted by the board of governors of the nareit  effective january   and as used in this document  means o net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  o excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  o excluding extraordinary items as defined by gaap  o plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and o after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
the company considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit  and for its investment segments 
however  ffo o does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income  o is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs  and o should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s operating performance  or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of either liquidity or the company s ability to make distributions 
the company has historically distributed an amount less than ffo  primarily due to reserves required for capital expenditures  including leasing costs 
the aggregate cash distributions paid to shareholders and unitholders for the year ended december   and  were and million  respectively 
the company reported ffo of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the impairment and other charges related to copi of million  the company would have reported ffo of million for the year ended december  an increase or decrease in ffo does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because the company s board of trust managers is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for the company to maintain reit status 
however  the company must distribute of its reit taxable income as defined in the code 
therefore  a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders and unitholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 
accordingly  the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be considered in conjunction with the company s net income loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements 
however  the company s measure of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits because these reits may apply the definition of ffo in a different manner than the company

capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent and timing of improvements required to be made in the company s office property portfolio 
the company maintains an active preventive maintenance program in order to minimize required capital improvements 
in addition  certain capital improvement costs are recoverable from tenants 
tenant improvement and leasing costs also may fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the property  the term of the lease  the type of lease renewal or replacement tenant  the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions 
management believes that future recurring tenant improvements and leasing costs for the company s existing office properties will approximate on average for renewal tenants  to per square foot  or to per square foot per year based on an average five year lease term  and  on average for replacement tenants  to per square foot  or to per square foot per year based on an average five year lease term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s use of financial instruments  such as debt instruments  subject the company to market risk which may affect the company s future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of its assets 
market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the company manages its market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from its operating  investment and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments  distributions to shareholders  investments  capital expenditures and other cash requirements 
the company also enters into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
the following discussion of market risk is based solely on hypothetical changes in interest rates related to the company s variable rate debt 
this discussion does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect the financial instruments discussed in this section 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates on its short term variable rate debt 
the company had total outstanding debt of approximately billion at december   of which approximately billion  or approximately  was unhedged variable rate debt 
the weighted average interest rate on such variable rate debt was as of december  a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on such variable rate debt would result in an annual decrease in net income and cash flows of approximately million based on the unhedged variable rate debt outstanding as of december   as a result of the increased interest expense associated with the change in rate 
conversely  a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on such unhedged variable rate debt would result in an annual increase in net income and cash flows of approximately million based on the unhedged variable rate debt outstanding as of december   as a result of the decreased interest expense associated with the change in rate
