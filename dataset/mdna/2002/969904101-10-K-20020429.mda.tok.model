the following discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
risk factors the following information describes certain significant risks inherent in the company s business 
you should carefully consider such risks  together with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  perhaps significantly 
the company must successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends to succeed 
the company is a specialty retailer of products for the home  including cookware  cooking accessories  home furnishings and table accessories 
the company s success depends upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and customer demands in a timely manner 
shifts in consumer preferences away from the company s major product lines could have a negative impact on the company s business and operating results 
consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and may change between sales seasons 
if the company misjudges either the market for its merchandise or its customers purchasing habits  its sales may decline significantly and it may be required to markdown certain products to sell the resulting excess inventory  each of which would harm the company s business and operating results 
the company s ability to manage its inventory effectively and commensurate with customer demand depends on fluctuations in consumer preferences 
the company usually must order merchandise  and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise  well in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before trends are evidenced by customer purchases 
the extended lead times for many of the company s purchases may make it difficult for the company to respond rapidly to new or changing trends 
in addition  the seasonal nature of the specialty home products business requires the company to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to peak selling season 
as a result  the company is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
if the company does not accurately predict its customers preferences and acceptance levels of its products  its business and operating results may be negatively impacted 
the company s success also depends on maintaining favorable brand recognition 
if any of the company s vendors  manufacturers or stores does not adhere to the company s quality control or service procedures or otherwise fail to ensure the satisfactory quality of its products  the company could lose customer goodwill  which could negatively affect the company s business and operating results 
the company s growth in sales and profits depends on its ability to successfully open new stores 
in each of the past three fiscal years  the company s retail stores have generated nearly of its net revenues 
the company plans a net increase of approximately new retail stores in fiscal as part of its growth strategy 
there is no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
the company s ability to open additional stores will depend upon a number of factors  including the identification and availability of suitable locations  the company s success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms  the company s ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals  the hiring and training of skilled operating personnel  especially management  the timely development of new stores  including the availability of construction materials and labor  the availability of financing on acceptable terms if at all  and general economic conditions 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
time frames for lease negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays 
construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to open new stores or that  if opened  those stores will be operated profitably 
the company faces intense competition 
the specialty retail business is highly competitive 
the company faces a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing its products to consumers in several diverse market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value  and providing strong and effective marketing support 
the company s specialty retail stores  mail order catalogs and internet websites compete with other retail stores  other mail order catalogs and other e commerce websites that market lines of merchandise similar to those of the company 
the company competes with national  regional and local businesses utilizing a similar retail store strategy  as well as traditional furniture stores  department stores and specialty stores 
the substantial sales growth in the direct to customer industry within the last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
the company s business is dependent on factors affecting consumer spending 
the company s business is dependent on consumer demand for its products and  consequently  is sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer spending  including general economic conditions  disposable consumer income  fears of recession  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending could reduce customer demand for the company s products  thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming its operating results 
the company depends on key domestic and foreign vendors for timely and effective sourcing of its merchandise 
the company s performance depends on its ability to purchase its merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices 
the company purchases its merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers 
the company has no contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products and any vendor or distributor could discontinue selling to the company at any time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to the company in the future 
any inability to acquire suitable merchandise or the loss of one or more key vendors could have a negative effect on the company s business and operating results unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured 
the company may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources  if any  may be of a lesser quality and or more expensive than those the company currently purchases 
the company s sourcing strategy includes relationships with manufacturers in over countries 
approximately of the company s payments for merchandise in fiscal were to foreign vendors  most of which are located in europe and asia 
substantially all of the company s foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars 
the company s sourcing operations and arrangements with foreign vendors are subject to a variety of risks  including import duties and quotas  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  work stoppages  economic uncertainties including inflation  foreign government regulations  political unrest and trade restrictions 
in addition  the company competes with other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity 
the company cannot predict whether any of the countries in which its products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
any event causing a sudden disruption or delay of imports from foreign vendors  including the imposition of additional import restrictions  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or increased tariffs or quotas  or both  against home centered items could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to the company and adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company must timely and effectively deliver merchandise to its stores and customers 
the company relies upon third party carriers for its product shipments  including shipments to its customers and to and from all of its stores  and accordingly is subject to the risks  including employee strikes and inclement weather  associated with such carriers ability to provide delivery services to meet the company s shipping needs 
failure to deliver products to customers in a timely manner could damage the company s reputation and brands 
the company experiences fluctuations in its comparable store sales 
the company s success depends  in part  upon its ability to improve sales at its stores 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including the general retail sales environment  changes in sales mix between distribution channels  the company s ability to efficiently source and distribute products  changes in the company s merchandise mix  competition  current economic conditions  the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events  the success of marketing programs and weather conditions 
these factors may cause the company s comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations 
the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis  and the company expects that it will continue to fluctuate in the future 
the company s comparable store net sales increases for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
past comparable store sales are no indication of future results  and there can be no assurance that the company s comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 
the company s ability to maintain and improve its comparable store sales results depends in large part on maintaining and improving its forecasting of customer demand and buying trends  selecting effective marketing techniques  providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for its broad and diverse customer base and using more effective pricing strategies 
any failure to meet the comparable store sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of the company s common stock 
the failure to successfully manage the company s catalog mailings and fulfillment may have a negative impact on the company s business 
postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of the company s catalog mailings 
the company relies on discounts from the basic postal rate structure  such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes 
the company s cost of paper has fluctuated significantly during the past three fiscal years  and its future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces external to its business 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to an increase in paper costs 
although the company has entered into long term contracts for the paper and printing of its catalogs  these contracts offer no assurance that the company s catalog production costs will not substantially increase following expiration of the contracts 
future increases in postal rates or paper or printing costs would have a negative impact on the company s operating results to the extent that the company is unable to pass such increases on directly to customers or offset such increases by raising selling prices or by implementing more efficient printing  mailing  delivery and order fulfillment systems 
each catalog issue requires substantial investments in layout and design  paper  printing  and inventory prior to mailing 
as a result  the company is not able to adjust these costs for a particular mailing in response to the actual performance of the catalog 
the company has historically experienced fluctuations in customer response to its catalogs 
customer response to the company s catalogs is substantially dependent on merchandise assortment  availability and creative presentation as well as the timing of delivery of the catalogs 
the lack of effective performance of any third parties with respect to production and distribution of catalogs could affect the timing of delivery of catalogs 
any delay could cause customers to forego or defer purchases from the company 
if the company is unable to achieve favorable customer response in the future  its revenues could decline 
the operation of the company s direct to customer business is also dependent on the company s ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its order taking and fulfillment operations and its e commerce websites 
disruptions or slowdowns in these areas could result from disruptions in telephone service or power outages  inadequate system capacity  human error  natural disasters or adverse weather conditions 
these problems could result in a reduction in net revenues as well as increased administrative costs 
the company s inability or failure to protect its intellectual property would have a negative impact on the company s business 
the company s trademarks  service marks  copyrights  patents  trade dress rights  trade secrets  domain names and similar intellectual property are critical to its success 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of the company s trademarks or other intellectual property could diminish the value of the company s proprietary rights or goodwill 
there can be no assurance that effective trademark  service mark  copyright  trade secret and other protection is or will be available 
the company is planning certain system changes that may disrupt its supply chain 
the company s success depends on its ability to continue sourcing merchandise efficiently 
the company continues to evaluate possible modifications to its information technology systems supporting the product pipeline  including design  sourcing  merchandise planning  forecasting and purchase order  inventory  distribution  transportation and price management 
modifications may involve updating or replacing legacy systems with successor systems  if necessary 
the company is aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these core systems  including supply chain disruptions  and believes that it is taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks by staffing with qualified technology and business professionals  insuring end to end business ownership and staging implementation 
the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over several years 
there can be no assurances that the company will successfully launch these new systems or that they will occur without supply chain disruptions 
any resulting supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
the company estimates a provision for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory based on specific identification and inventory aging reports 
catalog amortization prepaid catalog expenses consist of the third party incremental direct costs including primarily creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all company direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability at each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future net revenues net sales less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog completion costs associated with that catalog 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated probable remaining future net revenue  the excess is expensed in the reporting period 
sales return reserve the company records a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
if actual returns are greater than those projected by management  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
self insured liabilities the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability insurance 
the company records its self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
results of operations net revenues net revenues consist of retail sales  direct to customer sales and shipping fees
