item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources  and interest rate sensitivity 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
changes in interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth  for the period indicated  the increase or decrease of certain items in the consolidated statements of operations of the company as compared to the prior periods year ended december  versus versus versus amount of percent of amount of percent of amount of percent of increase increase increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease interest income loans  including fees    federal funds sold    time deposits in other financial institutions    investment securities    total interest income    interest expense deposits    bonds payable and other borrowings    total interest expense    net interest income    provision for loan losses    net interest income after provision for loan losses    other income gains from loan sales    loan servicing fees    income from sale of interest in subsidiary   other loan origination fees sold or brokered loans    document processing fees    service charges    gain from sale of servicing assets   other income    proceeds from legal settlement  total other income    year ended december  versus versus versus amount of percent of amount of percent of amount of percent of increase increase increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease other expenses salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expenses    depreciation expense    other operating expenses    loan servicing and collection expense    impairment of goodwill   professional services    advertising expense    amortization of intangible assets    office supply expense    data processing atm processing    postage and freight    lower of cost or market provision   professional expenses associated with legal settlement  total other expenses    loss income before benefit provision for income taxes    benefit provision for income taxes    net income loss    net interest income and net interest margin the company earns income from two sources 
the primary source is from the management of its financial assets and liabilities 
the second is from charging fees for services it provides 
the company s income from managing assets consists of gains realized on the sale of loans originated and the difference between the interest income received from its loan portfolio and investments and the interest expense paid on its liabilities  primarily interest paid on deposits 
this difference or spread is net interest income 
the net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets  is referred to as the net interest margin on interest earning assets 
the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the level and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
the company s net yield on interest earning assets is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on the company s loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  competitive factors  and general economic conditions such as federal economic policies  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters 
the following table presents the net interest income and net interest margin year ended december  interest income    interest expense    net interest income    net interest margin total interest income decreased from  in to  in total interest expense decreased from  in to  in the decrease in both interest income and interest expense was primarily due to a a decline in interest rates  b the sale of palomar which is included in the income statement for for seven and one half months only  and c prepayments experienced in the company s securitized loan portfolio off set by increases in the level and yield of goleta s short term consumer loans 
as a result  net interest income decreased from  in to  in the following table sets forth the changes in interest income and expense attributable to changes in rates and volumes year ended december  dollars in thousands versus versus versus change change change change change change total due to due to total due to due to total due to due to change rate volume change rate volume change rate volume time deposits in other financial institutions federal funds sold investment securities loans  net         short term consumer loans      securitized loans         total interest earning assets          interest bearing demand savings time certificates of deposit         federal funds purchased bonds payable       other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities       net interest income          provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses corresponds directly to the level of the allowance that management deems sufficient to provide for probable losses  inherent in the loan portfolio 
the accumulated balance in the allowance for loan loss reflects the estimated amount which management determined is adequate to provide for any probable inherent loan losses after considering the mix of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  past loan experience and any other relevant factors 
management reviews the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis and records additional provisions to the allowance as needed 
management allocated  as a provision for loan losses in   in and  in beginning in the year  management began tracking loan loss provision by major business segment 
the following table summarizes the provision expense for the year ended december  provision percent of loans ending loan expense in each category balance short term consumer loan portfolio   securitized loan portfolio   general loan portfolio principally sba   total provision   loans charged off  net of recoveries were  in   in  and  in the increased charge offs in were primarily due to the short term consumer  securitized loan  and sba programs 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total gross loans was at december l   at december   and at december  in management s opinion  the balance of the allowance for loan losses at december  was sufficient to absorb known and inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio at that time 
other income changes in the components of other income are summarized in the section entitled results of operations 
the following table summarizes the company s other income for the three years indicated year ended december  other income gains from sale of loans    loan origination fees    document processing fees    service charges    loan servicing income    gain from sale of subsidiary   proceeds from legal settlement  gain from sale of servicing asset  other income    total other income    other income increased by  from to and by another  from to the primary factors contributing to the  increase in were a a  gain on the sale of the company s epacific 
com subsidiary  b a  increase in gain on sale of loans  principally sba loans  and c a  increase in loan servicing income 
part of the  increase in loan servicing fees was due to a  write down of the company s consumer finance servicing asset in there was no such write down in most of the remaining increase in loan servicing income was due to increased volume in the company s sba loan business 
the increases in other income were partially offset by an  decrease in loan origination fees  principally in the company s mortgage origination business 
the primary factors contributing to the  increase in other income in were a  in proceeds from a legal settlement against the company s former auditors  b an  increase in document processing fees  principally in the company s mortgage origination business  and c a  increase in loan origination fees  also principally in the company s mortgage origination business 
several factors adversely affected other income including a an  reduction in the gain on sale of loans  principally in the company s sba business  and b a  reduction in loan servicing fees 
the  reduction in loan servicing fees was principally due to an increase in the amortization and write down of the company s sba related servicing and interest only strip assets 
these assets were written down by  in and  in other expenses changes in the components of other expense are summarized in the section entitled result of operations 
the following table summarizes the company s other expense for the three years indicated year ended december  other expense salaries and employee benefits    occupancy and depreciation expense    other operating expense    loan servicing and collection expense    professional services    advertising    data and atm processing expense    amortization of goodwill    impairment charge for goodwill  lower of cost or market expense  postage and freight    office supplies    legal settlement expense  total other expense    other expenses decreased by  from to and increased by  from to the primary factors contributing to the  decrease in were a a  reduction in salaries and employee benefits  principally due to the downsizing of the company s consumer finance and mortgage origination activities  b a  reduction in advertising expense  c a  lower of cost or market adjustment to the company s consumer finance loan balances recorded in  but not in the year  and d a  reduction in professional service expense in  principally due to the elimination of the costs associated with securitization activities  and in due to the restatement of financial statements 
loans which are originated and sold in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value determined on an aggregate basis 
at december   the company recorded a valuation adjustment to these loans of  at december  and  management determined that carrying value approximated fair value and  thus  no valuation adjustment was determined to be necessary 
the primary factors contributing to the  increase in other expenses from to were a  of professional expenses incurred in in connection with a legal settlement with the company s former auditors  and b a  increase in salaries and employee benefits  principally commission paid on sba and mortgage loans originated or brokered 
these increases were offset  in part  by a the elimination in of the impairment of goodwill charge from the sale of the company s subsidiary  palomar  and b a reduction of  in loan servicing and collection expense  principally due to the paydown of goleta s securitized loan portfolios which are serviced by a third party servicer 
the following table compares the various elements of other expenses as a percentage of average assets total salaries and occupancy and other year ended december  average other employee depreciation operating dollars in thousands assets expense benefits expenses expenses based on the average of daily balances 
income taxes income taxes benefit provision was  in   in  and  in the effective income benefit tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the change in effective tax rates from to is principally due to the sale of palomar and the proceeds from capital recovery 
net income loss net income loss for the company was  in   in  and  in earnings loss per share was per share both undiluted and diluted in  per share per share on a diluted basis in  and per share both undiluted and diluted in the reduction in net income in was the result of a number of factors including  among other things a the impact of adverse economic conditions which caused the company to record an million provision for loan losses  b an increase in prepayment speed assumptions of sold loans which caused the company to record million in amortizations and or write downs of its servicing and interest only assets  c a reduction in net interest income resulting from both a lower interest rate environment and lower securitized loan and related bond borrowing balances  and d million of expense associated with litigation with the company s former auditors 
these adverse factors were partially offset by the  proceeds from a legal settlement with the company s former auditors 
the loss in was the result of a number of factors including  but not limited to a million of losses suffered by the company s epacific 
com subsidiary  and b an approximately million write down in the carrying value of approximately million of loans previously accumulated for a canceled securitization transaction 
capital resources the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  herein referred to as the fdicia  was signed into law on december  fdicia included significant changes to the legal and regulatory environment for insured depository institutions  including reductions in insurance coverage for certain kinds of deposits  increased supervision by the federal regulatory agencies  increased reporting requirements for insured institutions  and new regulations concerning internal controls  accounting  and operations 
the prompt corrective action regulations of fdicia define specific capital categories based on the institutions capital ratios 
the capital categories  in declining order  are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a core capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
additionally  fdicia imposed in a new tier i risk based capital ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
tier i risk based capital is  primarily  common stock and retained earnings net of goodwill and other intangible assets 
to be categorized as adequately capitalized or well capitalized  goleta must maintain minimum total risk based  tier i risk based  and tier i leverage ratios and values as set forth in the tables below to be well capitalized for capital adequacy under prompt corrective actual purposes action provisions year ended december  amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total risk based capital to risk weighted assets consolidated   n a n a goleta national bank    tier i capital to risk weighted assets consolidated   n a n a goleta national bank    tier i capital to average assets consolidated   n a n a goleta national bank    not applicable

a bank may not be considered well capitalized if it is operating under a regulatory agreement  as is the case of goleta 
see supervision and regulation formal agreement with the occ 
in the fourth quarter of  the occ notified goleta that it had incorrectly calculated the amount of regulatory capital required to be held in respect to residual interests retained by goleta in two securitizations of loans that were consummated in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of accordingly  the occ informed goleta that it was significantly undercapitalized at march   june  and september  on november   certain directors of the company made a new debt and equity investment in the company of approximately million 
simultaneously  the company made a capital contribution to goleta of approximately million 
the occ subsequently informed goleta that it was again adequately capitalized 
on march   goleta signed a written agreement the formal agreement with the occ 
under the terms of the formal agreement  by september   goleta was required to achieve and maintain total capital at least equal to of risk weighted assets  and tier i capital at least equal to of adjusted total assets 
the formal agreement also required submission of a capital plan  which included  among other things  specific plans for meeting the special capital requirements  projections for growth and a dividend policy 
the formal agreement placed limitations on growth and payments of dividends until goleta was in compliance with its approved capital plan 
see supervision and regulation formal agreement with the occ 
goleta achieved and maintained both of the aforementioned required and capital ratios from september  to the end of as the result of fourth quarter losses  goleta s risk based capital ratio declined to at december  on march   the company made a  capital contribution to goleta  which would have increased goleta s risk based capital ratio to at december   had the contribution been made on that date

interest only strips at december  and  the company held interest only strips in the amount of  and  respectively 
these interest only strips represent the present value of the right to the estimated net cash flows generated by the sba loans sold 
net cash flows consist of the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the company determines the present value of these estimated net cash flows at the time each loan sale closes  utilizing discount rate and prepayment rate assumptions for each transaction 
the value of these assets is recalculated each period by taking into account the value of a new loans added to the portfolio of serviced loans  b loans paid or charged off  c the expected normal amortization payment schedule of the serviced loan portfolio  d a constant prepayment speed cpr assumption  and e appropriate discount rates 
at december   the company utilized a cpr assumption of which is the weighted average actual prepayment speed experienced by all serviced loans which have been in the portfolio for more than eight quarters 
this prepayment speed assumption is applied to all loans including those which have been in the portfolio for less than eight quarters 
the company uses discount rates of to in its calculations 
at december   the company utilized an cpr assumption and discount rates of to 
the interest only strips are accounted for as investments in debt securities classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company marks them to fair value with the resulting increase or decrease recorded through operations in the current period 
loan portfolio the company s largest categories of loans held in the portfolio are commercial loans  real estate loans  unguaranteed portion of sba insured loans  installment loans  and second mortgage loans 
loans are carried at face amount  net of payments collected  the allowance for possible loan losses  deferred loan fees and discounts on loans purchased 
interest on all loans is accrued daily  primarily on a simple interest basis 
it is generally the company s policy to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan is days past due 
thereafter  previously recorded interest is reversed and interest income typically recognized on a cash basis 
certain loans days or more past due are maintained on accrual status as long as the management of the company remains confident the loan will be repaid in full within a short period of time 
the rates charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments 
these increments vary in relation to the company s published prime lending rate or other appropriate indices 
at december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable interest rate loans 
at december  and  variable rate loans comprised approximately and  respectively  of the company s loan portfolio 
management monitors the maturity of loans and the sensitivity of loans to changes in interest rates 
the following table sets forth  as of the dates indicated  the amount of gross loans outstanding based on the remaining scheduled repayments of principal  which either could be repriced or remain fixed until maturity  classified by years until maturity 
december  dollars in thousands fixed variable fixed variable fixed variable less than one year      one year to five years       more than five years     total       approximately million of these loans are in the company s securitized loan portfolio which is funded by approximately million of bonds payable 
distribution of loans the distribution of the company s total loans by type of loan  as of the dates indicated  is shown in the following table year ended december  dollars in thousands percentage percentage percentage loan to gross loan to gross loan to gross type of loan balance loans balance loans balance loans commercial    real estate    unguaranteed portion of loans insured by sba    installment    loan participations purchased  loans held for sale    securitized loans    gross loans    less allowance for loan losses    deferred loan fees costs   discount on sba loans    net loans    commercial loans in addition to traditional term commercial loans made to business customers  the company grants revolving business lines of credit 
under the terms of the revolving line of credit  the company grants a maximum loan amount  which remains available to the business during the loan term 
as part of the loan requirements  the business agrees to maintain its primary banking relationship with the company 
it is the company s policy not to extend material loans of this type in excess of one year 
real estate loans real estate loans are primarily made for the purpose of purchasing  improving  or constructing  single family residences  commercial  or industrial properties 
the majority of the company s real estate loans are collateralized by liens on single family homes 
maturities on such loans are generally to years 
a large part of the company s real estate construction loans are first and second trust deeds on the construction of owner occupied single family dwellings 
the company also makes real estate construction loans on commercial properties 
these consist of first and second trust deeds collateralized by the related real property 
construction loans are generally written with terms of six to twelve months and usually do not exceed a loan to appraised value of 
commercial and industrial real estate loans are secured by nonresidential property 
office buildings or other commercial property primarily secure these loans 
loan to appraised value ratios on nonresidential real estate loans are generally restricted to of appraised value of the underlying real property 
unguaranteed portion of sba loans the company is approved as a preferred lender by the sba 
loans made by the company under programs offered by the sba are generally made to small businesses for the construction or purchase of facilities  purchase of equipment  working capital or the initial business purchase 
the sba generally guarantees between and of the funded commitment 
borrowers are required to provide adequate collateral for these loans  similar to other commercial loans 
the sba allows less collateralized loans under its low doc program for loan commitments under  when the company originates an sba loan  the guaranteed portion of the loan is typically sold into the secondary market 
the company typically retains the unguaranteed portion of the loan  as well as the servicing right and related fee income on the loan 
the sba loans are all variable interest rate loans based upon the wall street journal prime rate 
the servicing spread is a minimum of on all loans 
income recognized by the company on the sales of the guaranteed portion of these loans and the ongoing servicing income received  are significant revenue sources for the company 
installment loans installment loans consist of automobile  small equity lines of credit  loans secured by manufactured housing and general purpose loans made to individuals 
these loans are primarily fixed rate loans with terms up to five years 
included in this category as of december  and are approximately million and million  respectively of the company s short term consumer lending product  which consists of day loans to individuals 
see item business lines of business short term consumer lending 
second mortgage loans the company originates second mortgage loans with loan to value ratios as high as 
in and  the company transferred million and million of these loans  respectively  to special purpose trusts the trusts 
the trusts then sold bonds to third party investors  which were secured by the transferred loans 
the bonds are held in a trust independent of the company  the trustee of which oversees the distribution to the bondholders 
the mortgage loans are serviced by a third party the servicer  who receives a stated servicing fee 
there is an insurance policy on the subordinate bonds that guarantees the payment of the bonds 
as part of the securitization agreements  the company received an option to repurchase the bonds when the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans sold declined to or less of the original balance of mortgage loans securitized 
because the company has a call option to reacquire the loans transferred and did not retain the servicing rights  the company has not surrendered effective control over the loans transferred 
therefore  the securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings with a pledge of collateral 
accordingly  the company consolidates the trusts and the financial statements of the company include the loans transferred and the related bonds issued 
the securitized loans are classified as held for investment 
the company continues to originate second mortgage loans  but now sells them to third parties approximately twice a month 
loan commitments outstanding the company s loan commitments outstanding at the dates indicated are summarized below december  dollars in thousands commercial    real estate    loans guaranteed by the sba    installment loans    standby letters of credit total commitments    summary of loan losses experience as is customary in the lending business  the company experienced loan losses during the year 
the risk of loss varies depending on the type of loan granted and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
the degree of perceived risk is addressed during the structure of the loan 
the company attempts to minimize its credit risk exposure through the use of thorough approval and underwriting procedures and a comprehensive loan application process 
the company maintains a program of systematic review of its existing loans 
loans are graded for their overall quality 
the company s management determines which loans require further monitoring and supervision 
these loans are segregated for periodic review 
the company s loan committee reviews any loans designated as significant problem loans on a monthly basis 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include  payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis 
when determining the possibility of impairment  management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the securitized and short term consumer loans  which are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis 
the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired december  december  impaired loans without specific valuation allowances   impaired loans with specific valuation allowances    specific valuation allowances allocated to impaired loans    impaired loans  net    average investment in impaired loans    interest income recognized on impaired loans    the accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan  generally at the time the loan is days delinquent  unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time 
thereafter  interest income is no longer recognized on the loan 
as such  interest income may be recognized on impaired loans to the extent they are not past due by days or more 
interest on non accrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
all of the impaired loans disclosed above are on nonaccrual status 
financial difficulties encountered by certain borrowers may cause the company to restructure the terms of their loan to facilitate loan repayment 
a troubled loan that is restructured would generally be considered impaired 
the balance of impaired loans disclosed above includes all troubled debt restructured loans that  as of december    and are considered impaired 
the following schedule reflects recorded investment at the dates indicated  in certain types of loans december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans    troubled debt restructured loans  gross  interest foregone on nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructuring outstanding   loans through days past due with interest accruing    goleta charges off a any loan classified as a loss  b portions of loans which are deemed to be uncollectible  c short term consumer loans which are past due or more days  d overdrafts which have been outstanding for more than days  e consumer finance loans which are past due or more days  and f all other unsecured loans past due or more days 
charge offs are applied as a reduction to goleta s allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are applied as increases to goleta s allowance for loan losses

a provision for loan losses is charged to expense 
the allowance is charged for losses when management believes that full recovery on the loan is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio  which take into consideration such factors as changes in the growth  size and composition of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  collateral  guarantees and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and and or the value of the underlying collateral 
these estimates depend on the outcome of future events and  therefore  contain inherent uncertainties 
management of the company reviews with the board of directors the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
the loan loss provision is adjusted when specific items reflect a need for an adjustment 
management believes the level of the allowance for loan losses as of december   is adequate to absorb known and inherent losses  however  changes in the local economy  the ability of borrowers to repay amounts borrowed and other factors may result in the need to increase the allowance through charges to earnings 
interest rates and differentials the following table illustrates average yields on our interest earning assets and average rates on our interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated 
these average yields and rates are derived by dividing interest income by the average balances of interest earning assets and by dividing interest expense by the average balances of interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated

liquidity management the company has an asset and liability management program which attempts to a maintain interest margins during times of both rising and falling interest rates  and b maintain sufficient liquidity 
liquidity management is monitored by the principal financial officer daily and by the asset liability committee of the company s board of directors quarterly

the liquidity ratio consist of cash and due from banks  deposits in other financial institutions  available for sale investments  federal funds sold and loans held for sale  divided by total assets 
when the company has more funds than it needs for its reserve requirements or short term liquidity needs  the company increases its securities investments or sells federal funds 
management believes it maintains adequate liquidity levels

however  management does not believe that deposit levels are significantly influenced by seasonal factors 
supervision and regulation introduction banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system  to protect depositors and the fdic insurance fund  and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress and the states have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies  and the banking industry 
consequently  the company s growth and earnings performance  as well as that of goleta  may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions  but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statutes and regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities  including the board of governors of the federal reserve bank frb  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  and the california department of financial institutions dfi 
goleta is currently operating under a written agreement with the occ the formal agreement 
see formal agreement with the occ at the end of this section 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to the company and its banking subsidiary  goleta  governs most aspects of their business  including the scope of permissible business activities  investments  reserves that must be maintained against deposits  capital levels that must be maintained  the nature and amount of collateral that may be taken to secure loans  the establishment of new branches  mergers and consolidations with other financial institutions  and the payment of dividends 
from time to time legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business and changing the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions 
various federal laws enacted over the past several years have provided  among other things  for the maintenance of mandatory reserves with the frb on deposits by depository institutions  the phasing out of the restrictions on the amount of interest which financial institutions may pay on certain types of accounts  and the authorization of various types of new deposit accounts  such as now accounts  money market deposit accounts and super now accounts  designed to be competitive with money market mutual funds and other types of accounts and services offered by various financial and non financial institutions 
the lending authority and permissible activities of certain non bank financial institutions  such as savings and loan associations and credit unions  have been expanded  and federal regulators have been given increased enforcement authority 
these laws have generally had the effect of altering competitive relationships existing among financial institutions  reducing the historical distinctions between the services offered by banks  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions  and increasing the cost of funds to banks and other depository institutions 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations affecting banks is only a summary  does not purport to be complete  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
no assurance can be given that the statutes and regulations will not change in the future 
moreover  any changes may have a material adverse effect on our business 
supervision and regulation of the company general the company  as a bank holding company registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended herein referred to the bhca  is subject to regulation by the frb 
under frb regulation  the company is expected to act as a source of managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiary 
it cannot conduct operations in an unsafe or unsound manner and must commit resources to support its banking subsidiary in circumstances where the company might not otherwise do so 
under the bhca  the company and its banking subsidiary are subject to periodic examination by the frb 
the company is also required to file periodic reports of its operations and any additional information regarding its activities and those of its subsidiaries with the frb  as may be required 
the company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
as such  the company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the commissioner of the dfi  herein referred to as the commissioner 
regulations have not yet been proposed or adopted or steps otherwise taken to implement the commissioner s powers under this statute 
bank holding company liquidity the company is a legal entity  separate and distinct from its bank subsidiary 
although it has the ability to raise capital on its own behalf or borrow from external sources  the company may also obtain additional funds through dividends paid by  and fees for services provided to  the bank subsidiary 
however  regulatory constraints may restrict or totally preclude its bank subsidiary from paying dividends to the company 
see limitations on dividend payments 
the frb s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways  such as by borrowing  that weaken the bank holding company s financial health or its ability to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks 
the frb also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
in march  the company entered into a memorandum of understanding with the frb  which requires the company to refrain from declaring any dividends on the company s stock or redeeming any of its stock without the approval of the frb 
see memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank 
transactions with affiliates the company and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of the bank subsidiary within the meaning of sections a and b of the federal reserve act  herein referred to as the fra  as amended 
pursuant thereto  loans by goleta to affiliates  investments by goleta in affiliates stock  and taking affiliates stock as collateral for loans to any borrower will be limited to of goleta s capital  in the case of any one affiliate  and will be limited to of goleta s capital in the case of all affiliates 
in addition  such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
specifically  a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low quality asset  as defined in the fra 
such restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts 
the company and goleta are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary recent legislation 
limitations on businesses and investment activities under the bhca  a bank holding company must obtain the frb s approval before directly or indirectly acquiring more than ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank  or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
the frb may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the united states without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located 
in approving interstate acquisitions  however  the frb must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is located  provided that those limits do not discriminate against out of state depository institutions or their holding companies  and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time  not to exceed five years  before being acquired by an out of state bank holding company 
in general  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting securities of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company 
however  with frb consent  a bank holding company may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
the company  therefore  is permitted to engage in a variety of banking related businesses 
some of the activities that the frb has determined  pursuant to its regulation y  to be related to banking are making or acquiring loans or other extensions of credit for its own account or for the account of others  servicing loans and other extensions of credit  operating a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law under certain circumstances  leasing personal and real property or acting as agent  broker  or adviser in leasing such property in accordance with various restrictions imposed by frb regulations  providing financial  banking  or economic data processing and data transmission services  owning  controlling  or operating a savings association under certain circumstances  selling money orders  travelers checks and us savings bonds  providing securities brokerage services  related securities credit activities pursuant to regulation t  and other incidental activities  and underwriting and dealing in obligations of the united states  general obligations of states and their political subdivisions  and other obligations authorized for state member banks under federal law 
generally  the bhca does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
thus  for example  goleta may not extend credit  lease or sell property  or furnish any services  or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or services from or to goleta other than a loan  discount  deposit or trust service  the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or service from or to the company or goleta  or the customer may not obtain some other credit  property or services from competitors  except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended in late  the gramm leach bliley act  herein referred to as the glb act  was enacted 
the glb act significantly changed the regulatory structure and oversight of the financial services industry 
the glb act permits banks and bank holding companies to engage in previously prohibited activities under certain conditions 
also  banks and bank holding companies may affiliate with other financial service providers such as insurance companies and securities firms under certain conditions 
consequently  a qualifying bank holding company  called a financial holding company  herein referred to as fhc  can engage in a full range of financial activities  including banking  insurance  and securities activities  as well as merchant banking and additional activities that are beyond those traditionally permitted for bank holding companies 
moreover  various non bank financial service providers who were previously prohibited from engaging in banking can now acquire banks while also offering services such as securities underwriting and underwriting and brokering insurance products 
the glb act also expands passive investment activities by fhcs  permitting them to indirectly invest in any type of company  financial or non financial  through merchant banking activities and insurance company affiliations 
see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary recent legislation 
capital adequacy bank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a bank holding company  among other things  may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses 
the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and state member banks  discussed in more detail below see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary risk based capital guidelines  assign various risk percentages to different categories of assets  and capital is measured as a percentage of those risk assets 
under the terms of the guidelines  bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk assets and on total assets  without regard to risk weights 
the risk based guidelines are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations 
for example  the frb s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk  the risks posed by concentrations of credit  or risks associated with nontraditional banking activities or securities trading activities 
moreover  any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities  particularly under the expanded powers of the glb act  may be expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
limitations on dividend payments the company is entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by goleta s board of directors  out of funds legally available for dividends  as specified and limited by the occ s regulations 
pursuant to the occ s regulations  funds available for a national bank s dividends are restricted to the lesser of the bank s i retained earnings  or ii net income for the current and past two fiscal years less any dividends paid during that period  unless approved by the occ 
furthermore  if the occ determines that a dividend would cause a bank s capital to be impaired or that payment would cause it to be undercapitalized  the occ can prohibit payment of a dividend notwithstanding that funds are legally available 
since goleta is an fdic insured institution  it is also possible  depending upon its financial condition and other factors  that the fdic could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  constitute an unsafe or unsound practice and  thus  prohibit those payments 
as a california corporation  the company s ability to pay dividends is subject to the dividend limitations of the california corporations code  herein referred to as the ccc 
section of the ccc allows the company to pay a dividend to its shareholders only to the extent that the company has retained earnings and  after the dividend  the company meets the following criteria its assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets would be times its liabilities exclusive of deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred credits  and its current assets would be at least equal to its current liabilities 
supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary general goleta  as a national banking association member  which is also a member of the federal reserve system  is subject to regulation  supervision  and regular examination by the occ  the fdic and the frb 
goleta s deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum extent provided by law 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the goleta s business 
california law exempts all banks from usury limitations on interest rates 
recent legislation on november   the glb act was signed into law  significantly changing the regulatory structure and oversight of the financial services industry 
effective march   the glb act repealed the provisions of the glass steagall act that restricted banks and securities firms from affiliating 
it also revised the bhca to permit an fhc to engage in a full range of financial activities  including banking  insurance  securities  and merchant banking activities 
it also permits fhcs to acquire many types of financial firms without the frb s prior approval 
the glb act thus provides expanded financial affiliation opportunities for existing bank holding companies and permits other financial service providers to acquire banks and become bank holding companies without ceasing any existing financial activities 
previously  a bank holding company could only engage in activities that were closely related to banking 
this limitation no longer applies to bank holding companies that qualify to be treated as fhcs 
to qualify as an fhc  a bank holding company s subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act  herein referred to as cra  examination rating 
non qualifying bank holding companies are limited to activities that were permissible under the bhca as of november  also  effective on march   the glb act changed the powers of national banks and their subsidiaries  and made similar changes in the powers of state chartered banks and their subsidiaries 
national banks may now underwrite  deal in and purchase state and local revenue bonds 
subsidiaries of national banks may now engage in financial activities that the bank cannot itself engage in  except for general insurance underwriting and real estate development and investment 
in order for a subsidiary of a national bank to engage in these new financial activities  the national bank and its depository institution affiliates must be well capitalized  have at least satisfactory general  managerial and cra examination ratings  and meet other qualification requirements relating to total assets  subordinated debt  capital  risk management  and affiliate transactions 
subsidiaries of state chartered banks can exercise the same powers as national bank subsidiaries if they satisfy the same qualifying rules that apply to national banks  except that state chartered banks do not have to satisfy the managerial and debt rating requirements applicable to national banks 
the glb act also reformed the overall regulatory framework of the financial services industry 
in order to implement its underlying purposes  the glb act preempted conflicting state laws that would restrict the types of financial affiliations that are authorized or permitted under the glb act  subject to specified exceptions for state insurance laws and regulations 
with regard to securities laws  effective may   the glb act removed the current blanket exemption for banks from being considered brokers or dealers under the securities exchange act of and replaced it with a number of more limited exemptions 
thus  previously exempted banks may become subject to the broker dealer registration and supervision requirements of the securities exchange act of the exemption that prevented bank holding companies and banks that advised mutual funds from being considered investment advisers under the investment advisers act of was also eliminated 
separately  the glb act imposes customer privacy requirements on any company engaged in financial activities 
under these requirements  a financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of customer nonpublic personal information 
also  for customers that obtain a financial product such as a loan for personal  family or household purposes  a financial company is required to disclose its privacy policy to the customer at the time the relationship is established and annually thereafter  including its policies concerning the sharing of the customer s nonpublic personal information with affiliates and third parties 
if an exemption is not available  a financial company must provide consumers with a notice of its information sharing practices that allows the consumer to reject the disclosure of its nonpublic personal information to third parties 
third parties that receive such information are subject to the same restrictions as the financial company on the reuse of the information 
finally  a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an account number or similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail 
risk based capital guidelines general 
the federal banking agencies have established minimum capital standards known as risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a new definition of capital and a framework for calculating the amount of capital that must be maintained against a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
the amount of capital required to be maintained is based upon the credit risks associated with the various types of a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
a bank s assets and off balance sheet items are classified under several risk categories  with each category assigned a particular risk weighting from to 
the bank s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital  which is the numerator of the ratio  by the combined risk weights of its asserts and off balance sheet items  which is the denominator of the ratio 
qualifying capital 
a bank s total qualifying capital consists of two types of capital components core capital elements  known as tier capital  and supplementary capital elements  known as tier capital 
the tier component of a bank s qualifying capital must represent at least of total qualifying capital and may consist of the following items that are defined as core capital elements common stockholders equity  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 
the tier component of a bank s total qualifying capital may consist of the following items a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses  certain types of perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  certain types of hybrid capital instruments and mandatory convertible debt securities  and a portion of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  including related surplus 
risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk classifications  according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
the aggregate dollar value of the amount in each risk classification is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that classification 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk classifications are added together 
this total is the bank s total risk weighted assets 
a two step process determines risk weights for off balance sheet items  such as unfunded loan commitments  letters of credit and recourse arrangements 
first  the credit equivalent amount of the off balance sheet items is determined  in most cases by multiplying the off balance sheet item by a credit conversion factor 
second  the credit equivalent amount is treated like any balance sheet asset and is assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
this result is added to the bank s risk weighted assets and comprises the denominator of the risk based capital ratio 
minimum capital standards 
the supervisory standards set forth below specify minimum capital ratios based primarily on broad risk considerations 
the risk based ratios do not take explicit account of the quality of individual asset portfolios or the range of other types of risks to which banks may be exposed  such as interest rate  liquidity  market or operational risks 
for this reason  banks are generally expected to operate with capital positions above the minimum ratios 
all banks are required to meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of 
at least must be in the form of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the maximum amount of supplementary capital elements that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
in addition  the combined maximum amount of subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the maximum amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of gross risk weighted asserts 
the allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of this limit may  of course  be maintained  but would not be included in a bank s risk based capital calculation 
the federal banking agencies also require all banks to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a bank rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
for all banks not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio must be at least to 
these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios apply across the industry 
regulators  however  have the discretion to set minimum capital requirements for individual institutions  which may be significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
in march  goleta entered into a written agreement with the occ to maintain a risk based capital and a tier i capital ratio 
see agreement with the occ 
other factors affecting minimum capital standards the federal banking agencies have established certain benchmark ratios of loan loss reserves to be held against classified assets 
the benchmark by federal banking agencies is the sum of of assets classified loss  of assets classified doubtful  of assets classified substandard  and estimated credit losses on other assets over the upcoming twelve months 
the federal banking agencies have recently revised their risk based capital rules to take account of concentrations of credit and the risks of engaging in non traditional activities 
concentrations of credit refers to situations where a lender has a relatively large proportion of loans involving a single borrower  industry  geographic location  collateral or loan type 
non traditional activities are considered those that have not customarily been part of the banking business  but are conducted by a bank as a result of developments in  for example  technology  financial markets or other additional activities permitted by law or regulation 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards 
the federal banking agencies also are authorized to review an institution s management of concentrations of credit risk for adequacy and consistency with safety and soundness standards regarding internal controls  credit underwriting or other operational and managerial areas 
the federal banking agencies also limit the amount of deferred tax assets that are allowable in computing a bank s regulatory capital 
deferred tax assets that can be realized for taxes paid in prior carry back years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are generally not limited 
however  deferred tax assets that can only be realized through future taxable earnings are limited for regulatory capital purposes to the lessor of the amount that can be realized within one year of the quarter end report date  or of tier capital 
the amount of any deferred tax in excess of this limit would be excluded from tier capital  total assets and regulatory capital calculations 
the federal banking agencies have also adopted a joint agency policy statement which provides that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank s interest rate risk management process  and the level of its interest rate exposure is a critical factor in the evaluation of the bank s capital adequacy 
a bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions 
financial institutions which have significant amounts of their assets concentrated in high risk loans or nontraditional banking activities  and who fail to adequately manage these risks  may be required to set aside capital in excess of the regulatory minimums 
prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks 
each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a bank shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  has a leverage capital ratio of or more  and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  and a leverage capital ratio of or more under certain circumstances and does not meet the definition of well capitalized  undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage capital ratio that is less than under certain circumstances  significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage capital ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
banks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if  after making the payment the bank would be undercapitalized  that is  the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks 
banks classified as undercapitalized are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company  if any 
broad regulatory authority was granted with respect to significantly undercapitalized banks  including forced mergers  growth restrictions  ordering new elections for directors  forcing divestiture by its holding company  if any  requiring management changes  and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management 
even more severe restrictions are applicable to critically undercapitalized banks  those with capital at or less than 
restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator after days  even if the bank is still solvent 
all of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action 
a bank  based upon its capital levels  that is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat an institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment 
deposit insurance assessments the fdic has implemented a risk based assessment system in which the deposit insurance premium relates to the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss 
the fdic sets semi annual assessments in an amount necessary to maintain or increase the reserve ratio of the insurance fund to at least of insured deposits or a higher percentage as determined to be justified by the fdic 
under the risk based assessment system adopted by the fdic  banks are categorized into one of three capital categories  well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized 
assignment of a bank into a particular capital category is based on supervisory evaluations by its primary federal regulator 
after being assigned to a particular capital category  a bank is classified into one of three supervisory categories 
the three supervisory categories are group a financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses  group b demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration  and group c poses a substantial probability of loss 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
the assessment rates are summarized below  expressed in terms of cents per in insured deposits assessment rates supervisory group capital group group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized interstate banking and branching banks have the ability  subject to specific restrictions  to acquire by acquisition or merger branches located outside their home state 
the establishment of new interstate branches is also possible in those states with laws that expressly permit it 
interstate branches are subject to many of the laws of the states in which they are located 
california law authorizes out of state banks to enter california by the acquisition of or merger with a california bank that has been in existence for at least five years  unless the california bank is in danger of failing or in certain other emergency situations 
interstate branching into california is  however  limited to the acquisition of an existing bank 
enforcement powers in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses  or for violation of any law  rule  regulation  condition imposed in writing by the regulatory agency  or term of a written agreement with the regulatory agency 
enforcement actions may include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of the bank s deposit insurance  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the deposit insurance fund or the bank would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
fdic receivership the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of any insured bank or savings association 
in addition  the fdic may appoint itself as sole conservator or receiver of any insured state bank or savings association for any  among others  of the following reasons insolvency  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to any violation of law or regulation or any unsafe or unsound practice  an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  including substantially insufficient capital or otherwise  any willful violation of a cease and desist order which has become final  any concealment of books  papers  records or assets of the institution  the likelihood that the institution will not be able to meet the demands of its depositors or pay its obligations in the normal course of business  the incurrence or likely incurrence of losses by the institution that will deplete all or substantially all of its capital with no reasonable prospect for the replenishment of the capital without federal assistance  or any violation of any law or regulation  or an unsafe or unsound practice or condition which is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings  or is likely to weaken the condition of the institution or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of its depositors 
as a receiver of any insured depository institution  the fdic may liquidate such institution in an orderly manner and dispose of any matter concerning such institution as the fdic determines is in the best interests of that institution  its depositors and the fdic 
further  the fdic shall  as the conservator or receiver  by operation of law  succeed to all rights  titles  powers and privileges of the insured institution  and of any shareholder  member  account holder  depositor  officer or director of that institution with respect to the institution and the assets of the institution  may take over the assets of and operate the institution with all the powers of the members or shareholders  directors and the officers of the institution and conduct all business of the institution  collect all obligations and money due to the institution and preserve and conserve the assets and property of the institution 
safety and soundness guidelines the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
these guidelines establish operational and managerial standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  asset growth  and compensation  fees and benefits additionally  the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
if an institution fails to comply with a safety and soundness standard  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan 
failure to submit a compliance plan or to implement an accepted plan may result in a formal enforcement action 
the federal banking agencies have issued regulations prescribing uniform guidelines for real estate lending 
the regulations require insured depository institutions to adopt written policies establishing standards  consistent with such guidelines  for extensions of credit secured by real estate 
the policies must address loan portfolio management  underwriting standards and loan to value limits that do not exceed the supervisory limits prescribed by the regulations 
consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature  and insured institutions have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
banks are subject to many federal consumer protection laws and their regulations  including the cra  the truth in lending act the tila  the fair housing act the fh act  the equal credit opportunity act the ecoa  the home mortgage disclosure act the hmda  and the real estate settlement procedures act the respa 
the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank s compliance with its cra obligations on a performance based evaluation system 
this system bases cra ratings on an institution s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
the ecoa prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
in march the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in lending 
the policy statement describes the three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
this means that if a creditor s actions have had the effect of discriminating  the creditor may be held liable even when there is no intent to discriminate 
the fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate against any person in its housing related lending activities because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap  or familial status 
the fh act is broadly written and has been broadly interpreted by the courts 
a number of lending practices have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
among those practices that have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act are declining a loan for the purposes of racial discrimination  making excessively low appraisals of property based on racial considerations  pressuring  discouraging  or denying applications for credit on a prohibited basis  using excessively burdensome qualifications standards for the purpose or with the effect of denying housing to minority applicants  imposing on minority loan applicants more onerous interest rates or other terms  conditions or requirements  and racial steering  or deliberately guiding potential purchasers to or away from certain areas because of race 
the tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology and expressions of rates  the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total payments and the payment schedule 
hmda grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods 
one purpose of hmda is to provide public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
hmda requires institutions to report data regarding applications for one to four family real estate loans  home improvement loans  and multifamily loans  as well as information concerning originations and purchases of those types of loans 
federal bank regulators rely  in part  upon data provided under hmda to determine whether depository institutions engage in discriminatory lending practices 
respa requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
violations of these various consumer protection laws and regulations can result in civil liability to the aggrieved party  regulatory enforcement including civil money penalties  and even punitive damages 
other aspects of banking law goleta is also subject to federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions covering  among other things  security procedures  currency and foreign transactions reporting  insider and affiliated party transactions  management interlocks  electronic funds transfers  funds availability  and truth in savings 
there are also a variety of federal statutes which regulate acquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies 
impact of monetary policies banking is a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest rate earned on its loans  securities and other interest earning assets comprises the major source of goleta s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond goleta s control and  accordingly  the earnings and growth of goleta are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  including inflation  recession  and unemployment  and also to the influence of monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy  such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession  by open market dealings in united states government securities  adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  placing limitations upon savings and time deposit interest rates  and adjusting the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the federal reserve system the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates 
the nature and timing of any future changes in the frb s policies and their impact on the company and goleta cannot be predicted  however  depending on the degree to which our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are rate sensitive  increases in rates would have a temporary effect of increasing our net interest margin  while decreases in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting our net income 
formal agreement with the occ in march  goleta entered into an agreement the formal agreement with its principal regulator  the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ 
the formal agreement requires that goleta maintain certain capital levels and adhere to certain operational and reporting requirements  including the following submitting monthly progress reports  adopting a written asset diversification program to identify and control any concentration of credit  maintaining total capital at least equal to of risk weighted assets and tier capital at least equal to of adjusted total assets and developing a three year capital program to maintain adequate capital and raise any required additional capital  including a prohibition on the payment of dividends without the approval of the occ  refrain from permitting its average total assets in any quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding quarter except as specified  establishing a program to maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  ensuring that it has adequate  full time management  adopting a written strategic plan covering at least a three year period  developing a written risk management program  refiling certain amended regulatory reports and adopting policies and procedures to ensure that all regulatory reports accurately reflect its condition  adopting a written program to ensure compliance with all applicable consumer protection laws  rules and regulations  appointing a capable officer vested with sufficient authority to ensure compliance with the bank secrecy act  documenting the support used to value loans held on its books  servicing rights and interest only assets  preparing a written analysis of its short term consumer loan program which fully assesses the risks and benefits of this program and  thereafter  preparing a written analysis of any new product or service  and correcting each violation of law  rule or regulation cited in any report of examination 
compliance with the provisions of the formal agreement could limit goleta s business activity and increase expense 
management has been informed by the regulators that they do not believe that goleta is in full compliance with the following provisions of the formal agreement implementing and demonstrating the effectiveness of its written risk management program  implementing a program to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws applicable to goleta s short term consumer loan program  accurately valuing  and documenting the valuations of  interest only assets  servicing assets  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations  particularly as related to the short term consumer loan program 
goleta achieved and maintained both of the aforementioned required and capital ratios from september  to the end of as the result of fourth quarter losses  goleta s risk based capital ratio declined to at december  on march   the company made a  capital contribution to goleta  which would have increased goleta s risk based capital ratio to at december   had the contribution been made on that date 
regulators have asserted that failure to comply with the provisions of the formal agreement could adversely affect the safety or soundness of goleta 
the occ possesses broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action and bring enforcement actions to resolve unsafe or unsound practices 
memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank in march  the company entered into an agreement the memorandum of understanding with its principal regulator  the federal reserve bank of san francisco the reserve bank 
the memorandum of understanding requires that the company maintain certain capital levels and adhere to certain operational and reporting requirements  including the following refrain from declaring any dividends or redeeming any of its stock without the approval of the reserve bank  adopting a written plan to maintain a sufficient capital position for the consolidated organization  refrain from increasing its borrowings or incurring or renewing any debt without the approval of the reserve bank  correcting any violations of applicable laws  rules or regulations and developing a written program to ensure compliance in the future  developing written policies and procedures to strengthen the company s records  systems and internal controls  developing a written plan to enhance management information systems and the board of director s supervision of operations  developing a written consolidated strategic plan  developing a written plan to address weaknesses in the company s audit program  complying with applicable laws with respect to the appointment of any new directors or the hiring of any senior executive officers  and submitting quarterly progress reports 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses caused by future interest rate change 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the risks 
the company s exposure to market risks is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
tools used by management include the standard gap report and interest rate shock analysis 
the company has no market risk instruments held for trading purposes except for its interest only strips 
management believes the company s market risk is reasonable at this time 
the company currently does not enter into derivative financial instruments

f community west bancshares notes to consolidated financial statements december  summary of significant accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of community west bancshares  a california corporation  and its wholly owned subsidiary  goleta national bank goleta  herein referred to as the company  are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and general practices within the financial services industry 
all material intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated 
the following are descriptions of the most significant of those policies nature of operations the company s primary operations are related to traditional banking and financial services through goleta which include the acceptance of deposits and the lending and investing of money 
the company also engages in electronic banking services 
the company s customers consist of small to mid sized businesses  as well as individuals 
the company also originates and sells u 
s 
small business administration sba and first and second mortgage loans through its normal operations and seventeen loan production offices 
business combinations and dispositions on december   the company acquired palomar community bank then known as palomar savings and loan palomar 
as of that date  shareholders of palomar became shareholders of the company by receiving shares of community west bancshares stock for each share of palomar stock they held 
this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
on august   the company sold palomar community bank to centennial first financial services for million 
the sale reflects a gain of  that has been recorded in the company s statement of operations 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of reporting cash flows  cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  amounts due from banks  and federal funds sold 
generally  federal funds are sold for one day periods 
reserve requirements all depository institutions are required by law to maintain reserves on transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits in the form of cash balances at the federal reserve bank 
these reserve requirements can be offset by cash balances held at the company 
at december  and  the company s cash balance was sufficient to offset the federal reserve requirement 
investment securities the company classifies as held to maturity those debt securities it has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
securities held to maturity are accounted for at amortized cost 
debt securities to be held for indefinite periods of time  but not necessarily to be held to maturity or on a long term basis  are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of any applicable income taxes 
realized gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale  if any  are determined on a specific identification basis 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities 
declines in the fair value of available for sale or held to maturity securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary  if any  are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
f interest only strips and servicing assets the company originates certain loans for the purpose of selling either a portion of  or the entire loan  into the secondary market 
fha title loans and the guaranteed portion of sba loans are sold into the secondary market 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income 
also  at the time of the loan sale  it is the company s policy to recognize the related gain on the loan sale in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics and its own prepayment experience in estimating the expected life of the loans 
management periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based and experienced assumptions 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual loan  to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the loan 
on sba loan sales  the company also retains interest only i o strips  which represent the present value of excess net cash flows generated by the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the company determines the present value of this estimated cash flow at the time each loan sale transaction closes  utilizing valuation assumptions as to discount rate  prepayment rate and default rate appropriate for each particular transaction 
the i o strips are accounted for like investments in debt securities classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company records the i o s at fair value with the resulting increase or decrease in fair value being recorded through operations in the current period 
for the years ended december   and  net unrealized losses gains of   and  respectively  are included in results of operations 
loans held for sale loans which are originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value determined on an aggregate basis 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income 
loans held for sale are primarily comprised of sba loans  second mortgage loans  and residential mortgage loans 
funding for sba programs depends on annual appropriations by the us congress  and accordingly  the continued sale of loans under these programs is dependent on the continuation of such programs 
at december  and  the company did not incur a lower of cost or market provision 
loans held for investment generally  loans are stated at amounts advanced less payments collected 
interest on loans is accrued daily on a simple interest basis 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan  generally at the time the loan is days delinquent  unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time 
thereafter  interest income is no longer recognized on the loan 
as such  interest income may be recognized on impaired loans to the extent they are not past due by days or more 
interest on non accrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
securitized loans and bonds payable in and  respectively  the company transferred million and million in loans to special purpose trusts the trusts 
the transfers have been accounted for as secured borrowings with a pledge of collateral  and accordingly the mortgage loans and related bonds issued are included in the company s balance sheet 
the transferred loans are classified on the balance sheet as securitized loans and the bonds issued in connection with securitized loans are classified as bonds payable 
such loans are accounted for in the same manner as loans held to maturity 
deferred debt issuance costs and bond discount related to the bonds are amortized on a method which approximates the level yield basis over the estimated life of the bonds 
loan fees and costs loan origination fees  certain direct origination costs  purchase premiums and discounts  are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the loan yield over the life of the loan using the level yield method 
f provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb known and inherent probable losses on existing loans through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the allowance is charged for losses when management believes that full recovery on loans is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio  which take into consideration such factors as changes in the growth  size and composition of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  collateral  guarantees and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and or the value of the underlying collateral 
these estimates depend on the outcome of future events and  therefore  contain inherent uncertainties 
in addition  as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies  periodically review the goleta s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require goleta to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management 
management believes the level of the allowance for loan losses as of december   is adequate to absorb known and inherent probable losses  however  changes in the local economy  the ability of borrowers to repay amounts borrowed and other factors may result in the need to increase the allowance through charges to earnings 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include  payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays or payment shortfalls on a case by case basis 
when determining the possibility of impairment  management considers all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the securitized loans and short term consumer loans  which are collectively evaluated for impairment 
other real estate owned real estate acquired by foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
operating expenses or income  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged to current operations 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives  whichever is shorter 
intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill  which was recorded as the excess of the purchase price of palomar over the fair value of net assets acquired  and core deposit intangible  which was recorded as the long term deposit relationships resulting from deposit liabilities assumed in an acquisition 
goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  not to exceed years 
core deposit intangible was amortized using a method that approximates the expected run off of the deposit base  which averaged years 
the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful lives or the recoverability of the remaining balance of the intangible assets 
an asset is deemed impaired if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset and any excess of the carrying value over fair value will be written off through a charge to current operations 
in august of  the company sold palomar community bank to centennial first financial services for million in cash 
accumulated amortization of intangible assets was and  as of december  and  respectively 
f income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax effect of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets  if based on weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
earnings per share earnings loss per share basic is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year divided into net income 
earnings loss per share diluted  is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year plus the dilutive effect  if any  of outstanding warrants and options divided into net income 
earnings loss per share for the year ended december  basic weighted average shares outstanding    dilutive effect of stock options   diluted weighted average shares outstanding    net income loss    earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted stock options on  shares in and  in were excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share because they are anti dilutive 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas was subsequently amended by sfas no

the statements require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allow a derivative s gain and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting

loan sales and servicing sba loan sales the company sells the guaranteed portion of sba loans into the secondary market  on a servicing retained basis  in exchange for cash  retained servicing assets  and i o strips 
fair value of the i o strips and servicing assets was determined using a discount rate based on the term of the underlying loan instrument  and a prepayment rate at december  an estimated discount rate and an prepayment rate was utilized at december  as of december   the company had  in sba loans held for sale 
f fha title loan sales the company has retained servicing rights on fha title loans sold in the secondary market from to at december  and  the fair value of the related servicing asset was estimated using a weighted average prepayment rate of

securitized loans the company originates and purchases second mortgage loans that allow borrowers to borrow up to of their home s appraised value  when combined with the balance of the first mortgage loan  up to a maximum loan of  proceeds are commonly used for debt consolidation  home improvement  or school tuition 
during  the company sold these loans for cash to third parties  servicing released 
f in and  the company transferred million and million  respectively  of these loans to two special purpose trusts 
these loans were both originated and purchased by the company 
the trusts  then sold bonds to third party investors which were secured by the transferred loans 
the loans and bonds are held in the trusts independent of the company  the trustee of which oversees the distributions to the bondholders 
the mortgage loans are serviced by a third party the servicer  who receives a stated servicing fee 
there is an insurance policy on the bonds that guarantees the payment of the bonds 
as part of the securitization agreements  the company received an option to repurchase the bonds when the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans sold declined to or less of the original balance of mortgage loans securitized 
because the company has a call option to reacquire the loans transferred and did not retain the servicing rights  the company has not surrendered effective control over the loans transferred 
therefore  the securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings with a pledge of collateral 
accordingly  the company consolidates the trusts and the financial statements of the company

interest collected each month on the mortgage loans will generally exceed the amount of interest accrued on the bonds 
a portion of such excess interest will initially be distributed as principal to the bonds 
as a result of such principal distributions  the excess of the unpaid principal balance of the loans over the unpaid principal balance of the bonds overcollateralization will generally increase 
the securitization agreements require that a certain level of overcollateralization be maintained 
once the required level has been reached  excess interest will no longer be used to accelerate the amortization of the bonds 
whenever the level of overcollateralization falls below the required level  excess interest will again be paid as principal to the bonds until the required level has been re established 
excess interest that is not paid to the bonds is used to make certain other payments or is passed through to the company 
as a result of excess interest payments  the bonds are expected to pay off prior to the stated maturity date

financial statements with off balance sheet risk the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
at december  and  the company had commitments to extend credit of approximately  and  respectively  including obligations to extend standby letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements 
all guarantees are short term and expire within one year 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for extending loan facilities to customers 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
loans sold the company has sold loans that are guaranteed or insured by government agencies for which the company retains all servicing rights and responsibilities 
the company is required to perform certain monitoring functions in connection with these loans to preserve the guarantee by the government agency and prevent loss to the company in the event of nonperformance by the borrower 
management believes that the company is in compliance with these requirements 
the outstanding balance of the sold portion of such loans was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
f although the company sells without recourse substantially all of the mortgage loans it originates or purchases  the company retains a substantial degree of risk relating to the servicing activities and retained interest in sold sba loans 
in addition  during the period of time that the loans are held for sale  the company is subject to various business risks associated with the lending business  including borrower default  foreclosure  and the risk that a rapid increase in interest rates would result in a decline of the value of loans held for sale to potential purchasers 
in connection with its loan sales  the company enters agreements which generally require the company to repurchase or substitute loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by the company to the loan purchaser  any misrepresentation during the mortgage loan origination process or  in some cases  upon any fraud or early default on such mortgage loans 
the company s ability to originate  purchase and sell loans is also significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates may also reduce the amount of loan and commitment fees received by the company 
a significant decline in interest rates could also decrease the size of the company s servicing portfolio and the related servicing income by increasing the level of prepayments 
the company does not currently utilize any specific hedging instruments to minimize exposure to fluctuations in the market price of loans and interest rates with regard to loans held for sale in the secondary mortgage market 
therefore  between the time the company originates and sells the loans  the company is exposed to decreases in the market price of such loans due to increases in interest rates 
salary continuation the company entered into a salary continuation agreement with a former officer and director 
the agreement provides monthly cash payments to the officer or beneficiaries in the event of death or disability  beginning in the month after retirement date or death and extending for a period of fifteen years 
the company purchased a life insurance policy as an investment 
the income from the policy investment will help offset this liability 
the cash surrender value of the policy was  and  at december  and  respectively  and is included in other assets 
the present value of the company s liability under the agreement is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company also has two key man life insurance policies 
the combined cash surrender value of the policies are  and  at december  and  respectively 
litigation the following sections summarize the company s significant legal proceedings 
former accountants in october  the company filed a lawsuit against its former accountants alleging deficient consulting and audit services that led to the restatement of the company s financial statements and ultimately to an impairment of capital 
in april  the company settled the lawsuit and received million in cash 
the proceeds are reflected as other income for financial reporting purposes 
the company also incurred  in legal and professional fees in connection with the litigation which are included as other expenses 
short term consumer lending goleta makes short term consumer loans bank loans using certain marketing and servicing assistance of ace at almost all of ace s retail locations pursuant to the terms of a master loan agency agreement between ace and goleta the goleta agreement 
a number of lawsuits and state regulatory proceedings have been filed or initiated against goleta and or ace regarding the bank loans 
a key issue in the existing lawsuits and state regulatory proceedings concerning the bank loans is whether goleta or ace is properly regarded as the lender 
goleta and ace maintain that  as provided by the legal documentation and marketing materials for the bank loans  goleta is the lender and that  because goleta is a national bank located in california  the bank loans  including the interest that may legally be charged  should be governed by federal and california law 
the opposing parties in most of these lawsuits and regulatory proceedings  however  maintain that ace should be regarded as the lender  because of the services it renders to goleta under the goleta agreement and ace s purchase of participation interests in the bank loans  and that the bank loans  including interest that may legally be charged  should be governed by the laws of the respective states in which the borrowers reside 
if ace were held to be the lender  then the interest charged for the bank loans would violate most of the applicable states f usury laws  which impose maximum rates of interest or finance charges that a non bank lender may charge 
the consequences to the company of such a holding in any lawsuit or regulatory proceeding would depend on the applicable state s usury and consumer protection laws and on the basis for a finding of violation of those laws 
those consequences could include the company s obligation to refund interest collected on the illegal bank loans  to refund the principal amount of the illegal bank loans  to pay treble or other multiple damages  to pay monetary penalties specified by statute  and to cease offering the bank loans at least as theretofore offered 
regarding each lawsuit  that amount would depend upon proof of the allegations  the number or the amount of the loan related transactions during relevant time periods  and for certain of the claims proof of actual damages sustained by the plaintiffs 
the goleta agreement generally provides that ace will be liable for to of the costs and monetary damages  if any  that would be paid to claimants in these actions and goleta will generally be liable for to of such costs and or monetary damages 
however  if the goleta agreement is invalid or unenforceable  or if ace is unable to pay  goleta may be liable for up to the full amount of any and all claims 
adverse determinations in one or more of these actions could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations and continuation of the short term consumer lending business  and could result in adverse actions by the regulatory agencies with authority over goleta and the company  including the occ and the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
the occ has expressed strong reservations about goleta and other national banks entering into arrangements with third parties to make short term consumer loans and has implemented regulatory actions against two of these banks 
in  the company s short term consumer lending program contributed approximately million to indirect and corporate overhead expenses after a provision for loan losses of approximately million 
the occ has expressed strong reservations about this program and believes it subjects goleta and the company to significant strategic  reputational  compliance and transaction risks 
some of these risks include i reliance on the automated processes of ace  ii the difficulty of monitoring transaction volume because of the geographic expanse and number of stores maintained by ace  iii the difficulty of managing an adequate system to ensure compliance by ace with consumer protection laws  iv the importance of this program to the company s growth plans  v the adverse publicity arising from recent lawsuits associated with this program  and vi the risk of loss from such lawsuits 
these risks could have a materially adverse effect on goleta s and the company s results of operations 
the following is a summary of the significant pending litigation relating to the bank loans 
most of the following cases are in their early stages and the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain 
based on advice from legal counsel  management has no reason to believe it probable that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that adverse determinations in one or more of these actions could ultimately have a material adverse financial impact on the company and could also result in adverse actions by the regulatory agencies with authority over goleta 
jennafer long v 
ace cash express  inc 
this lawsuit  originally filed against ace and not goleta in florida state court on behalf of a putative class of florida borrowers  alleges that the bank loans at ace s florida locations should be deemed to be made by ace rather than by goleta and  therefore  that those bank loans violate florida usury laws and florida statutory prohibitions against misrepresentations and deceptive practices 
the plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages  including an amount equal to all interest charged on the bank loans made in florida  the plaintiff s attorneys fees  and court costs 
ace s earlier attempt to remove this case to federal court was unsuccessful and goleta subsequently intervened as a defendant in the lawsuit 
ace and goleta moved to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that  under governing federal law  goleta is entitled to charge interest on the bank loans at the rates permitted under the law of the state of california  where goleta is located 
however  the court denied the motion to dismiss 
notice from ohio department of commerce 
in july  the superintendent of the ohio division of financial institutions the ohio superintendent delivered to ace a notice of intent to issue cease and desist order and notice of opportunity for hearing 
this notice asserts that ace  not goleta  is the lender of the bank loans made in ohio  that those bank loans violate the ohio small loan act and are void  that all finance charges and interest received from those bank loans  as well as the outstanding principal of all such existing bank loans  should be forfeited  and that ace should be f ordered to cease violating the ohio small loan act 
in response to the notice  goleta initiated a lawsuit in federal court against the ohio superintendent seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the ohio superintendent s pursuit of a regulatory action against ace 
the thrust of goleta s action is that  under federal law  the interest charges on the bank loans are governed by california and not ohio law 
in response to this federal court lawsuit  the ohio superintendent agreed to suspend the ohio regulatory proceeding against ace until the federal court rules on goleta s complaint 
the ohio superintendent has moved to dismiss goleta s lawsuit on a series of jurisdictional and procedural grounds 
goleta s motion for a preliminary injunction and the ohio superintendent s motion to dismiss have been largely briefed but no hearing has yet been scheduled

though ace does not admit that it is required to obtain a supervised lender license under the colorado uccc  it has submitted applications for re licensure and has begun discussions with the state regarding resolution of the state s licensing claims 
subject to approval of the ace board of directors and negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement  ace and the state have informally agreed to a settlement of this lawsuit under which ace would make payments to colorado borrowers in exchange for releases  ace would be retroactively licensed to make or broker deferred deposit loans under the colorado uccc  and ace would commence making loans directly to colorado borrowers rather than brokering bank loans on behalf of goleta

other litigation the company is involved in various other litigation of a routine nature which is being handled and defended in the ordinary course of the company s business

regulatory matters the company on a consolidated basis and goleta are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and goleta s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and goleta must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and goleta s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and goleta s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  fdicia  was signed into law on december  fdicia included significant changes to the legal and regulatory environment for insured depository institutions  including reductions in insurance coverage for certain kinds of deposits  increased supervision by the federal regulatory agencies  increased reporting requirements for insured institutions  and new regulations concerning internal controls  accounting  and operations 
the prompt corrective action regulations of fdicia  define specific capital categories based on the institutions capital ratios 
the capital categories  in declining order  are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a core capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
additionally  fdicia imposed in a new tier i risk based capital ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
tier i risk based capital is  primarily  common stock and retained earnings net of goodwill and other intangible assets 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined

goleta has no brokered deposits at december  or in fourth quarter of  the office of the comptroller of currency of the united states of america  herein referred to as the occ  notified goleta that it had incorrectly calculated the amount of regulatory capital required to be held in respect of residual interests retained by goleta in two securitizations of loans that were consummated in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of accordingly  the occ informed goleta that it was significantly undercapitalized at march   june  and september  on november   certain directors of the company made a new debt and equity investment in the company of approximately million

the occ subsequently informed goleta that it was again adequately capitalized 
f in march  goleta entered into an agreement the formal agreement with its principal regulator  the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ 
the formal agreement requires that goleta maintain certain capital levels and adhere to certain operational and reporting requirements  including the following submitting monthly progress reports  adopting a written asset diversification program to identify and control any concentration of credit  maintaining total capital at least equal to of risk weighted assets and tier capital at least equal to of adjusted total assets and developing a three year capital program to maintain adequate capital and raise any required additional capital  including a prohibition on the payment of dividends without the approval of the occ  refrain from permitting its average total assets in any quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding quarter except as specified  establishing a program to maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  ensuring that it has adequate  full time management  adopting a written strategic plan covering at least a three year period  developing a written risk management program  refiling certain amended regulatory reports and adopting policies and procedures to ensure that all regulatory reports accurately reflect its condition  adopting a written program to ensure compliance with all applicable consumer protection laws  rules and regulations  appointing a capable officer vested with sufficient authority to ensure compliance with the bank secrecy act  documenting the support used to value loans held on its books  servicing rights and interest only assets  preparing a written analysis of its short term consumer loan program which fully assesses the risks and benefits of this program and  thereafter  preparing a written analysis of any new product or service  and correcting each violation of law  rule or regulation cited in any report of examination 
f compliance with the provisions of the formal agreement could limit goleta s business activity and increase expense 
management has been informed by the regulators that they do not believe that goleta is in full compliance with the following provisions of the formal agreement implementing and demonstrating the effectiveness of its written risk management program  implementing a program to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws applicable to goleta s short term consumer loan program  accurately valuing  and documenting the valuations of  interest only assets  servicing assets  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations  particularly as related to the short term consumer loan program

regulators have asserted that failure to comply with the provisions of the formal agreement could adversely affect the safety or soundness of goleta
