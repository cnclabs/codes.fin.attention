new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides new guidance on the accounting for a business combination at the date a business combination is completed 
specifically  it requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating use of the pooling of interests method 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective immediately  except with regard to business combinations initiated prior to june  sfas no 
will be effective as of january  goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a business combination completed after july   will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with appropriate pre sfas accounting literature 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
the company does not believe there will be a material effect from the adoption of these new standards 
sfas no 
establishes new guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after a business combination is completed 
among other things  it requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets will no longer be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired 
this statement will apply to existing goodwill and intangible assets beginning with fiscal years starting after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of these provisions 
on august   fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard will apply to the company effective october  the company is currently reviewing the impact of this provision 
on october   fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that replaced fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of this project were to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in statement no 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
statement no 
requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
the provisions of statement no 
will apply to the company effective october  the company is currently reviewing the impact of these provisions
