while the company has operations in canada  mexico and the uk  historically only the operating results in mexico have been materially impacted by currency fluctuations 
there has been a significant devaluation of the mexican peso at least once in each of the last three decades  the last one being in august of in the short term after such devaluations  consumer confidence has been shaken  leading to an immediate reduction in revenues in the months following the devaluation 
then  after the immediate shock  and as the peso stabilizes  revenues tend to grow 
selling prices tend to rise over the long term to offset any inflationary increases in costs 
the peso  as well as any currency value  depends on many factors including international trade  investor confidence and government policy  to name a few 
these factors are impossible for the company to predict  and thus  an estimate of potential effect on results of operations for the future cannot be made

current economic environment and events although not directly impacted by recent events in the us and abroad  softening economic conditions could affect the retail mass or other markets served by the company s consumer group and thus could lead to reduced overall revenues 
in addition  certain expenses such as insurance costs could be significantly higher in the coming years than in due to recent events 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated approximately million in cash flows from operating activities in the company s strict inventory control and reduction efforts in the us led to an increase in cash flows related to inventories of approximately  continuing a correction begun in after a million decrease in cash flows attributable to the build up of inventories in in addition  further improvement in accounts payable management in the us and mexico and strong accounts receivable collections in mexico helped to partially offset the effects of higher us accounts receivable in overall  in and  the company generated approximately million in cash flows from operating activities  as compared with net cash used of million in the company s investing activities included approximately million in net purchases of property and equipment  compared to million in the prior year 
this reflects a higher level of purchases as compared with recent years  due to the company s expansion of its mexico manufacturing and consolidation into its newly leased  square foot facility 
in  these expenditures were partially offset by approximately million in net proceeds on the sale of an idled mexico plant and other assets 
a note receivable of million from the sale of a division was collected in and is reflected as proceeds from investing activities 
generally  all major capital projects are discretionary in nature and thus no material purchase commitments exist 
capital expenditures are usually funded from operations and existing financing or new leasing arrangements 
the company s primary financing arrangements are with a consortium of lenders  providing a total of up to million in financing through september the financing agreements  as amended  include a revolving line of credit facility in the amount of million  which bears interest at either the prime rate plus  or the prevailing libor rate plus  through september the agreements also provide for the payment of various bank fees approximating  per month 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company s us and canada operations  subject to reserves for anticipated subordinated debt payments and certain other items  as defined 
the company has executed an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the rate of interest on million of these borrowings at through august the loan and security agreements also include a term loan in the initial amount of million 
the term loan is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest  through september the loan bears interest based upon the same prevailing rate described above in connection with the revolving credit facility 
the company entered into the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements to balance and manage overall interest rate exposure and minimize overall cost of borrowings 
these financing arrangements are collateralized by the tangible and intangible assets of the us and canada operations including accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  patents and trademarks and a pledge of the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the loan and security agreement contains provisions pertaining to the maintenance of certain financial ratios and annual capital expenditure levels  as well as restrictions as to payment of cash dividends 
on september   a waiver of compliance with one provision of the company s primary lending agreement expired and shortly thereafter its senior lenders prohibited the payment of million in principal due to senior subordinated noteholders on september  the payment due date was later extended by the noteholders until november  and the aforementioned waiver from the company s senior lenders was also extended through that date 
these extensions expired on november  the senior lenders again blocked any payment to the subordinated noteholders and the company has continued to negotiate with its various lenders since then 
as of september   the company was not in compliance with two financial covenants under its senior debt agreements and one financial covenant under its subordinated note agreement 
the company has received an additional extension and waiver of certain existing defaults under its senior debt agreements through may  to allow the company more time to address its debt issues to the mutual satisfaction of all parties involved 
the company has asked both its senior and subordinated lenders to amend various provisions of their debt agreements until at least october to allow time for the company to pursue a longer term solution 
as of september   the company had approximately million of unused lines of credit available under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company s mexico subsidiary has million in bank lines of credit million unused as of september  expiring at various dates which bear interest at a rate based upon either a floating us bank rate or the rate of certain mexican government securities 
the company relies heavily on the availability of the lines of credit in the us and mexico for liquidity in its operations 
the company also has outstanding million of senior subordinated notes valued at their face amount  due the subordinated note agreement provides for a total interest rate of through june and through maturity in due to the company s noncompliance under its primary lending arrangements discussed above  it was prohibited from making a scheduled subordinated note payment of million due in september the note agreement provides for an additional interest charge of on this amount until payment is made 
the note agreement  as amended  contains provisions that limit dividends and other payments  and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants and ratios  one of which the company did not comply with as of september  the company believes that amounts available under its lines of credit under its senior debt and under lines of credit available to its mexican subsidiary  if funded  are sufficient to fulfill all current and anticipated operating requirements of its business 
the senior lenders have consistently supported the company and they  as well as the company s foreign lenders  have continued funding under their agreements throughout the ongoing negotiations 
however  the company does not believe it will have excess cash flow to retire the total million in subordinated notes by their due date in the company has asked the subordinated noteholders and they have expressed a willingness to consider restructuring their scheduled principal payments to allow the company sufficient time to retire the notes through the infusion of some form of new equity capital  new secondary financing and or the sale of assets 
however  the company cannot assure that its efforts will be successful  that the subordinated noteholders will amend their scheduled payments and or that it will maintain and or secure new sources of capital 
in addition  the company s mexico subsidiary cannot assure that its lines of credit will continue to be available after their respective expiration dates  or that replacement lines of credit will be secured 
due to the defaults described above  the subordinated and senior debts have been classified as current maturities of long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
moreover  in light of the current circumstances regarding the company s various debt arrangements  the report of the company s independent accountants includes an explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
in march  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the acquisition of up to million in dixon ticonderoga company stock 
under this program  which has been concluded  the company repurchased  shares at a cost of million million in fiscal 
these repurchases were financed through the aforementioned and previous us revolving line of credit facilities 
refer to notes  and to consolidated financial statements for further description of the aforementioned financing arrangements 
the company has retained wachovia securities formerly first union securities and certain other outside consultants to advise and assist it in evaluating certain strategic alternatives  including capital restructuring  mergers and acquisitions  and or other measures designed to resolve the company s issues with its lenders while maximizing shareholder value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed elsewhere  the company is exposed to the following principal market risks ie risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates foreign exchange rates and interest rates on debt 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in its international operations is principally limited to mexico and  to a lesser degree  canada 
approximately of the company s fiscal net revenues were derived in mexico and canada  combined exclusive of intercompany activities 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the business unit s functional local currency 
it is estimated that a change in both the mexican peso and canadian dollar exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by approximately  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because it does not take into account the changes in customer purchasing patterns or any adjustment to the company s financing or operating strategies in response to such a change in rates 
moreover  this measure does not take into account the possibility that these currency rates can move in opposite directions  such that gains from one may offset losses from another 
in addition  the company s cash flows and earnings are subject to changes in interest rates 
as of september   approximately of total short and long term debt is fixed  at rates between and 
the balance of the company debt is variable  principally based upon the prevailing us bank prime rate or libor rate 
an interest rate swap  which expires in  fixes the rate of interest on million of this debt at 
a change in the average prevailing interest rates of the remaining debt of would have an estimated impact of  upon the company s pre tax results of operations and cash flows 
this quantitative measure does not take into account the possibility that the prevailing rates us bank prime and libor can move in opposite directions and that the company has  in most cases  the option to elect either as the determining interest rate factor
