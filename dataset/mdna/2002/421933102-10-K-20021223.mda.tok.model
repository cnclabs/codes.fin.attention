item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s financial statements  including the following net patient service revenues the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs and from managed care health plans 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid revenues  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce the charges to these patients to estimated receipts based upon the programs principles of payment reimbursement either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final settlements under these government programs are subject to administrative review and audit  and provision is currently made for adjustments which may result 
provisions for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based primarily on the payment terms of contractual arrangements such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
historical collection rates  law changes and changes in contract terms are closely monitored to be certain that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments could be different from the amounts estimated and recorded in the contractual provisions included in these financial statements 
provision for doubtful accounts the collection of receivables from third party payers and patients is the company s primary source of cash and is critical to its operating performance 
the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid  but patient responsibility amounts generally deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
provisions for doubtful accounts are estimated based primarily upon the age of patients account  the patients economic ability to pay and the effectiveness of collection efforts 
accounts receivable balances are routinely reviewed in conjunction with historical collection rates and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of patient accounts when considering the adequacy of the amounts recorded as reserves for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payer mix  business office operations  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect the company s collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying values of long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment of value 
in performing the review of asset impairment  management calculates future cash flows expected to result from these assets and determines whether the asset is impaired 
significant judgments are required by management in determining these future cash flows as well as determining whether the asset is impaired 
income taxes management must make estimates in recording the company s provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
management believes that future income will enable the company to realize these benefits in the future and  therefore  has not recorded any valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
the company operates in multiple states with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns 
the company s federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through fiscal year  which resulted in no material adjustments 
management must make estimates to determine that tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential audit adjustments 
professional liability insurance claims through september   the company insured for its professional liability risks under a claims made basis policy  whereby each claim is covered up to million per occurrence  subject to a  deductible with an annual deductible cap of million 
liabilities in excess of these amounts are covered through a combination of limits provided by commercial insurance companies and a self insurance program 
accruals for self insured professional liability risks are determined using asserted and unasserted claims identified by the company s incident reporting system and actuarially determined estimates based on company and industry historical loss payment patterns and have been discounted to their present value using a discount rate of 
although the ultimate settlement of these accruals may vary from these estimates  management believes that the amounts provided in the company s consolidated financial statements are adequate 
if actual payments of claims exceed projected estimates of claims  the company s insurance accruals could be materially adversely affected 
effective october   in response to difficulty in obtaining primary insurance from commercial companies at reasonable rates  the company formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary in order to self insure a greater portion of its primary professional and general liability risk 
the captive subsidiary reinsures risk up to million per claim and million in the aggregate per hospital  and further acts as an excess insurer for all hospitals in combination with three commercial insurance companies

legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which will continue to limit payment increases under these programs 
however  the company believes that these continued changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future revenue or liquidity 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments might  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care in the united states and the continued rise in managed care programs could have an effect on the company s future revenue and liquidity
