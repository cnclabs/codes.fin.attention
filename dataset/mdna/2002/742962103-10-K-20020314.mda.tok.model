item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview privatebancorp was organized as a delaware corporation in to serve as the holding company for a chicago based de novo  or start up  bank 
our flagship downtown chicago location opened in we expanded to wilmette in north suburban cook county in and the oak brook facility in west suburban dupage county was established in we established the st 
charles office in january  in connection with our purchase of towne square financial corporation a company which was in the process of forming a de novo bank on august  on february   we consummated our acquisition of johnson bank illinois adding two additional locations of the privatebank chicago in lake forest and winnetka  illinois 
during the second quarter  we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on june   privatebancorp capitalized the privatebank st 
louis 
in may  the privatebank chicago opened a second branch in the fox valley area in geneva  illinois 
since year end to december   we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of to billion 
during the same period  loans have grown at a compound annual rate of to million  deposits at a compound annual rate of to million and trust assets under administration at a compound annual rate of to million 
diluted earnings per share eps have grown at a compound annual rate of to since year end for financial information regarding our four separate lines of business  the privatebank chicago  the privatebank st 
louis  wealth management services and holding company activities  see note operating segments to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included on page f the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of net security gains and wealth management fee income  and to a lesser extent  fees for ancillary banking services 
non interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels 
this is largely the result of the profile of our typical client 
our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks 
because average balances tend to be high  we do not earn the high service charge income typical of many retail banks 
non interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations 
our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories 
profitability and expense ratios were negatively impacted in due to the start up operation in st 
charles  the acquisition of johnson bank illinois  and the opening of the privatebank st 
louis 
during we were impacted by the start up nature of operations in st 
louis  and to a lesser extent  by the new office in geneva  illinois 
the privatebank st 
louis began to operate profitably during the fourth quarter of and will have a positive impact on our profitability in during we expect profitability and expense ratios to improve relative to the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
reference should also be made to our accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain critical policies involve estimates and assumptions by management 
by their nature  changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  as described in both management s discussion and analysis and in the financial statement notes  is of particular significance to us 
in addition  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires an annual impairment test of goodwill 
currently  goodwill is recorded at its estimated net realizable value as discussed in notes o 
and q 
to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations net income our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  excluding one time charges  our earnings were million  or per diluted share  in our earnings per share increased as compared to the prior year earnings per share  adjusted to exclude the one time charges 
net income for the year ended december  included a previously announced one time charge of  after tax  or per diluted share  comprised of severance packages for two departing executives as well as amounts incurred to secure their replacements 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   included an acquisition charge of million after tax  or per diluted share  related to the acquisition of towne square financial corporation in st 
charles  illinois and the start up expenses of the privatebank st 
louis 
the earnings growth of between and is due to growth in net interest income  reflecting higher average loan balances and improvement in net interest margin  and growth in non interest income mainly from wealth management services  offset by higher operating expenses 
net income in includes the financial results of the former johnson bank illinois locations subsequent to their acquisition on february  excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and acquisition interest expense associated with the transaction  the two offices located in winnetka and lake forest contributed million to our net income in excluding the towne square financial corporation acquisition related charge and st

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings 
net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
interest income includes loan origination fees recorded from loans 
interest expense includes amortization of prepaid fees on brokered deposits and trust preferred securities 
the volume of non interest bearing funds  largely comprised of demand deposits and capital  also affects the net interest margin 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets 
average earning assets for were million compared to million for  an increase of 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
a changing interest rate environment has an effect on our net interest margin 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is based on floating interest rates and will likely reprice faster than our deposits and floating rate borrowings 
during  we experienced net interest margin pressure as compared to due to the decrease in market interest rates that occurred throughout in addition  during our floating rate assets repriced faster than our deposits and floating rate deposits 
also  we continued to utilize brokered deposit transactions as part of our asset liability management strategy 
these brokered deposits have staggered maturities and provide a lower costing source of funding 
during  we expect our net interest margin to improve if market interest rates increase relative to levels 
alternatively  if market interest rates decrease  we expect our net interest margin to continue to decrease 
net interest income was million during the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets and  to a lesser extent  improvement in net interest spread 
average earning assets during were million compared to million for  an increase of 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
although the rising interest rate environment which was in effect during the first six months of had the effect of improving the yield on average earning assets during as compared to  the rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds also increased in as compared to  resulting in reduced net interest spread for as compared to the decrease in net interest margin is primarily attributable to an increase in borrowed funds utilized to complete the johnson bank illinois acquisition and to capitalize the privatebank st 
louis 
the effect of non interest bearing deposits added basis points to net interest margin

non accrual loans are included in the average balances and do not have a material effect on the average yield 
interest on non accruing loans was not material for the periods presented 
the following table shows the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense by major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities attributable to changes in volume or rate or a mix of both  for the periods indicated  calculated on a tax equivalent basis

the provision for loan losses reflects management s latest assessment of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for probable loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the reserve 
our analysis is influenced by the following factors the volume and quality of loans and commitments in the portfolio  loss experience  and economic conditions 
a discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based begins on page our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in increases in the provision for loan losses for as compared to are related to growth in the loan portfolio

our provision for loan loss was million in and we recognized  of net charge offs during non interest income non interest income increased approximately million or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in non interest income is attributable primarily to million of net gains on the sale of investment securities 
volatility in interest rates during provided us with the opportunity to sell available for sale securities for gains and replace the sold securities with securities that reflect better risk reward parameters and greater return opportunities 
banking service charge income increased by  over the prior year 
wealth management fee revenue increased to million in compared to million in trust assets under administration decreased to million at year end  compared to million at december  attributable primarily to declines in equity valuations since the prior year  which was partially offset by increases in new business generated during the year 
non interest income increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to increases in service charge income and wealth management fee revenues 
banking service charge income increased by  over the prior year due primarily to fees earned on accounts related to the former johnson bank illinois offices in winnetka and lake forest 
wealth management fee revenue grew to million in  compared to million in in february  the acquisition of johnson bank illinois added approximately million to trust assets under administration

increases in expenses for salaries and benefits  occupancy  professional services  data processing and insurance reflect the impact of growing our personnel  the opening of our new banking office in geneva  and broadening our array of products 
we also incurred charges of  during related to the completion of system related conversions 
during  the lake forest and the winnetka offices formerly known as johnson bank illinois contributed million to operating expenses  including  of goodwill expense 
non interest expense for the year ended december  includes operating expenses of million and million related to the st

additionally  results reflect the addition of the two new locations acquired through the johnson bank illinois transaction which increased operating expenses by million for the year ended december  in addition to the  of goodwill amortization recognized during in connection with the acquisition 
the remaining increase in non interest expense during of approximately million is due to overall growth in salaries and benefits  professional services and marketing costs at our existing offices 
included in total non interest expense for the year ended december   is the one time million charge associated with the acquisition of towne square financial corporation  as well as  of transaction costs associated with the acquisition 
the million non recurring charge is not tax deductible

louis start up costs totaling non interest expense less non interest income divided by average total assets 
non interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  plus non interest income 
our efficiency ratio tax equivalent  which measures the percentage of net revenue that is expended as non interest expense for the year ended december  improved slightly as compared to the efficiency ratio for the year ended december  adjusted to exclude one time charges 
excluding the effects of one time charges during and  our efficiency ratio increased to in from in the slight improvement in our efficiency ratio during as compared to demonstrates that our business development efforts at the new offices are generating revenue sufficient to offset the related operating expenses in addition to reflecting the impact of securities net gains in the privatebank st 
louis became profitable during the fourth quarter of our newest location in geneva is not yet profitable  but the location has exceeded its growth targets for loans and deposits during our efficiency ratio for was negatively impacted due to the start up nature of the st 
charles office and the st 
louis office 
our st 
charles office first broke even on a monthly basis in july  approximately within one year of the acquisition date 
during  the costs of business development at the geneva office are expected to exceed the related operating expenses

salary and employee benefit expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  full time equivalent employees increased to at december  from at december  the increase in salary and benefits is due primarily to the full effect of the johnson bank illinois acquisition  the opening and staffing of the privatebank st

the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by all available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified

we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
loans in this category include those with characteristics such as past due more than days  those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends  or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections  renegotiations and renewals 
the principal amount of loans in this category as of december  was  loans past due days or more increased by million as of december  as compared to december  levels

these amounts are not deposits and are not insured  but are secured by a pool of securities pledged specifically for this purpose 
membership in the federal home loan bank system gives us the ability to borrow funds from the federal home loan bank of chicago and from the federal home loan bank of des moines for short or long term purposes under a variety of programs 
we have periodically used services of the fhlb for short term funding needs and other correspondent services 
during  we increased our utilization of federal home loan bank advances to fund loan growth 
management anticipates that our reliance on federal home loan bank borrowings as a funding source will likely remain at current levels in to the extent that rates on federal home loan bank advances continue to be more attractive than deposit pricing 
federal home loan bank borrowings totaled million at december  compared to million at december  at december   we had million in fhlb letters of credit outstanding compared to million outstanding at december  we pay per annum for fhlb letters of credit 
the following table shows the maximum availability for and usage of fhlb advances and letters of credit for the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis 
maximum date availability usage in thousands as of december  the privatebank chicago   the privatebank st 
louis   as of december  the privatebank chicago   the privatebank st 
louis   we accept deposits from a variety of municipal entities 
typically  these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits 
the state of illinois also accepts fhlb letters of credit as collateral 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of securities collateralizing such public deposits 
deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits  and the assets that are pledged as collateral for these deposits are not deemed to be liquid assets 
on february   we entered into a new  two year  million revolving credit facility 
we borrowed million under the line in connection with the johnson bank illinois acquisition at an initial rate of 
during the second quarter  we increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility by approximately million in order to capitalize the privatebank st 
louis 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we increased our borrowings under the revolving credit facility by approximately million and  respectively  for business operating purposes 
the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving line resets quarterly  and is based on  at our option  either the lender s prime rate or a day libor based rate 
the interest rate on the revolving line reset to on december  upon issuing million of trust preferred securities on february   the company repaid the million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
in june  we increased the borrowings on the credit facility to  and in december  we increased borrowings by million for general business purposes 
as of december   the outstanding balance was million 
the company is currently renegotiating the terms of the revolving credit facility 
the original terms of the credit facility are still currently in effect 
we also issued a million subordinated note to johnson international  inc as partial payment of the purchase price of the johnson bank illinois acquisition 
the interest rate on the subordinated note resets each quarter based on the day libor rate 
the note is payable in full on or before february   and provides for certain rate escalation beginning after two years 
the initial rate of interest on the subordinated note was and reset to on february  on february   we issued million in trust preferred securities at a fixed rate of which mature on december  at our option  the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity on or after december  the trust preferred securities are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as long term debt trust preferred securities 
upon receipt of the net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses and including the underwriters over allotment shares  we repaid the full amount of borrowings under our revolving line of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of million 
risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
during  we began to hedge this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we use a combination of financial instruments  including medium term and short term financings and variable rate debt instruments and  to a lesser extent  interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related cash flows 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  in we entered into our first interest rate swap transaction in which we agreed to receive a fixed rate in exchange for payment of a floating rate based on an agreed upon notional amount 
the fair value of the swap was million on december  during  we actively managed our interest rate exposure in our balance sheet 
the declines in market rates gave us the opportunity to make changes to our investment security portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset liability management strategies 
throughout  we were able to replace specific investment securities with alternative investment securities with greater risk reward parameters 
in addition  we took advantage of callable brokered deposits which were redeemed and replaced with lower costing brokered deposits 
the improvements in net interest margin resulting from the improved mix of investment securities coupled with our lower yielding sources of funding offset the yield compression experienced in our loan portfolio  which is more than half floating rate based 
we have not changed our interest rate risk management strategy from the prior year and do not foresee or expect any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but we are considering expanding our use of interest rate swaps on our debt obligations in the near future 
capital resources stockholders equity at december  rose to million  an increase of million from the year end level of million  due primarily to the increase in net income from the year ended december  as well as the change in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale net of tax 
we are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors  and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas 
failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
if a banking subsidiary is not well capitalized  regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits 
if undercapitalized  capital distributions  asset growth and expansion are limited and plans for capital restoration are required 
the following table reflects various consolidated measures of our capital at december  and december  leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio total equity to total assets as of december   the entire amount of our million of trust preferred securities is included in tier capital 
the tier qualifying amount is limited to of tier capital under federal reserve regulations 
the entire amount of trust preferred securities qualifies as tier capital 
the subordinated note in the amount of million that was issued to johnson international as consideration in connection with the johnson bank illinois acquisition qualifies as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
to be considered well capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
to be adequately capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at december   we continued to exceed the minimum levels of all regulatory capital requirements  and were considered adequately capitalized under regulatory standards 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio was 
with the exception of the total risk based capital ratio  we exceeded the well capitalized levels of our regulatory capital requirements 
at december   the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis were considered well capitalized under all applicable regulatory standards  including the total risk based capital ratio 
liquidity liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for our clients credit needs 
our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities  investment in and maturity of assets  changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets 
liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost 
liquidity management is guided by policies  formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments 
our principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital contributions by privatebancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital 
our core deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits 
core deposits are defined to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds 
time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
over the past several years  our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short 
we expect these short term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place 
in the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank  unless those deposits are replaced with traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowed money or capital  we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs 
we have continued to use federal home loan bank advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding loan growth 
during  we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand and year contingency planning 
during we expanded our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of the privatebank chicago 
during we expect to continue to utilize brokered deposits together with increased federal home loan bank advances as alternative methods of funding loan growth 
we will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources  but plan to supplement our funding needs with non traditional funding sources as needed 
the privatebank st 
louis began to purchase brokered deposits in as well  in the absence of traditional deposit growth sufficient to fund the expected loan growth in that market 
liquid assets refer to money market assets such as federal funds sold  available for sale securities  fhlb stock  bank owned life insurance and loans held for sale 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and the federal reserve deposit requirements 
at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank chicago were million as compared to million at december  at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank st 
louis were million as compared to million at december  net cash inflows provided by operations were million for the year ended december  compared to a net inflow of million a year earlier 
net cash outflows from investing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to a net cash outflow of million a year earlier 
cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to a net inflow of million in in the event of short term liquidity needs  the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks 
in addition  we currently have available borrowing capacity of million under the million credit facility at the holding company 
we utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
we measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured the assets and liabilities of our company to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
our policy states that we shall maintain a gap position at the one year horizon of between and 
our position at december  was and was within the guidelines of our policy 
we have continued to maintain our gap position near the low end set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent 
therefore  generally speaking  a short term rise in interest rates will hurt our earnings  while a short term drop in interest rates would help our earnings 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors which are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement 
for example  a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage related investments to prepay more quickly than projected 
this could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped 
conversely  a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage related loans which would increase our returns

the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
december  december  basis basis basis basis points points points points percentage change in net interest income due to an immediate basis point change in interest rates over a one year time horizon this table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december  and december   we would suffer a decline in net interest income of and  respectively  over each one year period 
conversely  a shift of basis points would increase net interest income over a one year horizon based on december  balances  as compared to measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
changes in the effect on net interest income from a basis point movement at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
although we are negatively gapped within one year  the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet in the first days of the simulation  coupled with the timing of repricing within the to day bucket  leads to the increase in net interest income from a basis point move 
the difference in the effect on net interest income at december  as compared to december  is due to the differences in the timing  balances  and current rates versus simulated rates of repricing assets and liabilities 
management s likely reaction to changes in interest rates is incorporated in assumptions made in these calculations 
differences in these assumptions between the reporting periods have also had the effect of reducing the impact of a changing interest rate environment 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
