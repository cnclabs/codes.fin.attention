item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we used in applying the critical accounting policies 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely event that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory inventories  which are composed of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a periodic basis  the company analyzes the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  we would record a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance in the period in which we made such a determination 
goodwill impairment the company evaluates the valuation of its goodwill according to the provisions of sfas to determine if the current value of goodwill has been impaired 
to do this the company determines the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows based on anticipated results of operations for the coming years 
if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations  goodwill could become impaired which would result in a charge to earnings 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance would be set up should the realization of any deferred taxes become less likely than not to occur 
the valuation allowance is analyzed periodically by the company and may result in income tax expense different than statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in item  the company completed the asset sale of bowman tool machining  inc on february  as a result of this transaction  the company received approximately million in cash  along with the buyer assuming another million in long term debt and capital leases 
the company used  of the cash received to payoff its term note facility with its bank 
the company also used approximately  of its cash received to pay accounts payable and accrued liabilities retained as part of the sale 
the company s net working capital at the end of fiscal was  as compared to a negative  at the end of fiscal the improvement was due in large measure to the sale of bowman tool assets described above 
net working capital also improved due to the recognition of deferred tax assets as more fully described in note of the financial statements  and the corresponding inclusion of  of deferred taxes in current assets 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities improved to to from 
to in the prior year 
the company s cash provided from operations was a negative  but included in that total were bowman accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  that were retained as part of the asset sale 
excluding those payments  the company would have generated  of cash from operations in fiscal cash provided from operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal additions to property  plant and equipment were  in fiscal compared to  in and  in these amounts included   and  of machinery acquired through capital leases in  and  respectively 
the major capital expenditures consisted of the acquisition of new production equipment 
proceeds from the sale of equipment amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the relatively large proceeds in resulted from the sale of excess equipment derived from the shutdown of the company s long lake  minnesota facility 
in fiscal  the company sold its building in long lake for million 
the company s total debt was million at august  and consisted of million of seller subordinated notes and capital lease obligations of million 
the total debt was million lower than fiscal current maturities of long term debt consist of  due february to a subordinated debt holder and  due on capital leases 
the company is presently seeking a new lending arrangement with a new bank to provide a revolving credit facility 
however  should the company not obtain a new credit arrangement  it is managements belief that internally generated funds will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its financial requirements during fiscal results of operations net sales in fiscal were million 
that is a decrease of million or from fiscal the primary reason for this was the asset sale of bowman tool in february  and thus the inclusion of only a half year of bowman sales in operations 
year on year sales for taurus numeric tool the remaining subsidiary of wsi increased in fiscal to approximately million from million in this increase in sales resulted from the addition of a new product line in the recreational vehicle market offset by the decline in sales from the aerospace and avionics market due to the events of september  net sales in fiscal of million decreased million or from fiscal sales of million 
sales decreased in as compared to for three primary reasons 
the first was the overall downturn in the economy that affected all markets served by the company 
secondly  as mentioned in previous quarterly reports on form q  a major customer made the decision to effectively consign raw materials for its manufacturing programs to the company instead of wsi purchasing the material and subsequently reselling the material after manufacture 
this consignment arrangement resulted in lower sales to that customer 
the last reason for the decreased in sales was the loss of a larger customer at the end of the second quarter of fiscal the company reported a net loss in fiscal of  or 
per share 
included in the results were recognition of the loss on the sale of bowman assets of million and an income tax benefit of approximately million 
excluding these two items  the company incurred a loss from operations of in fiscal  the company reported a net loss of million or 
per share compared to net earnings of  or 
per share in and  or 
per share in the net earnings in fiscal included a gain from the termination of the company s defined pension plan of  a gain on the sale of excess equipment of  and  in severance costs paid to employees affected by the long lake plant shutdown 
the gross margin on parts sold in fiscal was of sales compared to in and in the margin decreased in large measure due to volume inefficiencies related to the softness of the aerospace avionics markets and  correspondingly  due to the non aerospace avionics business consisting of higher material content products 
the margins were also affected by a  increase in the company s inventory obsolescence reserve made in the second quarter due to the softening of the aerospace avionics business 
year to date margins for the taurus operation were and for and  respectively  and were affected by the items in the preceding discussion 
the gross margin on parts sold in fiscal was of sales compared to of sales in margin improved in versus despite the lower level of sales 
the primary reason for this was the increased efficiencies obtained due to the closure of the company s long lake  minnesota facility which was open only part of the year in fiscal gross margin was hampered as the year went on and the level of sales softened gross margin in the first quarter was versus in the fourth quarter 
selling and administrative expense of million in fiscal was a decrease of million and million from fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in was due to several factors 
first  the sale of the bowman subsidiary assets generated a savings of approximately  in the last six months of the company s selling and administrative expense was also lower in due the company s adoption of fas goodwill and intangible assets as outlined in note of the financial statements which resulted in a reduction of amortization expense of  a third factor in the reduced expense related to the june sale of the company s long lake  minnesota facility 
the company had included in selling and administrative expense in fiscal carrying costs of the building of  while the amount in fiscal was approximately  wsi s selling and administrative costs were also lower in due to cost containment measures including reductions in wages and benefits  professional services and cost savings due to the consolidation efforts that were a result of the sale of the bowman tool subsidiary assets 
the slight decrease in selling and administrative expense in versus was a combination of lower incentive compensation and profit sharing partially offset by the carrying cost of the long lake building being included in selling and administrative expense for a longer period in versus interest and other expense of  in fiscal was  lower than and  lower than the lower expense is a result of lower long term debt as balances decreased from million in including current maturities to million at the end of in  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted for companies with fiscal years beginning after march  the company adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal effective with the august  adoption of fas  goodwill is no longer amortized but is instead subject to an annual impairment test 
the company has performed its transitional impairment test in conjunction with the adoption of fas and determined that no charge is warranted 
the company s primary method of estimating goodwill impairment consisted of a discounted cash flow analysis based on the company s best estimate of future operations  taking into account variations that might occur with different levels of business 
the company recognized an income tax benefit of million in fiscal prior to  the company recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was eliminated in based on the operating results from the fourth quarter and projections for upcoming years that  in the company s estimation  would make it more likely than not that it will fully utilize its prior loss carryforwards and tax credits 
subsequent to fiscal  it is anticipated that the company will record income tax expense in line with statutory rates
