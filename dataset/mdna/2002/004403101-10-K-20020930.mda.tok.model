the company s policy is to charge off its participation interests in all bank loans which are days or more past due or delinquent 
charge offs are applied as a reduction to the loan loss provision  and any recoveries of previously charged off participation interests in bank loans are applied as an increase to the loan loss provision 
management determines or calculates the loan loss provision for the company s participation interests in outstanding bank loans as a percentage of its participation interests in the total principal amount of and accrued interest on the bank loans that are to mature  or become due and payable  in a particular time period typically  a fiscal quarter 
though the company s desire is to receive or collect of the participation interests in the sum of the principal amount of and accrued interest on all matured bank loans  the company has established the loan loss provision on the assumption that it will receive in payment of its participation interests an amount equal to for bank loans due or past due in the company s first  second  and fourth fiscal quarters or for bank loans due or past due in the company s third fiscal quarter of its participation interests in the sum of the principal amount of and accrued interest on all matured bank loans or  in other words  in the company s first  second or fourth fiscal quarters  and in the company s third fiscal quarter  of its participation interests in all of the bank loans will be charged off

receive or collect a cumulative or in the company s third fiscal quarter by days out ie  by june for the same quarterly portfolio

critical estimates  uncertainties or assessments in the financial statements the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying the accounting principles  management must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
as might be expected  the actual results or outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts 
these differences are usually minor and are included in the company s consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known 
estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
actual results related to the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements will emerge over periods of time  such as estimates and assumptions underlying the determination of allowance for loan losses and self insurance liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  the company s liability for self insurance related to workers compensation  general liability  and medical liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these estimates and assumptions because of the period over which actual results may emerge  such risk is mitigated by the ability to make changes to these estimates and assumptions over the same period 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
one of the methods used for this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets exceeds its fair value 
the company believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable 
changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value  however  could affect the evaluation 
based on an assessment of the company s accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a 
table of contents meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
the company does not suggest that other risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in growth objectives  could not adversely impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from the company s estimates 
the company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of its allowance for loan losses 
the next paragraph addresses the company s accounting policy concerning such allowance 
other accounting policies are disclosed in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level it considers sufficient to cover anticipated losses in the collection of its loan receivables 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based upon a review of historical and recent loan losses and the loan portfolio  and takes into consideration economic conditions and trends 
the allowance for loan losses is periodically reviewed by the company s management with any changes reflected in current operations 
it is at least reasonably possible that actual loan losses may be materially different from the recorded allowance for loan losses 
operating trends seasonality the company s business is seasonal to the extent of the impact of cashing tax refund checks 
the impact of these services is in the third and fourth quarters of the company s fiscal year 
impact of inflation management believes that the company s results of operations are not dependent upon the levels of inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  particularly including changes in interest rates that might affect the costs of its financing under the credit agreement 
to mitigate the risks of changes in interest rates  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
to reduce its risk of greater interest expense because of interest rate fluctuations  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements  which effectively converted a portion of its floating rate interest obligations to fixed rate interest obligations  as described in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the company s existing interest rate swap was million as of june  based on the average outstanding indebtedness in the previous quarter  a change in interest rates would have changed the company s interest expense by approximately  pre tax for the year ended june  without consideration of the company s interest rate swap 
the associated underlying debt has exceeded the notional amount for each swap throughout the existence of the swap and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so 
the remaining swap is based on the same index as  and repriced on a consistent basis with  its respective underlying debt
