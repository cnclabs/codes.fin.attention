item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans  information included or incorporated by reference in our future filings with the securities and exchange commission including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans and information contained in written material  releases and oral statements issued by us  or on our behalf  including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the following reliance on single product line and significant distributor 
our accelerated reader software and supplemental accelerated reader quizzes accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in   and  respectively 
sales of our products through one book distributor accounted for   and of net sales in   and  respectively 
an overall decline in sales of accelerated reader and supplemental quizzes  including sales through book distributors  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on continued product development 
the k educational technology and professional development markets in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards  frequent product introductions  and sudden technological change 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on a number of factors  including our ability to enhance our existing products and develop and successfully introduce new products  including new products designed for use in other areas of the curriculum  our ability to ship new products in a timely fashion and our ability to respond quickly and in a cost efficient manner to technological change  including shifts in operating systems  languages  alternative delivery systems and other environments 
there can be no assurance that new products will be as well received as our established products  particularly since such other products may require technology and or resources not generally available in all schools 
we attempt to maintain high standards for the demonstrated academic effectiveness of our products 
our adherence to these standards could delay or inhibit the introduction of new products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our products will not be rendered obsolete or that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments or be able to develop and market the products required to maintain our competitive position 
management of growth 
we have experienced rapid growth 
if such growth continues  it may place a strain on our financial  management  systems  and other resources 
our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to attract  train  motivate  manage  and retain key employees and to improve our operational  financial  and management information systems 
if we were unable to maintain and manage growth effectively  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
risks of new products and services for new markets 
our business strategy includes the introduction of new products and services directed at new markets 
through our generation learning systems subsidiary  we sell enterprise software for training development and management primarily to businesses and government organizations 
we have historically focused on the education market and have little  if any  experience in developing and marketing products and services to business or government customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in offering new products and services and entering new markets as planned or that any such products or services  if introduced  will achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
risks of international expansion 
a key component of our growth strategy is to continue to expand our operations into international markets 
doing business in international markets is subject to a number of risks  including  among others acceptance by foreign educational systems of our approach to educational products  lack of existing customer base  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changing economic conditions  exposure to different legal standards particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
opposing educational philosophies 
we focus on developing and marketing educational products and services that demonstrate effectiveness through measurable results 
this approach  however  is not accepted by all academics and educators  some of whom formulate opinions about the desirability of a particular educational product or service based on philosophical or other concerns rather than the effectiveness of the product 
certain academics and educators are opposed to the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with our products  such as the use of objective standards  standardized testing  computers and motivational techniques  among others 
some of these philosophical opponents of our products and services have the capacity to influence the market for our products  and such influence could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and  thus  our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on educational institutions and government funding 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales to educational institutions  individual educators  and suppliers thereto 
there can be no assurance that educational institutions and or individual educators will continue to invest in technology based products and professional development for reading and other curricula or continue to respond favorably to our marketing 
our inability to increase the number of products sold or number of schools served would adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
because of our dependence on educational institutions  the funding of which is largely dependent on government support  a substantial decrease in government budgets or funding for educational software or technology would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any economic slow down which would negatively affect school funding could adversely impact the sale of our products to schools 
in addition  certain aspects of government sponsored education initiatives may not endorse  or be complementary to  the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with our products  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
geographic concentration of sales 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in several states  including california  texas  florida  georgia  and north carolina  which accounted for approximately million  million  million  million  and million  respectively  of our net sales in if large numbers of schools or a district or districts controlling a large number of schools in such states were to discontinue purchasing our products  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
highly competitive industry 
the k educational technology and professional development markets in which we operate are very competitive 
we compete primarily against more traditional methods of education  training and testing  including pencil and paper testing 
in addition  we compete with other companies offering educational software products to schools 
our reading products also compete more directly with products such as scholastic s reading counts 
many other companies provide educational software products which we believe are not marketed primarily to schools 
our existing competitors may continue to broaden their product lines  and potential competitors  including large hardware manufacturers  software developers and educational publishers  may enter or increase their focus on the school market  resulting in greater competition for us 
success in selling our products  particularly our reading products  may cause competitors to focus on our products in their marketing efforts thereby increasing direct competition 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to market our products successfully or compete effectively in the educational product marketplace 
dependence on key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued active participation of certain key members of management  including our co chairmen  judith paul and terrance paul 
ms 
paul acts as our spokesperson and coordinates our public relations and customer communications policies 
mr 
paul is primarily responsible for our long term strategic planning and new product development strategy 
we do not have employment agreements with either of these persons and have no current intention of entering into any such employment agreements 
the loss of services of either of these persons would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our continuing ability to retain the employees  including senior management personnel  who have assisted in the development and marketing of our products and to attract and retain qualified additional employees trained in computer technology  marketing  finance  and other disciplines to enhance our product offerings and broaden our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain the necessary personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly performance 
we generally ship products as orders are received  and therefore  we have historically operated without a significant backlog of products 
thus  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on the quantity of product orders received in that quarter 
the quantity of product orders in any quarter can be affected by a variety of factors  including the following delays in the development and or shipment of new products can adversely affect our revenue in one or more quarters  the shipment of new products for which orders have been building for some period of time can cause the revenues in the quarter in which shipment occurs to be higher than revenues in preceding or subsequent quarters  and seasonal variations due to  among other things  the budget and school year cycles of our school customers 
in addition to fluctuations in product orders  our quarterly results can also be affected by the following charges related to acquisitions  including acquisition expenses  the write off of in process research and development  the amortization of goodwill  and similar items  charges related to obsolete or impaired assets  and expenses related to product development and marketing initiatives 
our overall gross margins also fluctuate based upon the mix of product sales and service sales 
we realize significantly higher margins on our product sales 
service revenues tend to be more seasonal than product revenues  resulting in seasonal variations in margins 
quarterly service revenues are typically highest in the third quarter 
share price volatility 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include announcements of technological innovations and or new products by us and our competitors  earnings releases and earnings warnings by us and our competitors  expectations regarding government funding levels for education  market conditions in the industry  and the general state of the securities markets 
the market price of our common stock may decline significantly if we fail to meet the published earnings estimates of analysts and others 
in addition  quarterly fluctuations of our results of operations as described above may cause a significant variation in the market price of our common stock 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard certain of our technologies as proprietary and rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee non disclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our rights will be adequate to prevent or deter misappropriation 
in addition  while we do not believe that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that a third party will not make a contrary assertion 
the cost of responding to such an assertion may be material  whether or not the assertion is validated 
the software market has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of intellectual property rights 
such activity is difficult to detect and legal proceedings to enforce intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and costs 
there can be no assurance that our software products will not experience unauthorized reproduction  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
war  acts of war and terrorism 
delays and reductions in purchases of our products may occur as a result of war  acts of war and terrorism  and the related impacts  including a reduction of funds available to our customers to purchase our products and services and disruptions in our ability to develop  produce and distribute products and services to our customers 
these events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of share ownership  control by principal shareholders management 
as of february   our principal shareholders  judith and terrance paul  our co chairmen  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these principal shareholders have the ability to control and direct our business and affairs 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for the common stock 
as of february   approximately million shares of our common stock were held by affiliates and may be publicly sold only if registered under the securities act of or sold in accordance with an applicable exemption from registration  such as rule in addition  we have filed registration statements under the securities act of to register an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plan and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan  which will  when issued in accordance with such plans  be eligible for immediate sale in the public market  subject to the rule resale limitations for affiliates 
our principal shareholders  judith and terrance paul  have adopted a securities trading plan with respect to a portion of their renaissance learning  inc common stock 
the plan provides for the sale of approximately of the paul s current holdings of common stock on an annual basis 
the plan provides for monthly sales  subject to various legal and contractual limitations 
no payment of cash dividends 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
possible antitakeover effects of certain articles and by law provisions and provisions of wisconsin law 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  along with wisconsin statutory law  contain provisions that could discourage potential acquisition proposals and might delay or prevent a change in control of renaissance learning  inc such provisions could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and could result in the shareholders receiving less for their common stock than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt

we own of athena and we lease  square feet of the facility from athena 
additionally  we lease various other office space to accommodate subsidiary operations 
item legal proceedings we are subject to various claims and proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we believe that any liability that may ultimately arise from the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview renaissance learning  inc is a leading provider of comprehensive school improvement to kindergarten through senior high k schools in the united states and canada 
our software products  teacher training  and consulting help educators motivate students  accelerate learning  improve test scores  and help students master standards 
the computer based learning information systems and related training we offer are designed to improve student academic performance by increasing the quality  quantity  and timeliness of performance data available to educators and by facilitating increased student practice of essential skills 
our flagship product  accelerated reader  is software for motivating and monitoring increased literature based reading practice 
our software products also include star reading  a computer adaptive reading test and database  accelerated math and star math  software products that apply to math the principles that have made the reading software effective in improving academic performance  star early literacy computer adaptive diagnostic test for phonemic awareness and other emergent reading skills  perfect copy writing skills development software  and surpass test preparation software 
in we introduced and shipped ar universal  a new version of our accelerated reader reading management program which supports new recorded voice versions of quizzes on literature books for emergent readers and new quizzes for assessing reading instruction assignments such as those found in reading textbooks  magazines and other curricula 
star early literacy was released late in the second quarter of in late and early  we announced several new products which we expect to be released during fluent reader repeated reading software for struggling readers  standardsmaster instant assessment and web based reporting software  accelerated writer writing improvement system  accelerated vocabulary vocabulary development software  and acceltest test creation  scoring and gradebook software 
in addition  we provide electronic assessment software and services to educational publishers  enterprise software for training and knowledge management throughout organizations  and an optical mark card scanner which was totally reengineered in for lower cost and improved performance 
our comprehensive school improvement products also include reading renaissance  math renaissance and other programs through which we provide professional development training for educators 
our school renaissance program is a comprehensive package of software  professional development training  and consulting services aimed at accelerating learning and improving test scores in reading  math  writing  and overall academic performance throughout schools and school districts 
in  we introduced the seminar  using star early literacy and renaissance in your pre k classroom  that shows teachers how to use the new star early literacy program 
early in  we announced that writing renaissance is expected to be available sometime later in our sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products  software support agreements  and training seminars and programs 
revenues are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
allowances for bad debts are also recorded at the time of the sale 
product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from sales of our off the shelf software products at the time of shipment to customers 
we recognize revenue from the sale of custom software products on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
service revenue is derived from i training seminars  ii consulting services  and iii software support agreements whereby we provide ongoing customer support as well as unspecified product upgrades if and when available 
revenue from training seminars is recognized when the seminar is performed 
revenue from consulting services is recognized as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period 
telephone support included with software sales has a duration of twelve months or less and is recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same time 
revenue from separately sold software support agreements is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over or months depending on the term of the support agreement 
deferred revenue includes i payments received for products not yet delivered  ii advance payments on contract revenues  iii payments received for seminars not yet held  and iv that portion of separately sold software support agreements that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
because software products are generally shipped as orders are received  we have historically operated without a significant backlog of products 
however  it is our practice to announce new products prior to the time at which such products will be ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in a significant backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
registrations for training seminars are generally received from customers in advance of training events  resulting in a backlog for these services 
additionally  under district wide school improvement agreements  customers commit to a comprehensive package of software  training  and consulting in advance of delivery of the products and services 
the delivery of backlogged products and services in certain periods can cause those periods to have somewhat higher sales and higher sales growth rates than other periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of software products  support agreements  and training seminars and programs 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs of purchased materials such as optical mark card scanners  educational products  training materials  manuals and motivational items  iii shipping and freight costs  iv amortization of capitalized development costs  and v other overhead costs 
we recognize significantly higher gross margins on our product sales than on our service sales 
an optical mark card scanner is included with the sale of all accelerated math site licenses and many additional scanners are sold separately 
the gross profit margin on hardware is not as high as the gross profit margin on software 
we began shipping hardware in and as sales of hardware increased the overall product margin percentage declined in and we expense all development costs associated with a software product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales generally using the straight line method over months 
in november  our subsidiary  renaissance corporate services  inc  acquired the assets and business of engineering software associates  inc esa  minneapolis  minnesota  a provider of test generation and tutorial software to college textbook publishers 
post secondary textbook publishers have commissioned esa software to support textbooks on a wide variety of subjects 
instructors using the texts can administer tests to students on paper  via networks or over the internet 
the acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our overall results of operations in the near term 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data as a percentage of net sales  except that individual components of cost of sales and gross profit are shown as a percentage of their corresponding component of net sales for the years ended december  net sales products services total net sales cost of sales products services total cost of sales gross profit products services total gross profit operating expenses product development selling and marketing general and administrative purchased research and development operating income other income  net income before taxes income tax provision net income years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in product sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in product sales is primarily attributable to i increased sales of math products  including follow on sales of subject libraries and optical mark card scanners  ii increased sales of accelerated reader quizzes  with over  available book titles  to a larger base of accelerated reader schools  and iii sales of star early literacy  which was released late in the second quarter of service revenue  which consists primarily of revenue from sales of training sessions and software support agreements  increased by million  or  to million in from million in the majority of this increase is attributable to a increase in revenue recognized software support agreements 
revenues from training sessions grew slightly over approximately  educators attended our renaissance training programs in we expect overall revenue growth to be similar to revenue growth is anticipated to be higher in the second half of the year than the first due to the availability of increased federal funds to schools and the expected shipment of our new products in spring and summer 
our new products include fluent reader repeated reading software for struggling readers  standardsmaster instant assessment and web based reporting software  accelerated writer writing improvement system  accelerated vocabulary vocabulary development software  and acceltest test creation  scoring and gradebook software 
a fourth quarter math software promotion contributed to a quarterly increase of about  schools using math products  bringing the total number of schools using our math products to about  we expect continued growth in follow on sales of libraries  scanners  math learning cards and training 
we also expect continued steady growth of our reading products and continued expansion of our district wide school improvement business 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products remained constant at 
late in we completed the reengineering of our accelscan optical mark card scanner for lower cost and improved performance 
the lower cost has enabled us to lower the list price by in january and still achieve improved margins on the new scanner sales 
the cost of sales of services decreased by  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services decreased to in from in the improvement was due to stronger sales in the software support business and improved cost efficiencies in both the training and software support businesses 
service gross profit margin is expected to be somewhat lower in first quarter due to the national school renaissance conference  as has been the previous pattern 
on an annual basis in  we anticipate a moderate improvement in service gross profit margins over our overall gross profit margin increased to in from in due to improved gross profit margins on services and to a higher proportion of products in the sales mix during product development 
product development expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in these expenses increased primarily due to increased staff and consulting costs associated with new product development including several new products announced in late and early fluent reader  standardsmaster  accelerated writer  accelerated vocabulary  and acceltest  which are scheduled to be available for shipment in increased product development expenses are also attributed to our new accelscan optical mark card scanner which was totally reengineered in  continued development of a suite of web based versions of our existing core products  and new products at various stages of development which we expect to announce in the future 
we anticipate that the growth of product development costs will moderate in as a percentage of net sales  product development costs decreased to in from in selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in these expenses increased primarily due to i direct mailings to an increased customer and prospect base  ii increased wages and related benefit costs associated with hiring additional personnel to market and promote a broader product line  iii costs related to selling and marketing our district wide school improvement program  and iv costs of marketing the generation enterprise wide training and knowledge management software 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses remained constant at 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will generally continue to rise as we aggressively market our existing products and promote our new products in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the higher expenses for are largely due to increased wages and related benefit costs associated with the hiring of additional personnel  and professional fees  to support a larger base of business including generation and the acquisition of esa which was completed in november of as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative costs decreased to in from in we expect that general and administrative costs will increase to support our growth  but will decrease somewhat as a percentage of net sales in operating income 
operating income increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income increased to in from in income taxes 
income tax expense of million was recorded in at an effective income tax rate of compared to million and effective income tax rate in we expect to maintain our effective tax rate at or below in years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in product sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in product sales is primarily attributable to i increased sales of math products  including follow on sales of subject libraries and optical mark card scanners and ii increased sales of accelerated reader quizzes to a larger base of accelerated reader schools 
service revenue  which consists of revenue from sales of training sessions and software support agreements  increased by million  or  to million in from million in approximately million of this increase is attributable to our first annual national school renaissance conference presented in february and the balance of the increase is primarily due to increased revenue from renaissance training sessions 
we trained over  educators in our renaissance training programs in revenue growth rates slowed in due in part to the late fall shipment of our new version of accelerated reader 
we missed the prime fall buying season for schools  which slowed follow on purchases of accelerated reader quizzes as well as adoptions by new schools in late and early sales of follow on quizzes improved in late as schools had installed the new accelerated reader software and returned to their normal buying patterns 
sales of accelerated math increased significantly in with a growing customer base adopting accelerated math for their school  and existing customers purchasing additional subject libraries and scanners to expand utilization throughout their schools 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products increased to in compared to in primarily due to increased sales of optical mark card scanners 
a scanner is included with the sale of all accelerated math site licenses and many additional scanners are sold separately 
the gross profit margin on hardware is not as high as the gross profit margin on software 
the cost of sales of services increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily the result of costs associated with i our first annual national school renaissance conference presented in early  ii increased technical support costs due to a broader product line and the introduction of new versions of existing products and iii increased costs of delivering training sessions 
as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services increased to in from in due to the higher costs of providing technical support for our broader product line and new versions of existing products 
our overall gross profit margin decreased to in from in due to decreased gross profit margins on both products and services 
product development 
product development expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in these expenses increased primarily due to increased staff and consulting costs associated with new product development including several new products announced in eschooloffice web based school administration software  new versions of generation s total knowledge management enterprise training software  and star early literacy diagnostic assessment for grades k increased product development expenses are also attributed to the development of localized versions of our products for international markets  the completion of new accelerated reader quizzes  surpass test preparation software released for sale in texas in late  creation of additional surpass test preparation libraries  continued development of a suite of web based versions of our existing core products  and a number of new products at various stages of development 
as a percentage of net sales  product development costs increased to in from in selling and marketing
