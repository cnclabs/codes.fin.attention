item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the research  development and commercialization of products for the non invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease 
using innovative technologies  we are addressing such key problems in cardiac diagnosis as the identification of those at risk of sudden cardiac arrest 
our proprietary technology and products are the only diagnostic tool cleared by the us food and drug administration to non invasively measure microvolt levels of t wave alternans  an extremely subtle beat to beat fluctuation in a patient s heartbeat 
during we completed the transition of our primary focus from research and development of our proprietary microvolt t wave alternans technology to sales and marketing of our products 
our efforts are targeted on penetration of a new market with our heartwave and micro v alternans sensors products distributed through our direct sales organization in the united states 
at the end of  of our employees were engaged in field sales  clinical support and the marketing of our microvolt t wave alternans technology 
our ch stress test system is now distributed exclusively in the us and on a non exclusive basis outside the us  by philips 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are recognized upon shipment of goods provided that risk of loss has passed to the customer  all of our obligations have been fulfilled  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from maintenance contracts and licenses agreements is recorded over the term of the underlying agreement 
payments received in advance of services being performed is recorded as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory obsolescence we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized  minor replacements  maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations 
depreciation is computed by applying the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the life of the related lease 
we perform reviews for the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets intangible assets primarily relate to the value of capitalized software 
the cost of capitalized software is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated lives of up to three years 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue was  during fiscal  and  during fiscal  an increase of 
the increase during fiscal was primarily due to a increase in revenue from the sale of our alternans products  primarily heartwave and micro v alternans sensors 
in addition  revenue from the sale of our ch stress test system increased by over fiscal as a result of increased orders from our european distributors and sales to our exclusive us distributor  philips  during us revenue was  during fiscal and  during fiscal  an increase of 
revenue from our core business us sales of heartwave and micro v alternans sensors during fiscal increased compared to fiscal sales of our microvolt t wave alternans equipment increased  while sales of our micro v alternans sensors increased during fiscal us revenue from the sale of our ch stress test system increased in fiscal compared to fiscal these standard stress products are sold exclusively in the us by philips 
international revenue was  during fiscal and  during fiscal  an increase of 
revenue from the sale of standard stress test systems increased in fiscal this is primarily the result of an increase in orders from our european distributor in the united kingdom that were funded by government resources designated specifically for the upgrade of cardiology equipment in public hospitals 
revenue from the sale of microvolt t wave alternans systems declined during fiscal  primarily as a result of a change in emphasis from the higher priced ch system to the more flexible  lower priced heartwave system 
gross profit was of total revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal the improvement in the margin percentage to sales reflects the favorable effect of higher sales of our more profitable heartwave and micro v alternans sensors by lowering the amount of labor and overhead costs required to manufacture each unit 
additionally  the supplier cost reductions had a favorable effect on overall gross margins 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
costs incurred during the first half of reflected the development efforts associated with our heartwave stress and ep systems 
both versions of the product were introduced to the market during the second half of research and development costs during were primarily in support of key clinical studies and selected development programs  including the development of a new microsoft windows operating system for our ch stress test system distributed exclusively in the us by philips 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
we incurred increased costs associated with the recruitment and hiring of additional direct sales representatives during fiscal we anticipate that our costs during fiscal will increase  as we expect to continue the expansion of our us sales organization in additional major metropolitan areas 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
this decrease resulted from a lower level of invested cash during fiscal as compared to fiscal and the decline in both short and long term interest rates during the last twelve month period 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues were  during fiscal and  during the twelve month period ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease during fiscal was led by a decline in sales during the first nine months of compared to the same period in this was the result of our decision to focus all of our sales efforts on our alternans technology and away from the standard stress test market  which had accounted for a major portion of our revenue in fiscal however  revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal increased over the average of the three previous quarters of fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the introduction of our new heartwave system during the third quarter of fiscal us revenue was  during fiscal and  during fiscal  an increase of 
revenue from the sale of all microvolt t wave alternans products ch  heartwave  micro v alternans sensors during fiscal increased compared to fiscal sales of microvolt t wave alternans equipment  both our ch and heartwave products  increased  while sales of micro v alternans sensors increased during fiscal revenue from the sale of standard stress test systems declined in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting the change in our focus away from the standard stress market 
international revenue was  during fiscal  and  during fiscal  a decrease of 
revenue from the sale of equipment declined in fiscal this was primarily the result of our japanese distributors efforts to reduce its inventory levels of ch in advance of the introduction of the heartwave to japan  in the second half of revenue from the sale of micro v alternans sensors to international distributors in fiscal increased over fiscal our revenue recognition method for license fees has been to recognize income ratably over the term of the license 
license fee revenue for fiscal and fiscal was  each year 
gross profit was of total revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease was the result of higher costs incurred on initial heartwave units shipped during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
costs associated with the design and development of our new heartwave products accounted for a major portion of the costs incurred during fiscal these costs were partially offset by reduced costs associated with lower levels of clinical and regulatory activity during fiscal when compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the growth in fiscal expenditures include  costs incurred for the promotion of our new heartwave products  introduced late in fiscal  and expenses in support of our efforts to gain favorable reimbursement from third party insurers for healthcare providers for their performance of a microvolt t wave alternans tests 
in addition  we incurred costs associated with the recruitment and hiring of additional direct sales representatives in the second half of fiscal general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal as a result of costs incurred for the recruitment and hiring of key personnel 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase resulted from a higher level of invested cash resulting from the sale of  shares of our common stock in two private placements completed in january and september inflation and income taxes inflation did not have a significant effect on our results of operations for any of the years in the three year period ended december  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for the years    and because we incurred net losses in each of such years 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of  as well as  of federal and  of state tax credit carryforwards  available to offset future taxable income and income tax liabilities  respectively 
these carryforwards generally expire in the years through and may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in our ownership 
there can be no assurance that changes in ownership in future periods or continuing losses will not significantly limit our use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have generated taxable losses from operations since inception and  accordingly  have no taxable income available to offset the carryback of net operating losses 
in addition  although our operating plans anticipate taxable income in future periods  such plans provide for taxable losses over the near term and make significant assumptions which cannot be reasonably assured including market acceptance of our products by customers 
we have provided a full valuation allowance  at december  for our deferred tax assets since  in our opinion  realization of these future benefits is not sufficiently assured defined as a likelihood of slightly more than percent 
quarterly financial results the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for and in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by  from december  to december   consistent with our net loss for fiscal net of total financing activities 
accounts receivable  net  increased by  during the year  reflecting increase in sales in fiscal compared with fiscal inventory increased by  during the year  resulting from planned inventory builds to support our increase in sales volume  as well as  the postponement of fourth quarter shipments of philips ch stress systems 
fixed asset additions during the year primarily represent increased sales demonstration  clinical research units and additional information systems infrastructure 
the proceeds of our equity offerings have been used primarily to fund the accumulated deficit of  reflecting expenditures to support research  new product development and clinical trials activities  expansion of our sales organization  and to support an administrative infrastructure and the investment of approximately  in property and equipment through december  as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  under the terms of various license  consulting and technology agreements  we are required to pay royalties on sales of our products 
minimum license maintenance fees under these license agreements  which are creditable against royalties otherwise payable for each year  are  per year through we are committed to pay an aggregate of  of such minimum license maintenance fees subsequent to december  as part of these agreements  the company is also committed to meet certain development and sales milestones  including a requirement to spend a minimum of  in any two year period for research and development  clinical trials  marketing  sales and or manufacturing of products related to certain technology covered by the consulting and technology agreements 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months

factors which may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
risks related to our operations we have a history of net losses  we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability we are engaged primarily in the commercialization  manufacture  research and development of products for the non invasive diagnosis of heart disease 
we have incurred substantial and increasing net losses through december  we may never generate substantial revenues or achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in connection with the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
revenues generated from the sale of our products will depend upon numerous factors  including the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  varying pricing promotions and volume discounts to customers  competition  and the availability and amount of third party reimbursement 
we have not been able to fund our operations from cash generated by our business  and if we cannot meet our future capital requirements  we may not be able to develop or enhance our technology  take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures we have principally financed our operations over the past two years through the private placement of shares of our common stock 
if we do not generate sufficient cash from our business to fund operations  or if we cannot obtain additional capital through equity or debt financings  we will be unable to grow as planned and may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities  develop new technology or respond to competitive pressures 
this could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
any additional financing we may need in the future may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of cambridge heart by our stockholders would be reduced and the securities issued could have rights  preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our current stockholders 
we depend exclusively on third parties to support the commercialization of our products internationally 
we market our products internationally through independent distributors 
these distributors also distribute competing products under certain circumstances 
the loss of a significant international distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business if a new distributor  sales representative or other suitable sales organization could not be found on a timely basis in the relevant geographic market 
to the extent that we rely on sales in certain territories through distributors  any revenues we receive in those territories will depend upon the efforts of our distributors 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that a distributor will market our products successfully or that the terms of any future distribution arrangements will be acceptable to us 
we depend on our microvolt t wave alternans technology for a significant portion of our revenues and if it does not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues could decline we believe that our future success will depend  in large part  upon the successful commercialization and market acceptance of our microvolt t wave alternans technology 
market acceptance will depend upon our ability to demonstrate the diagnostic advantages and cost effectiveness of this technology 
the failure of our microvolt t wave alternans technology to achieve broad market acceptance  the failure of the market for our products to grow or to grow at the rate we anticipate  or a decline in the price of our products would reduce our revenues 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize or achieve market acceptance of our microvolt t wave alternans technology or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are superior to our technology 
the results of future clinical studies may not support the usefulness of our technology we have sponsored and are continuing to sponsor clinical studies relating to our microvolt t wave alternans technology and micro v alternans sensors to more firmly establish the predictive value of such technology 
although studies on high risk patients to date have indicated that the measurement of microvolt t wave alternans to predict the vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia is comparable to electrophysiology testing  we do not know whether the results of such studies  particularly studies involving patients who are not at high risk  will continue to be favorable 
any clinical studies or trials which fail to demonstrate that the measurement of microvolt t wave alternans is at least comparable in accuracy to alternative diagnostic tests  or which otherwise call into question the cost effectiveness  efficacy or safety of our technology  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty responding to changing technology the medical device market is characterized by rapidly advancing technology 
our future success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with advancing technology and competitive innovations 
however  we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products 
in addition  we can give no assurance that new products or alternative diagnostic techniques may be developed that will render our current or planned products obsolete or inferior 
rapid technological development by competitors may result in our products becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
we depend heavily on a third party  to support the commercialization of our ch stress test system 
we rely solely on a single third party to commercialize our ch stress test system in the united states 
third parties may not perform their obligations as expected 
the amount and timing of resources that third parties devote to commercializing our products may not be within our control 
the third parties on which we rely may not be able to recruit and retain skilled sales representatives 
furthermore  our interests may differ from those of third parties that commercialize our products 
disagreements that may arise with third parties could limit the commercialization of our products  or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming  distracting and expensive 
if any third party that supports the commercialization of our products breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to conduct its activities in a timely manner  such breach  termination or failure could limit the continued commercialization of our ch product  require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote unforeseen additional resources to the commercialization of this product  or result in the termination of the commercialization of this product  and the resulting disruption of our business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do competition from competitors medical devices that diagnose cardiac disease is intense and likely to increase 
our success will depend on our ability to develop products and apply our technology and our ability to establish and maintain a market for our products 
we compete with manufacturers of electrocardiogram stress tests  the conventional method of diagnosing ischemic heart disease  as well as with manufacturers of other invasive and non invasive tests  including ep testing  electrocardiograms  holter monitors  ultrasound tests and systems of measuring cardiac late potentials 
many of our competitors and prospective competitors have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  research and development experience and regulatory  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
many of these competitors offer broad  well established product lines and ancillary services not offered by cambridge heart 
some of our competitors have long term or preferential supply arrangements with physicians and hospitals which may act as a barrier to market entry 
we obtain critical components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products from a limited group of suppliers  and if our suppliers fail to meet our requirements  we may be unable to meet customer demand and our customer relationships would suffer we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers 
our dependence on a single supplier or limited group of smaller suppliers for critical components and subassemblies exposes us to several risks  including a potential for interruption  or inconsistency in the supply of components or subassemblies  leading to backorders and product shortages  a potential for inconsistent quality of components or subassemblies supplied  leading to reduced customer satisfaction or increased product costs  and inconsistent pricing 
disruption or termination of the supply of these components and subassemblies could cause delays in the shipment of our products  resulting in potential damage to our customer relations and reduced revenue 
from time to time in the past  we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving timely shipment of key components from our suppliers 
we can give no assurance that we would be able to identify and qualify additional suppliers of critical components and subassemblies in a timely manner 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more key components or subassemblies included in our products could seriously harm our results of operations 
risks related to the market for cardiac diagnostic equipment we could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices entails the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls 
although we maintain product liability insurance in the united states and in other countries in which we conduct business  including clinical trials and product marketing and sales  such coverage may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent commercialization of the ch and the heartwave systems  or cause a significant financial burden on cambridge heart  or both  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and ability to market the both systems as currently contemplated 
we may not be able to maintain adequate levels of third party reimbursement our revenues currently depend and will continue to depend  to a significant extent  on sales of our heartwave and ch systems and micro v alerwave sensors 
our ability to successfully commercialize these systems depends in part on maintaining adequate levels of third party reimbursement for use of these systems 
the amount of reimbursement in the united states that is available for clinical use of the microvolt t wave alternans test may vary 
in the united states  the cost of medical care is funded  in substantial part  by government insurance programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and private and corporate health insurance plans 
third party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device has not received appropriate fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payer  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
our ability to commercialize the heartwave and ch systems successfully will depend  in large part  on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of performing a microvolt t wave alternans test continue to be available from government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
we do not know whether the reimbursement level in the united states for the microvolt t wave alternans test will increase in the future or that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  the heartwave and ch systems 
the inadequacy of the reimbursement for microvolt t wave alternans tests using the heartwave and ch systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop patentable products  enforce our patents and obtain patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
however  the patent positions of medical device companies  including cambridge heart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we can give no assurance that patents will issue from any patent applications we own or license or that  if patents do issue  the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  any issued patents we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights granted under issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  and we can give no assurance that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology  or disclose such technology or that we can ultimately protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
others could claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights our commercial success will depend in part on our neither infringing patents issued to others nor breaching the licenses upon which our products might be based 
we have licensed significant technology and patents from third parties  including patents and technology relating to microvolt t wave alternans and cardiac electrical imaging licensed from the massachusetts institute of technology 
our licenses of patents and patent applications impose various commercialization  sublicensing  insurance  royalty and other obligations on our part 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  licenses could convert from being exclusive to nonexclusive in nature or could terminate 
we could become involved in litigation over intellectual property rights the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
litigation  which would likely result in substantial cost to us  may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
in particular  our competitors and other third parties hold issued patents and are assumed to hold pending patent applications  which may result in claims of infringement against us or other patent litigation 
we also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office  which could result in substantial cost  to determine the priority of inventions 
furthermore  we may have to participate at substantial cost in international trade commission proceedings to abate importation of products  which would compete unfairly with our products 
if we are not able to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us we rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology 
we can give no assurance that others will not independently develop or acquire substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or disclose such technology or that we can ultimately protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
we rely on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  advisors  vendors and consultants 
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements 
failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations  including research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds and us government and other investment grade debt securities 
these investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help assure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe our portfolio has a material exposure due to market risk 
see note financial statements for a description of our other financial instruments 
we carry the amounts reflected in the balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  trade payables  and line of credit at fair value at december  due to the short maturities of these instruments
