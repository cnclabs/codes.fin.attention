in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  the primary component of a gas generant used in automotive airbag safety systems  and halotron  a chemical used in fire extinguishing systems ranging from portable fire extinguishers to airport firefighting vehicles 
the perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron facilities are located on our property in southern utah and the chemicals produced and sold at these facilities collectively represent our specialty chemicals operating segment 
our other lines of business include the development of real estate in nevada and the production of environmental protection equipment  including waste water and seawater treatment systems 
significant accounting policies 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions and estimates are particularly important when determining our projected liabilities for pension benefits  useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets  and the recoverability of deferred tax assets and long lived assets  including intangible assets 
other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  costs that may be incurred in connection with environmental matters and the resolution of litigation and other contingencies 
actual results will inevitably differ to some extent from estimates on which our consolidated financial statements were prepared 
sales and operating revenues 
sales of our perchlorate chemical products  consisting almost entirely of ap sales  accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in general  demand for ap is driven by a relatively small number of dod and nasa contractors 
as a result  any one individual ap customer usually accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 
for example  alliant accounted for approximately  and of our revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an agreement with thiokol with respect to the supply of ap through the year the agreement  as amended  provides that during its term thiokol will make all of its ap purchases from us 
in addition to the ap purchased from us  thiokol may use ap inventoried by it in prior years 
the agreement also establishes a pricing matrix under which ap unit prices vary inversely with the quantity of a specific grade of ap sold by us to all of our customers 
ap unit prices in the matrix at all quantity levels escalate each year through fiscal and  in fiscal  are adjusted downward by approximately 
such downward adjustment will have the effect of reducing revenues on ap sold to thiokol by in fiscal after the adjustment  ap unit prices continue to escalate each year through fiscal in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an agreement with alliant to extend an existing agreement through the year the agreement establishes prices for any ap purchased by alliant from us during the term of the agreement as extended 
under this agreement  alliant agrees to use its efforts to cause our ap to be qualified on all new and current programs served by alliant s bacchus works 
during  alliant acquired thiokol 
we have agreed with alliant that the individual agreements in place prior to alliant s acquisition of thiokol remain in place 
all thiokol programs existing at the time of the alliant acquisition principally the space shuttle and minuteman will continue to be priced under the thiokol agreement 
all alliant programs principally the delta  pegasus and titan will be priced under the alliant agreement 
demand for ap declined throughout the s 
in  supply capacity was substantially in excess of demand levels and  in an attempt to rationalize the ap industry  we consummated the acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition in  our annual sales volumes for our top grade of ap were approximately million  million  million and million pounds during the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
based principally upon information we have received from our major customers  we estimate that annual ap demand will be between million and million pounds over the next five years 
however  demand for ap is program specific and dependent upon  among other things  governmental appropriations 
we have no ability to influence the demand for ap 
sodium azide sales accounted for approximately  and of sales during fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
autoliv  our principal sodium azide customer  accounted for approximately  and of our revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
worldwide sodium azide demand declined significantly during the last three fiscal years 
our sodium azide sales volumes declined approximately in both fiscal and  and declined further by approximately during fiscal worldwide demand for sodium azide is substantially less than worldwide supply 
based principally upon market information received from airbag inflator manufacturers  we expect sodium azide use to continue to decline and that inflators using sodium azide will be phased out over some period of time 
we recognized impairment charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal related to our sodium azide operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
sales of halotron amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
halotron is designed to replace halon based fire extinguishing systems 
accordingly  demand for halotron depends upon a number of factors including the willingness of consumers to switch from halon based systems  as well as existing and potential governmental regulations 
real estate sales amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the nature of real estate development and sales is such that we are unable reliably to predict any pattern of future real estate sales 
in addition  real estate sales are currently estimated to be completed by the end of fiscal we do not expect to receive any significant cash returns in the future from our interest in our residential joint venture project 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
environmental protection equipment sales accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
cost of sales 
the principal elements comprising our cost of sales are raw materials  electric power  labor  manufacturing overhead  depreciation and amortization and the book basis in real estate sold 
the major raw materials used in our production processes are graphite  sodium chlorate  ammonia  hydrochloric acid  sodium metal  nitrous oxide and hcfc significant increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse impact on margins if we are unable to pass along such increases to our customers 
during the first six months of fiscal  we received power bills from utah power that were approximately million in excess of average historical amounts 
during this period  we purchased greater quantities of certain raw materials because of these excessive power costs 
in the second half of fiscal  we recovered the excessive power costs through a settlement and curtailment arrangement with utah power 
as a result of these arrangements  our net power costs were approximately million less in fiscal compared to average historical annual amounts 
we now purchase power from utah power under the equivalent of utah electric service schedule no 
prices paid by us for raw materials have historically been relatively stable  although we have experienced cost increases on certain raw materials  particularly on hcfc used in the production of halotron 
all the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes have been available in commercial quantities  and we have had no difficulty obtaining necessary raw materials 
a substantial portion of the total cash costs of operating our specialty chemical plants  consisting mostly of labor and overhead  are largely fixed in nature 
income taxes 
in fiscal  we established a deferred tax valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we released our deferred tax valuation allowance and recognized approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net income 
although our net income and diluted net income per common share have not been subject to seasonal fluctuations  they have been and are expected to continue to be subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the following factors  among others i as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we may incur material legal and other costs associated with certain litigation and contingencies  ii the timing of real estate sales is not predictable  iii weighted average common and common equivalent shares for purposes of calculating diluted net income per common share are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the market price of our common stock due to outstanding warrants and options  iv the results of periodic reviews of impairment issues  v the ability to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers  and vi the magnitude  pricing and timing of ap  sodium azide  halotron  and environmental protection equipment sales in the future is uncertain 
see forward looking statements risk factors below 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september sales and operating revenues 
sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was principally attributable to an increase in specialty chemicals sales of million and an increase in real estate sales of million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in environmental protection equipment sales of approximately million 
the increase in specialty chemicals sales resulted principally from increased perchlorate shipments  offset in part by a decrease in shipments of sodium azide and halotron 
real estate sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due to an increase in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal these sales are expected to decline substantially in and by reason of the complete depletion of our real estate in nevada that is held for sale 
environmental protection equipment sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as of october   this segment had a backlog of approximately million 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales to sales was principally attributable to increased perchlorate shipments and an increase in real estate sales  which generally have a higher gross margin than our other products 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million  from million in fiscal most of the increases in operating expenses relate to costs incurred in connection with corporate and product development activities 
we have incurred increased costs relating to the evaluation and investigation of the potential for alternative uses and applications of certain of our existing and related products 
some of these opportunities may involve partnering or possible joint venture arrangements with others 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended september   we have experienced increases in operating expenses as a result of detailed due diligence activities directly related to corporate development opportunities 
operating expenses during each of the fiscal years and  also include approximately million in costs associated with the investigation and evaluation of trace amounts of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of our operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals environmental protection equipment real estate total the increases in operating income in our specialty chemicals industry segment was primarily attributable to an increase in perchlorate chemical shipments  offset partially by decreased halotron and sodium azide shipments 
the increase in operating income of our real estate segment was principally due to increased land sales 
the operating loss incurred in our environmental protection equipment business in fiscal was primarily due to decreased sales 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was principally due to lower average interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was due to the repurchase of million in notes in january fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september sales and operating revenues 
sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was principally attributable to lower specialty chemicals sales 
perchlorate chemical and sodium azide sales decreased approximately million due to lower volumes 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in halotron sales of approximately million in march  we received notification from thiokol of a change in the fiscal purchase order for ap that resulted in a decrease of approximately million pounds of ap from million pounds of ap 
we submitted a price adjustment claim under the change order and  in september  negotiated and settled the claim which resulted in a million payment from thiokol 
sales volume levels for ap declined from approximately million pounds in fiscal to approximately million pounds in fiscal ap sales volumes in fiscal were approximately million pounds 
see above for a discussion of the current status of the ap market 
real estate sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due to an increase in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal environmental protection equipment sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales to sales was principally attributable to decreased depreciation expense associated with our sodium azide operations  as a result of the impairment charge in fiscal discussed above 
in addition  because of the settlement and curtailment arrangement discussed above  net power costs were approximately million less in fiscal as compared to normalized historical annual amounts 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal to million  from million in fiscal operating expenses during the fiscal years ended and include approximately million and million  respectively  in costs associated with the investigation and evaluation of trace amounts of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
segment operating income 
operating income of our operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals environmental protection equipment real estate total the increase in operating income in our specialty chemicals industry segment was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of million recognized in fiscal the increase in operating income of our real estate segment was principally due to better margins on land sales 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was principally due to lower average interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal principally as a result of lower average debt balances 
inflation general inflation did not have a significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  general inflation may have an effect on gross profit in the future as certain of our agreements with ap and sodium azide customers require fixed prices  although certain of such agreements contain escalation features that should somewhat insulate us from increases in costs associated with inflation 
as discussed above  we have recently experienced increases in certain raw material costs and power costs  although we believe that such increases are not specifically related to the effects of general inflation 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash balances will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations  including debt related payments 
however  the resolution of litigation and contingencies  and the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for ap  sodium azide and halotron  may have an effect on the use and availability of cash 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
capital expenditures relate principally to specialty chemicals segment capital improvement projects 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during the three year period ended september   we made debt related payments of approximately million  repurchased million of our common stock and issued million of our common stock as a result of the exercise of outstanding stock options 
we may but are not obligated to continue to repurchase our common stock  but we are limited in our ability to use cash to repurchase stock by certain covenants contained in the indenture governing the notes 
our board of directors has approved a provision in our common stock repurchase program to permit repurchase of common stock from employees and directors 
the notes are redeemable at our option through february   at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes 
during the twelve month period beginning march   the notes are redeemable at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes 
we intend to redeem the notes on march  the total cost of the redemption  including interest on the notes  will be approximately million 
we will recognize a loss on the redemption of the notes of approximately million 
during the three year period ended september   we received cash of approximately million from our ventana canyon residential joint venture 
the venture is winding down its operations and we do not expect to receive any significant cash returns from this venture in the future 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the litigation and contingencies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have incurred legal and other costs  and we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods 
any such costs  to the extent borne by us and not recovered through insurance  would adversely affect our liquidity 
we are currently unable to predict or quantify the amount or range of such costs or the period of time over which such costs may be incurred

such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the risk factors set forth below 
the following risk factors  among others  may cause our operating results and or financial position to be adversely affected from time to time a declining demand including excess customer inventories or downward pricing pressure for our products as a result of general or specific economic conditions  b governmental budget decreases affecting the dod or nasa causing a decrease in demand for ap  c technological advances and improvements with respect to existing or new competitive products causing a reduction or elimination of demand for ap  sodium azide or halotron  d the ability and desire of purchasers to change existing products or substitute other products for our products based upon perceived quality  environmental effects and pricing  e the fact that perchlorate chemicals  sodium azide  halotron and our environmental products have limited applications and highly concentrated customer bases 
competitive factors including  but not limited to  our limitations respecting financial resources and our ability to compete against companies with substantially greater resources  significant excess market supply in the sodium azide market and recently in the perchlorate market  potential patent coverage issues  and the development or penetration of competing new products  particularly in the propulsion  airbag inflation and fire extinguishing businesses 
underutilization of our manufacturing facilities resulting in production inefficiencies and increased costs  the inability to recover facility costs  reductions in margins  and impairment issues 
risks associated with our real estate activities  including  but not limited to  dependence upon the las vegas commercial and industrial real estate markets  changes in general or local economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations affecting the availability and cost of financing and regulatory and environmental matters that may have a negative impact on sales 
the effects of  and changes in  trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations and other activities of governments  agencies or similar organizations  including  but not limited to  environmental  safety and transportation issues 
the cost and effects of legal and administrative proceedings  settlements and investigations  particularly those described in note to our consolidated financial statements and claims made by or against us relative to patents or property rights 
the dependence upon a single facility for the production of most of our products 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  and series d preferred stock  the potential dividend of preference stock purchase rights and related rights agreement could have the effect of making it more difficult for potential acquirors to obtain a control position in us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have certain long term fixed rate debt but do not currently maintain a revolving or other bank credit facility 
we believe that any market risk arising from our fixed rate debt is not material 
at september   we did not have any derivative based financial instruments 
however  the amount of outstanding debt may fluctuate and we may at some time be subject to refinancing risk
