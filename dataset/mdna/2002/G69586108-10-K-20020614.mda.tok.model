table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make a variety of estimates that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
the following accounting policies are currently considered most critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
based on the above criteria  our revenue is recognized when product has been shipped and title to the product has transferred to the customer 
title of the product may transfer to the end customer or distributor when shipped or when received by the customer based on a specific agreement 
we evaluate the provision for estimated returns monthly  based on historical sales and returns 
to date we have not experienced significant returns 
any increase in the level of returns could have a material and adverse effect on out financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at march  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
if circumstances change  such as the incurrence of higher than expected defaults or unexpected material adverse change occurs regarding a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we test such assets for a potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying 
table of contents value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
deferred taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more unlikely than likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
overview the following information is based on  and should be read with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report

our primary uses of cash have been to fund capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities and operations  dividend payments and working capital requirements 
we intend to continue to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business operations and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of march  our net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash generated in operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily caused by the operating loss incurred during fiscal the increase in cash generated in operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of the increase in our operating profit in fiscal our net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million  million and million for the acquisition of new equipment in our current facility and  nil  million and million for the construction of an additional facility in shenzhen  the prc during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as of march   we had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures may vary substantially from those budgeted or estimated for a variety of reasons  including 
table of contents changes in market conditions  unavailability or changes in scheduled delivery of specific equipment  changes in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we plan to continue to expand capacity in future periods from cash on hand  including cash flow from operations and new bank borrowings as required 
we lease office and warehouse facilities under various leases that expire through total future minimum commitments under these leases amount to approximately million 
as of march   we had no outstanding indebtedness 
for more information  see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
if the customs authorities of the prc require us to post a bond in connection with our exemption status from prc duties on imported raw materials and exported products  we will experience a substantial drain of our liquid resources 
we cannot assure that we will be able to provide the required bond at a commercially feasible cost  or at all 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock and trends 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to  worth of our common stock at prices not to exceed of our net asset value per share 
common stock repurchased will be cancelled immediately 
during the year ended march   we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average cost of per share 
in addition  pursuant to an offer by us to purchase up to  trends  on may    trends were tendered by their holders to us and were purchased by us at each 
as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
if our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain debt financing 
the can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or if available  will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
from time to time  we may evaluate possible investments or acquisitions and may  if a suitable opportunity arises  make such an investment or acquisition

hong kong profits tax under the hong kong tax authority s departmental interpretation and practice note no 
 a company based in hong kong but with substantially all of its manufacturing operations located in the prc conducted pursuant to a processing agreement entered into with a prc company can enjoy profit apportionment through which much of its manufacturing profit is subject to hong kong profits tax 
substantially all of our manufacturing operations are located in shenzhen  the prc and conducted pursuant to a processing agreement entered into with a prc company 
effective as of april   the profits tax rate in hong kong is  a change from the former profits tax rate  which was 
under our current profits apportionment  only of our profits are subject to hong kong profits tax and  as a result  we enjoy a lower effective tax rate than would otherwise be the case 
however  the hong kong tax authority may not continue to grant this tax concession to hong kong companies with manufacturing operations in the prc  or we may lose this concession in the future as a result of changes in hong kong tax law or the interpretation of such law 
in the event that these tax concessions are unavailable to us  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
although traditionally  hong kong has allowed a company like ours to apportion only of its profits to activities outside hong kong not subject to hong kong tax  starting in fiscal  for tax filing purposes  we 
table of contents have apportioned approximately of our profits to activities outside of hong kong 
the hong kong tax authorities are examining our activities with respect to several factors that they use to ascertain the true geographic nature of a company s activities 
although we believe our apportionment to be justified  the hong kong tax authorities may insist on a different apportionment that would subject us to payment of back taxes 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations  which prohibits the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and addresses the accounting for purchase method business combinations completed after june  we believe that the adoption of sfas no

also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
for existing acquisitions  the provisions of sfas no 
were effective as of april  and are generally effective for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
includes provisions regarding the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  the cessation of amortization related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  and the testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles annually or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that within six months of adoption  goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of the date of adoption 
if any impairment is indicated to have existed upon adoption  it should be measured and recorded before the end of the year of adoption 
sfas no 
requires that any goodwill impairment loss recognized as a result of initial application be reported in the first interim period of adoption as a change in accounting principle  and that the income per share effects of the accounting change be separately disclosed 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
does not have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or business practices 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rate fluctuations our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars while our cost of goods sold are generally incurred in us dollars  hong kong dollars and renminbi  and our operating expenses are generally denominated in renminbi  hong kong dollars and us dollars 
in addition  a substantial portion of our capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of equipment  has been and is expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars and japanese yen 
consequently  a portion of our costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and other currencies 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of new or additional currency controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
primarily in response to recent developments in the southeast asian currency markets  we from time to time engage in derivative trading activities  such as entering into forward contracts  to hedge our currency exchange exposure 
we do not utilize market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
at march   we have entered into foreign exchange contracts of million nil to purchase singapore dollars 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties to the contracts 
however  we do not anticipate non performance because the counterparties are major financial institutions 
many of our competitors are located in countries whose currencies devalued significantly against the us dollar beginning in the second half of as a result of such devaluation  these competitors products have become less expensive in us dollar terms 
this reduction could result in our customers purchasing products from these competitors rather than from us  which would have a material and adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
as the hong kong dollar is officially pegged to the us dollar and the renminbi is controlled by the prc government such that it only trades within a limited range against the us dollar  unless there are significant changes in the policies of the hong kong and the prc government  fluctuations in the exchange rates of hong kong dollar and the renminbi are not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
pvc compound price pvc compound  the principal material used in the manufacture of tubes  accounted for  and of our total raw material costs in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while we believe  primarily as a result of increased production capacity by suppliers  that a severe shortage in the supply of pvc compound is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that such shortage will not occur 
any price increases would result in higher costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently maintain approximately two to three months stock of pvc compound and other raw materials used in our production processes  and increase such stock when we believe prices are favorable 
we do not  and do not intend to  enter into future contracts or use any financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the price of pvc compound or other raw materials used in our production processes
