industry the digital lifestyle digital appliances are changing the way people live their lives 
with a digital still camera or video camcorder and email  for example  it is now possible to share important moments with friends and relatives a world away  almost as they re happening 
with a handheld computer  it is possible to send and receive messages through the airwaves 
with a dvd or cd burner  it is easy to create digital photo albums  movies or music collections at home or even while traveling 
a digital lifestyle isn t one product or a collection of products it reflects how consumers define  create and share their lives by using digital appliances 
it is also the rapidly changing  rapidly growing market to which we position and sell our products 
these are some of the trends we believe are shaping the digital lifestyle trend digital appliances are widespread 
cellular phones  digital music players  personal digital assistants  or pdas  digital still cameras  digital video camcorders  voice recorders  devices that burn digital content to cds and dvds tens of millions of people today have a digital appliance of some sort 
according to idc and nikkei market access  million digital still cameras were sold worldwide in  the forecasted worldwide sales for  and are million  million and million units  respectively 
according to idc  million cd read write drives were sold worldwide in  the numbers for  and are projected to be million  million and million units  respectively 
according to magnetic media information services  worldwide shipments of dvd video players for were between and million units  in  worldwide sales are expected to exceed million units 
we believe that the growth in digital appliances will continue with the rapid development and enhancement of these products  insuring their appeal to an appreciative and ready to buy consumer market 
trend the role of the pc is changing 
the computer age is rapidly becoming the digital age 
in the s  personal computers were business productivity tools for word processing  desktop publishing and spreadsheets 
with growing use of the internet beginning in the s  personal computers became gateways to vast warehouses of information and services 
they also functioned as post offices at home and at the office for sending and receiving electronic mail 
today  personal computers are playing a new role in consumer homes they are becoming the axis of the world of consumer digital appliances 
personal computers now store the music  video  pictures and data consumers create and collect with their digital appliances  burn music  photos and other data to cds and dvds for playback in other devices  and organize digital files and backup data from digital appliances  which then can be saved on portable storage devices connected to the personal computer 
as technology advances  consumers will also need personal computers or other devices that function as the hub in a home information network  working easily with stereo systems  security devices  televisions  appliances and other devices that will be in consumer homes 
trend removable media is convenient  but different formats don t work together 
most digital appliances use removable media for storing information 
among the most common types are toshiba s smartmedia  sony s memory stick and sandisk s compactflash and secure digital cards 
other formats  like optical disks in various sizes  are growing in use 
removable media is easy to carry  durable  reusable and available at a growing number of retail locations 
because these media differ in size  shape and format  however  they cannot be used interchangeably and there is no trend among media manufacturers to standardize 
the inability of one removable media format to communicate directly with another will continue  as will the resulting confusion that frustrates consumers who use those media 
this means consumers must either buy digital appliances that use the same removable media type or wrestle with sharing data stored on one media format with another and with their personal computer 
trend advances in connectivity are enhancing the uses of digital appliances 
there are two major standards of connectivity between computers and peripheral devices intel s universal serial bus usb and ieee  also known as firewire 
the ability to interconnect digital appliances to each other and to a personal computer gives consumers more choices in how  when and where they lead their digital lives 
they can burn cds of music or video on airplanes while traveling  for example 
connectivity through usb or firewire opens up many new uses for digital appliances 
ports for both usb and firewire are readily available on windows and macintosh personal computers and in peripherals like keyboards  mice  cd read write  or cd r w  drives and more 
many digital appliances feature built in usb ports 
usb is enjoying increased interest with the recent release of version  which provides transmission speeds meeting or exceeding those of firewire 
firewire is being incorporated into more personal computers and peripherals like digital tvs  digital video recorders and set top boxes 
it has become the connectivity standard used in both consumer and professional video applications  where it is critical that not a single frame be dropped or lost in transmission 
as consumers demand  create and collect increasing amounts of digital music  digital video  very high resolution photos and other digital content that requires large file sizes  the demand for firewire connectivity should also increase 
trend consumers need portable storage devices for their digital content 
with increased use of digital appliances and speedy connectivity technologies comes an increase in the amount of digital content consumers create and collect 
consumers now also expect to use that data in multiple locations and in multiple ways 
there is  in fact  an interesting shift in priority taking place among consumers where once they valued most importantly their digital appliances and digital gadgets  they now place more importance on their digital content 
there are many choices for consumers for portable storage optical drives cd and dvd reader writers  palm sized hard disks  miniature drive mechanisms like ibm s one inch microdrive  miniature hard disk drives like our firefly drive based on toshiba s inch drive  and still larger storage devices that incorporate inch drives  such as our firelite family 
for consumers desiring to store data away from a personal computer  lightweight  portable hard drives and palm sized hard drives are gaining popularity 
they can be used on multiple personal computers  work with palmtop computers  interface with a variety of digital appliances  and provide suitable performance for even very demanding applications 
trend it s getting harder to tell where one technology ends and another begins 
electronics superstores now carry products with overlapping technologies 
pdas are email stations 
children s digital cameras record text messages 
picture frames connect to a pc or the internet to display a constantly changing series of photos 
while the benefit of this cross breeding is that digital appliances offer consumers increased functionality  the downside is that those same appliances can be harder to use and to understand 
we believe that the convergence of technologies is leading to a battle over the emerging home information network  and the technology that controls the home network will become the gatekeeper of communications into and out of the home 
contenders for this role include the personal computer  with its fast processing speed and volumes of storage 
but set top gaming boxes  like sony s playstation and microsoft s xbox  are becoming alternatives 
they offer better graphics and faster start up times than many pcs and still offer plenty of space for information storage 
hooked to a cable system or in connection with a satellite  they can potentially offer faster access to the internet than a personal computer 
there is also interactive tv  best exemplified by microsoft s webtv 
with an external storage device and a cd burner  it may become yet another alternative center for home communications 
we also see other trends emerging 
broadband installations in homes are rapidly increasing 
more and more content  like movies  special event telecasts  lectures and music is readily available to consumers for download 
lower prices for connections  services  content and equipment are making consumer electronics manufacturers scramble to become the kings of the networked home 
beyond the trends living a digital lifestyle today digital lifestyle technologies can be complex  but consumer wants and needs are easy to understand it s easy to create and collect digital content like photos  music  video  books and other information 
because of this  consumers need tools to use and store that content 
but before they can use it  consumers need user friendly tools for organizing content 
consumers want to combine their content into personalized slideshows or presentations and to share their creations with others 
with increasingly mobile lives  consumers need easier ways to connect their digital appliances to each other  to a personal computer and to the internet so they can use and store information both at home and on the road 
favorite songs on cds or cassette tapes  photos stored in boxes in a closet  mm slides in a long forgotten carousel consumers want to weave legacy content into their digital lifestyles 
getting digital content in large quantities and in large files to the personal computer quickly and reliably is a requirement 
consumers are intrigued by technology s promises for the future 
today  however  they are trying to determine the best way to share digital video of their children s birthday parties with grandparents who don t own a digital video camera or personal computer 
consumers love the freedom of a digital lifestyle  but still need guidance to live it and enjoy it fully 
our company opportunity we believe that rapid technology advances  consumer appetites for all things digital and a worldwide economy increasingly dependent on computers and the internet have created significant opportunity for us the digital lifestyle market is young and rapidly growing 
consumers seek complete solutions to manage and enjoy living a digital lifestyle 
our existing products are known for their innovative designs and their reliability 
solution we provide comprehensive devices and software solutions for moving  managing  creating and storing digital content among digital appliances  pcs and the internet 
our products include external portable hard disk drives and floppy disk drives for desktop and notebook pcs  external cd read write recorders  flash memory card readers and dvd and cd creation software 
our products are generally available for both windows and macintosh operating systems  allowing the original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and retailers that market our products to reach a large installed base of potential users 
our current and planned products are designed to offer the following principal benefits design 
we emphasize innovative product designs that are both attractive and that enhance usability 
our usb flash memory readers  for example  feature an upright  ergonomic design that allow users to insert and eject media with just one hand 
our firefly and firelite drives feature aesthetically pleasing industrial designs 
portability 
we place a premium on features that allow users to carry and use our products in a variety of settings 
these features include compact designs  no requirement for a power adapter and no requirement for installed software drivers 
we also offer carry cases that protect our products and make them easier to transport 
ease of use 
our products are easy to use and install 
our personal storage systems address the storage needs of today s consumers portability  user friendliness  reliability and seamless integration with computer operating systems 
these storage devices also offer our proprietary software that enhances the user s experience  further differentiating our products from competitors offerings 
our flashpath floppy disk adapter and usb connected flash media readers allow the consumer to conveniently transfer digital content from a digital camera or other appliance to a personal computer by simply inserting the flash memory card in the reader and copying its contents to the pc 
the interface standard supported by our usb flash media readers eliminates any driver software for most of today s windows and macintosh operating systems 
unlike serial and parallel port based products  our flash memory products do not rely upon a digital appliance s power source to transfer digital data from a flash memory card to a pc 
for example  our usb media readers are powered by the personal computer 
this is important because digital appliances  such as digital cameras  consume significant amounts of power and require frequent battery replacement or recharging 
products that use serial or parallel cable interfaces quickly drain power from digital appliances  making those competing products less attractive 
also  consumers find portable products much more convenient to use if those products don t require batteries or a c adapters 
our software products allow users to compose slide or video shows  create dvds and cds  and play them with or away from a pc  without the need to learn the world of media and optical formats 
versatility 
our products can be used with a variety of pc hardware platforms and software environments 
as a result  the same media reader that is used to transfer images from one digital camera to a microsoft based pc can be used to transfer images from another digital camera to an apple computer 
similarly  the same media reader that is used to transfer images may also be used to transfer voice and other digital data from a variety of digital appliances that use the same flash memory card 
our personal storage systems are also compatible with both windows and macintosh operating systems

our distribution and reseller channels also provide marketing support 
operations during the fourth quarter of  we completed the assimilation of our acton  massachusetts operations into the naples facility 
as part of this transfer  virtually all product manufacturing was transferred to asia 
we now outsource our manufacturing to independent  contracted companies in the philippines  japan  and taiwan 
under our manufacturing arrangements  we receive fully assembled and tested products based upon our proprietary designs and specifications 
we select our manufacturers based upon their reputations for quality  their cost structures  their production capacities and their support of state of the art manufacturing processes and systems 
this strategy allows us to focus on our core research  product design and development capabilities  and to reduce the substantial capital investment required to manufacture our products 
we believe that our use of experienced  high volume manufacturers provides greater manufacturing specialization and expertise  higher levels of flexibility and responsiveness  and faster delivery of product than in house manufacturing 
in addition  we frequently seek the advice of our experienced manufacturers with respect to design changes that reduce manufacturing costs or lead times or increase the manufacturing yields and the quality of our finished products 
to ensure that our products manufactured by others meet our standards  our production engineers generally work with our contract manufacturers throughout the production process

we have also selected the im logistics division of ingram micro inc  the largest global wholesale provider of technology and supply chain management  as our fulfillment and logistics provider 
im logistics manages our warehousing  inventory  order management and transportation processes to help optimize our operations 
toshiba 
toshiba corporation  a leading electronics company  played a critical role in our early development stage 
toshiba made an equity investment and introduced us to most of the key technical personnel that now constitute our tokyo based general management  applied engineering and production engineering team 
toshiba continues to provide cooperative support in several areas 
competition the market for digital connectivity  storage products  multimedia management and dvd cd creation software is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences 
we believe that competition is likely to intensify as a result of increasing demand for digital appliances 
in the digital accessories and hardware peripherals markets we face competition from numerous providers of cable and other non cable interfaces  including ports  usb and infrared interfaces  and stand alone firewire and usb personal storage devices 
there are no competitors known to us that offer a digital connectivity product for flash memory in the inch floppy format 
we believe that important competitive factors in our markets are quality  performance  price  time to market introduction  ease of use  reliability and technical service and support 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors 
in order for us to compete successfully against current and future competitors  we continue to shorten our time to market introduction  incorporate new design and technology features  reduce manufacturing costs  and differentiate our products through effective marketing and advertising 
employees as of december   we had full time employees working in the united states  europe and japan  including employees engaged in research and development  engaged in sales and marketing and engaged in general and administrative activities  which includes certain executive officers  finance  operations and information systems personnel 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe our employee relations are good 
backlog our backlog at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the decrease in backlog of approximately million resulted primarily from the decrease in sales to our oem customers 
a substantial portion of our backlog is typically scheduled for delivery within days 
variations in the size and delivery schedules of purchase orders received by us  as well as changes in customers delivery requirements  may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period 
accordingly  we believe that backlog cannot be considered a meaningful indicator of future financial results 
item properties our corporate headquarters are located in naples  florida where we lease approximately  square feet of space 
our japanese subsidiary leases approximately  square feet of office space in tokyo  which serves as the headquarters for our asian manufacturing management and for our asian sales team 
our subsidiary in the united kingdom leases approximately  square feet of office space and approximately  square feet of warehouse space in farnborough  england  which serves as the sales and distribution center of our digital connectivity and personal storage products to the european market

results of operations general during  we acquired vst technologies  or vst  and impleo limited  or impleo  which provided us with a line of personal storage products and greater access to the european market 
these transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
because of the acquisitions of vst and impleo during  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results are meaningful or predictive of future performance 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues our product revenues are recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  which is generally at the time of shipment 
title and risk of loss are transferred when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is assured 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on shipments to certain customers until the customers have resold the products 
we record a provision for estimated product returns at the time the related revenue is recognized on sales to certain customers that have rights of return 
product revenues at our japanese subsidiary are recognized upon acceptance by the customer 
total product revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in demand for our products arising from the anticipated decline in the use of the inch floppy drive as a flash memory card interface  a decline in demand for expansion bay products due to the redesign of apple laptop computers  which no longer contain expansion bay capabilities  a continued weakness in the worldwide economy and a decline in research and development revenue 
our product revenues from the sale of personal storage products decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in demand for our usb and firewire based products arising from the continued weakness in the worldwide economy  as well as a decline in demand for expansion bay products due to the redesign of apple laptop computers  which no longer have expansion bay capabilities 
in addition we decreased the sale prices of various personal storage products during the year in order to stimulate market demand 
we plan to discontinue some lower margin or non strategic personal storage products in our product revenues from the sale of digital connectivity products decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the decline in the use of the inch floppy drive as a flash memory card interface  as consumers move toward devices with higher data transfer rates  such as our usb based flash media readers 
in addition  demand for our products declined as a result of the continued weakness in the worldwide economy 
both of these factors are contributing to the decline in our flashpath products 
we expect this trend to continue during  resulting in lower revenues from digital connectivity products as compared to the revenue associated with these products 
our research and development revenue is recognized upon final customer acceptance of our work performed under the terms of the agreement 
our revenues from research and development agreements were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in new research and development agreements during the year 
we earned the significant portion of our research and development revenues in from a research and development agreement  which was completed during the quarter ended june  although we expect to continue to enter into additional research and development agreements for the development of new technologies as opportunities surface  we currently do not have plans to enter into any such agreements 
our license fees and royalty revenues primarily consist of fees earned from a license agreement on our safeboot intellectual property 
our revenues from license fees and royalty agreements were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the expiration of the license agreement in and purchase of the safeboot intellectual property by the licensee 
currently  these revenues represent less than two percent of our total revenues for the year ended december  although we expect to enter into additional licensing agreements for our existing and future intellectual property  we currently do not have plans to enter into any such agreements 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the purchased cost of product  packaging  storage  freight  scrap and inventory provisions  as well as royalties for some of our digital connectivity products and personal storage products 
cost of revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease in cost was due primarily to lower sales volume of our flashpath products and certain personal storage products  offset in part by inventory writedowns of aging products of approximately million 
our cost of revenues from the sales of personal storage products decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales volume of our personal storage products due to a decline in demand  which was offset in part by approximately million of inventory writedowns during the year arising from the decrease in demand for certain legacy storage products 
our cost of revenues from the sales of digital connectivity products decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the decline in demand for our flashpath products 
in addition  the cost of revenues for include an inventory writedown of approximately million associated with our flashpath for multimedia card due to our discontinuance of that product 
gross profit our gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  or of total revenue  compared to approximately million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  this decrease in the amount of gross profit is primarily attributable to declines in sales arising from declines in demand for our flashpath products and various aging personal storage products with declining margins and the decrease in research and development revenue 
in addition  we recognized inventory writedowns  associated with our connectivity products and aging legacy storage products  which decreased the amount of gross profit by approximately million and the gross margin percentage from approximately to the reported 
our gross profit from sales of personal storage products for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  or of personal storage revenue  compared to approximately million  or of personal storage revenue  for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december  our gross profit decreased in due to a decline in demand for our storage products and inventory writedowns associated with our aging legacy storage products 
this decrease was offset by lower writedowns of inventory in as compared to in  our inventory writedowns were approximately million as compared to approximately million in excluding the inventory writedowns  the margins on our personal storage products would have been approximately in and approximately in our gross profit from sales of digital connectivity products for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  or of digital connectivity revenue  compared to approximately million  or of digital connectivity revenue  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for our flashpath products resulting from the anticipated decline in the use of the inch floppy drive as a flash memory card interface and inventory writedowns of approximately million associated with our flashpath for multimedia card product due to our discontinuance of that product 
because we expect our distribution into more traditional consumer electronic and mass retail channels to account for a larger portion of our digital connectivity sales in the future  we expect gross margins on those sales to remain relatively consistent with the current level 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and payroll related expenses for our design and development engineers  as well as prototype supplies and contract or professional services 
these expenses decreased to approximately million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this decrease in expenditures was primarily attributable to cost savings realized due to the closing of our acton  massachusetts operation as well as other actions taken to control or reduce operating expenses 
research and development expenses related to our personal storage products were primarily incurred for the development of our new firefly and firelite line of hard disk drive products  and our firewire x cd r w product 
research and development expenses related to digital connectivity products were incurred to support the development of our usb flash media readers as well as the maintenance of existing products 
in addition  research and development expenses were incurred in support of the development of our mvp software product and our dvd authoring products 
we believe that the introduction of new products is important to our growth and will require continuation of research and development expenditures 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include salaries  benefits and travel expenses for our sales  marketing and product management personnel in the united states  japan and the united kingdom 
these expenses also include other selling and marketing expenditures for items such as trade shows  advertising  marketing and other promotional programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in expenditures was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing and sales personnel to support the launch of new products and the broadening of our distribution into more traditional consumer electronic and mass retail channels  an increase in advertising and promotional programs in support of our mvp software product and the inclusion of vst s results for the twelve months ended december  compared to the period from march  to december  in the preceding year

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and related expenses of our executive management  finance  information systems  operations  technical support  human resources  legal and administrative functions  as well as leases  utilities  maintenance  insurance  professional services  legal and accounting fees  depreciation and amortization 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of vst s results for the twelve months ended december  compared to the period from march  to december  in the preceding year and integration expenses associated with the closing of our acton  massachusetts facility and the relocation of those operations into our naples  florida headquarters 
this increase was offset in part by cost savings realized due to the closing of our acton  massachusetts operation as well as other actions taken to control or reduce operating expenses 
during the year ended december   we recognized non recurring expenses of approximately million for costs associated with the closing of our acton  massachusetts operation  including employee severance  buyout of a facility lease and disposal of property and equipment 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets as of december   our intangible assets primarily consisted of goodwill and separately identified intangible assets recognized in connection with our acquisitions completed in  which were recorded under the purchase method of accounting 
the separately identified intangible assets acquired consist of non compete agreements  distribution channels  trade names  patents and workforce in place 
these intangible assets have lives ranging from one to five years from the date of acquisition 
purchase price not allocated to separately identified intangible assets was allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is amortized over a five year life from the date of acquisition 
for the year ended december   amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets totaled approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the amortization associated with the acquisition of vst and impleo for the twelve months ended december  compared to the period from march  to december  for vst and april  to december  for impleo  which was partially offset by a reduction in fourth quarter amortization due to the recording of an impairment writedown of the goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets recorded in connection with the vst acquisition 
impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets we continually evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period  the market capitalization relative to net book value and significant negative industry or economic trends which indicate that this trend may continue for an indefinite period of time 
if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment measured is based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on the impairment review performed for the quarter ended september   we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets recorded in connection with the vst acquisition 
in addition  based on the impairment review performed for the quarter ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets recorded in connection with the impleo acquisition 
these charges were determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
the assumptions supporting future cash flows  including the discount rate  were determined using our best estimates 
closing of acton facility on may   we announced our intention to close our acton  massachusetts facility and move those operations into our naples  florida headquarters 
this closing allowed us to centralize our operations and marketing and development efforts  improve operational efficiencies and otherwise increase the effectiveness of our business

the most significant component of these items  for the year ended december   was interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  which was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease in interest income is due to a reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments due to cash used during the year and lower interest rates earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments arising from reductions in the federal funds rate established by the federal open market committee during in addition  during  we recorded a gain of approximately million due to the sale of the safeboot intellectual property by the licensee 
these items were offset by approximately million in property and equipment writedowns associated with the closing of our acton  massachusetts facility 
interest expense interest expense is incurred on the lines of credit in japan and the united kingdom 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million compared to the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to a repayment of a large portion of the bank line of credit in japan  resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable  which represents the borrowing base for the credit facility 
income tax expense benefit we are subject to tax in the united states  japan  switzerland and the united kingdom 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
for the year ended december   income tax benefit totaled approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the amount consisted of income tax benefits of approximately million primarily resulting from amortization expense on certain intangible assets related to the vst and impleo acquisitions partially offset by approximately million of expense 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standard no  accounting for income taxes  we have a net deferred tax liability of approximately million as of december  based on our limited operating history and the cumulative losses from the most recent three years  a valuation allowance in the full amount of the deferred tax asset is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes and approximately million for united kingdom income tax purposes 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total product revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to sales of personal storage products subsequent to the acquisition of vst in march and an increase in sales of our digital connectivity products 
for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december   revenues from personal storage products were approximately million 
sales of personal storage products declined in the fourth quarter of  primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of our usb and firewire based personal storage products for the apple market resulting from a decrease in demand for that market 
our product revenues from the sale of digital connectivity products increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  we earned the significant portion of our research and development revenues from a research and development agreement  which was completed during the quarter ended march  our total revenues from research and development agreements were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  our license fees and royalty revenues represent less than two percent of our total revenues for the year ended december  cost of revenues cost of revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase in cost was due primarily to sales of personal storage products subsequent to the acquisition of vst and an increase in sales of our digital connectivity products

gross profit our gross profit for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  or of total revenue  compared to approximately million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  this increase in the amount of gross profit is primarily attributable to sales of personal storage products subsequent to the acquisition of vst in march  which also contributed to the decrease in our gross margin percentage since the gross margin on personal storage products is typically less than on digital connectivity products 
in addition  we recognized inventory writedowns primarily on our personal storage products during the fourth quarter of  which reduced margins from approximately to the reported 
for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december   gross profit from sales of personal storage products was approximately million  or of personal storage revenue 
this amount includes inventory writedowns in the fourth quarter arising from a decrease in demand for personal storage products

sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change from to was primarily attributable to the acquisition of vst and impleo 
with the acquisition of vst in march and the acquisition of impleo in april  we added a number of new products to our existing product lines  significantly increasing our total sales and marketing expenses 
these added products required more catalog and magazine advertising than we have needed in the past due to our oem relationships

amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets for the year ended december   amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets totaled approximately million 
gain on foreign exchange gain on foreign exchange increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to less than million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the effect of the devaluation of the japanese yen and the british pound versus the us dollar during the period on the remeasurement of us dollar denominated receivables

during  we financed our operations and repaid loans outstanding through short term borrowings and the sale of equity securities in private placements with several strategic investors 
the main contributor to the cash provided in was the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock in our ipo in october during and  we financed our operations  acquisitions and repaid loans outstanding with a portion of the proceeds from our ipo 
we maintain a line of credit in the united states under which we may borrow up to million 
any amounts borrowed under this line of credit bear interest at over the day libor rate and are secured by certain short term investments 
this line of credit expires in july as of december   no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit 
however  at december   there was approximately million in standby letters of credit outstanding  which were issued to certain vendors to guarantee credit terms

we hope to enter into a new credit facility in the future 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and anticipated capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we may need to raise additional capital if we expand more rapidly than currently planned  to develop and market new or enhanced products and or services  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
the capital  if needed  may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
estimates have been made by us in several areas  including  but not limited to  the realizability of deferred tax assets  the future obligations associated with litigation  inventory reserves  warranty reserves and the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns and other credits 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our product revenues are recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  which is generally at the time of shipment 
title and risk of loss are transferred when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is assured 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on shipments to certain customers until the customers have resold the products 
we record a provision for estimated product returns at the time the related revenue is recognized on sales to certain customers that have rights of return 
product revenues at our japanese subsidiary are recognized upon acceptance by the customer 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection and other incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take action to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
in addition  if our customers redeem a greater amount of incentives than estimated by us  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
accounts receivable significant customers we generate approximately of our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to two customers in the personal computer and information technology industries 
as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable were attributable to these customers 
if our primary customers experience significant adverse conditions in their respective industries or operations  including the continued impact of the current downturn in demand for personal computers  our customers may not be able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to us for prior sales or complete the purchase of additional products from us under the terms of our existing firm purchase and sale commitments 
outstanding sales orders from these customers approximated million as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantive downgrading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due ranging from for current amounts to for amounts more than days past due based on our historical experience on a weighted average basis over the prior two years 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory reserves we had inventory reserves of approximately million as of december   for obsolete  slow moving  and non saleable inventory 
we evaluate the need for reserves based on a quarterly review of forecasted demand and market values for our products 
inventory reserves are established to the extent that the cost of the inventory exceeds the estimated market value of the inventory based on assumptions regarding future demand in relation to existing inventory balances and market conditions 
inventory reserves are applied directly to specific items 
short product life cycles are inherent in the high technology market 
product and technology transitions announced by us or our competitors  delays in the availability of new products  changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers and distribution partners  or adverse global economic conditions may materially affect estimates of our inventory reserve requirements resulting in additional inventory writedowns 
we recognized inventory writedowns of approximately million in compared to approximately million and million in and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we evaluate a variety of factors in determining the amount of deferred income tax assets to be recognized pursuant to sfas no 
 including our earnings history  the number of years that our operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences  near term earnings expectations  and the highly competitive nature of the high technology market 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was approximately million 
this valuation allowance is determined based on estimates of our future taxable income by tax jurisdiction and incorporates ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance 
in the event management determines that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase reported net income in the period the determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
the requirements of sfas no 
are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the amortization provisions of sfas no 
are effective upon adoption of sfas no 
companies are required to adopt sfas no 
in their fiscal year beginning after december  ie  january  for calendar year companies 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
however  for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of goodwill amortization 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale

factors that may affect future results of operations our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following 
in addition  the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  whether made in this form k  our annual or quarterly reports to shareholders  future press releases  sec filings or orally  whether in presentations  responses to questions or otherwise 
see forward looking statements 
we have incurred net losses and cannot guarantee that we will be profitable in the future 
except for the third and fourth quarters of  we have incurred net losses on a quarterly basis since inception 
we had a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of million in after tax amortization and writedowns of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets from the vst and impleo acquisitions 
in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in light of our loss history and the amortization and impairment writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets from the vst and impleo acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future 
reduced consumer demand for our flashpath products may have a significant impact on our business 
our current flashpath products and other flash media readers are designed to provide connectivity between personal computers and digital appliances that use flash memory cards 
our current dependence on sales of flashpath exposes us to a substantial risk of loss in the event that the flash memory market does not continue or if a competing technology replaces flash memory cards 
if a competing memory storage device replaces or takes significant market share from the flash memory cards which our digital connectivity products support  we will not be able to sell our products in quantities sufficient to grow or maintain our current business 
since our flashpath products work only in conjunction with the inch floppy disk drive  advances in flash memory cards may make these products less competitive because of the increased time needed to transfer data using the inch floppy disk drive 
consumer acceptance of our flashpath products depends upon their ability to quickly transfer information from flash memory cards to pcs 
however  the time needed to transfer information using a inch disk drive increases as more data is transferred 
as more memory is condensed onto flash memory cards  the time necessary to transfer all of the data from a single card will increase 
as technological advances make it possible and feasible to produce higher density cards  flashpath will be constrained by the inherent limitations of the inch disk drive 
in that case  flashpath would be less attractive to consumers and our sales would decline 
a reduction in the use of the inch floppy disk drive by consumers and manufacturers is contributing to the decrease in sales of our flashpath products 
our current flashpath products only work in conjunction with the standard inch floppy disk drive 
while the inch floppy disk drive is found today in most pcs  a number of newer pc models do not have this device and new industry standards may emerge that render the inch floppy disk drive obsolete 
advances in input devices such as cd rom and external data storage disk drives  such as zip drives  are reducing the need for the inch floppy diskette  which is contributing to the decrease in sales of our flashpath products 
in the future  we will have to rely on our other products and develop new products that use a different interface between personal computers and digital appliances 
our sales of digital connectivity products may also be harmed if a single standard for flash memory cards emerges 
we believe that demand for our flash memory connectivity products is also driven  to a large extent  by the absence of a single standard for flash memory cards 
there are currently five major flash memory cards  none of which has emerged as the industry standard 
should one of these cards or a new technology emerge as an industry standard  flash memory card readers could be built into pcs  eliminating the need for our current flash memory connectivity products 
we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our personal storage products to sustain our future growth if pc manufacturers do not adopt ieee as a high speed peripheral interface or if a competing cpu interface displaces or prevents the widespread adoption of ieee a substantial portion of our business depends on the adoption of institute of electrical and electronics engineering  or ieee  technology by pc manufacturers 
ieee is a high speed pc interface that is replacing small computer system interface  or scsi  and parallel interfaces 
if these manufacturers do not include an ieee interface on their pcs or notebook computers  then we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our firewire personal storage products to support our future growth 
firewire is apple s trade name for ieee for example  a competing high speed interface  such as universal serial bus  or usb   could emerge as an industry standard  thus limiting the demand for our firewire technology and related personal storage products 
we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our personal storage products to support our business if suppliers of our drives develop native firewire based personal storage products that do not require our firewire conversion technology 
we embed conversion asics and integrated software drivers in the hard disk drives we obtain from our suppliers  which enables our firewire based personal storage products to be used with firewire equipped computers 
we license this technology and the firmware from lsi logic  texas instruments and other integrated circuit suppliers 
if our suppliers of drives were to develop a native firewire solution that does not require the conversion asics and drivers embedded in our products  then we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our firewire personal storage products to support our business 
most of our revenue is derived from only a few major products and our business will be seriously harmed if demand for those products declines 
to date  substantially all of our revenue has been derived from the sale of only a few major products 
while our long term strategy is to derive revenue from multiple products  we anticipate that the sale of our flashpath products and our usb and firewire storage products will continue to represent the most substantial portion of our net revenue through and into a decline in the price of or demand for these products as a result of competition  technological change  the introduction of new products by us or others  a failure to adequately manage product transitions  or for other reasons  would seriously harm our business 
during the year ended december   we derived approximately of our product revenue from the sale of flashpath and usb and firewire based personal storage products 
we must develop new products and introduce them in a timely manner in order to remain competitive 
we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance products that shorten product life cycles 
to be competitive in this demanding market  we must both continue to refine current products so that they remain competitive  and continually design  develop and introduce  in a timely manner  new products that meet the performance and price demands of oems and consumers 
product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in technology  coordinate our technical personnel and strategic relationships  and identify and eliminate design flaws 
these development activities will require the investment of substantial resources before revenue is derived from product sales 
any significant delay in releasing new products would adversely affect our reputation  provide a competitor a first to market opportunity or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
further  we may not be able to recoup research and development expenditures if new products are not widely commercially accepted 
we may not be able to develop or maintain the strategic relationships necessary to provide us with the insight we need to develop commercially viable products 
we may not be able to produce commercially viable products if we are unable to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of flash memory card  pc and digital appliance manufacturers 
we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers  our oem manufacturers and our other contract manufacturers to ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner 
this collaboration is also important because our ability to anticipate trends and plan our product development activities depends to a significant degree upon our continued access to information derived from these strategic relationships 
we currently rely on strategic relationships with flash memory card manufacturers  such as sandisk  sony and toshiba  pc manufacturers  such as apple  and consumer product oems  such as olympus and fujifilm 
if we cannot maintain our relationship with these manufacturers  we may not be able to continue to develop products that are compatible with their flash memory cards  pcs and digital appliances 
however  collaboration is more difficult because many of these companies are located overseas 
if any of our current relationships deteriorates or is terminated  or if we are unable to enter into future alliances that provide us with comparable insight into market trends  we will be hindered in our ability to produce commercially viable products 
we may not be able to sustain our relationship with apple computer which would greatly hinder our ability to timely develop products which are compatible with macintosh operating systems 
historically  apple has provided us  as an apple developer  access to selected product road maps  which has allowed us to timely develop and engineer many of our current products  including our current firewire and usb storage products 
as a result of this collaborative relationship  we have received a substantial portion of our historical revenue from direct sales to apple users 
moreover  we anticipate that a significant portion of our product revenue will continue to be derived from sales of our apple compatible products in the near future 
if there was a material deterioration of our relationship with apple  we would not be able to timely develop new technologies that are compatible with apple s product road maps and this would have an adverse effect on our business 
moreover  we currently sell a number of our apple products through the apple web store  where our products may be sold separately or may be configured and ordered along with a macintosh computer 
while we do not anticipate any change in this arrangement  apple is not contractually obligated to offer our products on their website 
a decline in the demand for apple products would further reduce the market for many of our products 
our growth depends to a large extent on both our strategic relationship with apple and demand for apple products 
this dependence is due primarily to the fact that  to date  apple has been the principal pc manufacturer using the firewire interface technology on which many of our products are based 
if a decline in the demand for apple products occurs or if apple suffers a material change in its business  the market for many of our products would be negatively impacted 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly and may fluctuate significantly in the future  which could lead to decreases in our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
if our future operating results materially fluctuate or are below the expectations of stock market analysts  our stock price would likely decline 
future fluctuations may result from a variety of factors including the following the timing and amount of orders we receive from our customers  which may be tied to seasonal demand for the consumer products manufactured and sold by oems  cancellations or delays of customer product orders  or the loss of a significant customer  reductions in consumer demand for our customers products in general  such as apple products  or for our products in particular  such as flashpath  the timing and amount of research and development expenditures  the availability of manufacturing capacity necessary to make our products  general business conditions in our markets in the united states  japan and europe  as well as general economic and political conditions  any new product introductions  or delays in product introductions  by us or our competitors  increased costs charged by our suppliers or changes in the delivery of products to us  increased competition or reductions in the average selling prices that we are able to charge  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen and british pound  against the us dollar  and changes in our product mix as well as possible seasonal demand for our products 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not a good predictor of our future performance 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology companies 
recently  the market price of our common stock  like that of many technology companies  has experienced significant fluctuations 
for instance  from october   the date of our ipo  to february   the reported last sale price for our common stock ranged from to per share 
on february   the reported last sale price of our common stock was per share 
the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors 
reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views 
the fact that we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not necessarily mean that we will do so in the future 
we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and  therefore  lose our competitive advantage 
our proprietary technology with respect to inch floppy disk drive interfaces and usb and firewire source codes is critical to our future growth 
we rely in part on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
however  the patents issued to us may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
in addition  we may not receive trademark protection for our smartdisk name 
we have filed for trademark registration of the name smartdisk  but this has not yet been granted 
we are aware of a trademark application for the name smartdisk that was filed by another company 
our application could be denied and we could be prohibited from using the smartdisk name 
in that event  we would be required to incur substantial costs to establish new name recognition 
we also claim copyright protection for some proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
however  despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and software that we regard as proprietary 
those parties may have substantially greater financial resources than we have  and we may not have the resources available to challenge their use of our proprietary technology 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  it will be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
we may face competition from intel if it decides to utilize its competing patent 
intel corporation was issued a patent in disclosing and claiming technology substantially similar to that disclosed in one of our key patents 
the intel patent was filed four years after our effective filing date  and we do not believe that the intel patent can be validly applied to any of the technology disclosed in our patent 
however  given the substantial resources available to intel  our financial condition could suffer if we engage in a dispute with intel 
our business could also be harmed if intel s patent is determined to be valid and intel or any licensee of intel decides to sue our customers or develop and commercialize products based on its patent 
infringement claims by third parties could result in costly litigation and otherwise adversely impact our business 
from time to time we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of these third parties 
these claims of infringement may result in protracted and costly litigation that could require us to pay substantial damages or have sales of our products stopped by an injunction 
infringement claims could also cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
for example  we received communications alleging that our flashpath products infringed a third party s patent rights 
we have met with this third party  a non public limited liability company  to gain a better understanding of its claim and attempted to resolve the dispute through mediation 
such mediation did not yield a resolution to the dispute and such party subsequently filed a complaint in the central district federal court of the state of california 
on november   we prevailed in moving the venue for such action from the state of california to the middle district of florida 
while we believe that we do not infringe upon this third party s patent and that such claim is wholly without merit  we cannot guarantee that the effects or outcome of this litigation will be favorable to us 
further  a complaint was filed on november  in the southern district of new york by dynacore holdings corporation and dynacore patent litigation trust alleging our infringement of said parties patent relating to local area network capabilities 
the complaint seeks an undisclosed amount of damages  injunction and recall  as well as attorney fees 
while we consider this claim  as it relates to us  to be wholly without merit  we cannot guarantee that the effects or outcome of this litigation will be favorable to us 
in addition  we license a portion of the intellectual property included in our products from third parties  which may increase our exposure to infringement actions because we rely upon those third parties for information about the origin and ownership of the licensed intellectual property 
we may also lose our license rights with respect to the intellectual property for which infringement is claimed 
further  if our customers are required to obtain a license on other than commercially reasonable terms  our business could be jeopardized 
we have indemnification obligations related to our intellectual property  which may require us to pay damages 
our arrangements with fuji photo usa  iomega  sandisk  sony  toshiba and others require us to indemnify them for any damages they may suffer if a third party claims that we are violating their intellectual property rights 
while  to date  we have not received indemnification claims  there may be future claims 
for example  fuji photo usa has been named as a co defendant in the above referenced complaint initiated in california 
we have agreed to indemnify fuji photo usa with respect to expenses or damages incurred by fuji photo usa in connection with this matter 
any indemnification claim may require us to pay substantial damages  which could negatively impact our financial condition 
any settlement or claim awarded against us as a result of the securities class action suit filed against us could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
on july   a securities class action suit was filed against us  several of our executive officers and directors  including addison m 
fischer  michael s 
battaglia and michael r 
mattingly  and the following underwriters of our initial public offering fleetboston robertson stephens  inc formerly bancboston robertson stephens  inc  hambrecht quist llc  and us bancorp piper jaffray  inc the suit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of all persons who acquired our common stock between october  and december  the complaint charges defendants with violations of sections  a and of the securities act of and section b of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder  for issuing a registration statement and prospectus that contained material misrepresentations and or omissions 
the complaint alleges that the prospectus was false and misleading because it failed to disclose i the agreements between fleetboston robertson stephens  inc  hambrecht quist llc  and us bancorp piper jaffray  inc and certain investors to provide them with significant amounts of restricted shares of our common stock in the ipo in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions  and ii the agreements between fleetboston robertson stephens  inc  hambrecht quist llc  and us bancorp piper jaffray  inc and certain customers under which the underwriters would allocate shares of our common stock in the ipo to those customers in exchange for the customers agreement to purchase shares of our common stock in the after market at pre determined prices 
the complaint seeks an undisclosed amount of damages  as well as attorney fees 
we consider this claim  as it relates to us  to be wholly without merit and we will vigorously defend against such claim 
any settlement or claim awarded against us as a result of the securities class action suit filed against us could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
during  three additional class action suits were filed against one of the underwriters in our initial public offering  fleetboston robertson stephens  inc the suits were also filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of all persons who acquired our common stock between october  and december  these complaints make similar allegations that the registration statement and prospectus violate section b of the exchange act and rule b as a result of the undisclosed agreements between fleetboston robertson stephens and certain inventors and customers 
the complaints seek an undisclosed amount of damages  as well as attorney fees 
we may have particular difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights overseas 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in some foreign countries 
because many of our products are sold and a portion of our business is conducted overseas  primarily japan and europe  our exposure to intellectual property risks may be higher 
because most of our sales are to a relatively small number of customers the loss of any of our key customers would seriously harm our business 
our business will be seriously harmed if we lose any of our significant customers  particularly apple  ingram micro or sony  or suffer a substantial reduction in or cancellation of orders from these customers 
our current distribution strategy results in sales to a limited number of customers  which account for a significant portion of our net revenue 
some of our products are sold as stand alone products by oems and  to a lesser extent  are bundled together and sold with systems manufactured by third party oems 
during the year ended december   sony  apple  and ingram micro accounted for approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  and our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we expect sales of our products to a limited number of customers to account for a significant portion of our net revenue during since we sell our products to a limited number of large customers  we expect that those customers may pressure us to make price concessions  which would reduce our future gross margins 
our reliance on sales to a limited number of large customers may expose us to pressure for price concessions 
because of this reliance and because of our dependence on oems and distributors as a significant distribution channel  we expect that they may seek price concessions from us  which would reduce our average selling prices and our gross margins 
since we do not manufacture our own products  we may be unable to reduce our manufacturing costs in response to declining average per unit selling prices 
our customers could stop purchasing our products at any time because we do not have long term purchase contracts with them 
no oem or other customer is contractually obligated to purchase products from us 
as a result  our customers are free to cancel their orders or stop ordering our products at any time 
in addition  even if we are able to demonstrate that our products are superior  oems may still choose not to bundle our products with theirs or market and distribute our products on a stand alone basis 
oems may also change their business strategies and manufacturing practices  which could cause them to purchase fewer of our products  find other sources for products we currently manufacture or manufacture these products internally 
our ability to sell our products will be limited if the oems products do not achieve market acceptance or if the oems do not adequately promote our products 
we depend upon our oem customers to market certain of our products 
failure of the oems products to achieve market acceptance  the failure of the oems to bundle our products with theirs  or any other event causing a decline in our sales to the oems could seriously harm our business 
even if consumers buy oems products  their ultimate decision to buy our products depends on oem packaging  distribution and sales efforts  which may not be sufficient to maintain or increase sales of our products 
if we cannot achieve or maintain a sufficient consumer acceptance rate of our products concurrent with their purchases of oem products  our future sales to oem customers will be adversely affected 
a new or competing data transfer solution that achieves significant market share or receives significant support from manufacturers would jeopardize our business 
our products currently compete with a number of cable and non cable interfaces between personal computers and digital appliances  including ports  pcmcia slots and infrared interfaces  all of which are pc peripheral interfaces 
it is possible that one of these competing data transfer solutions  or another existing or new technology  could achieve a significant market presence or become supported by a number of significant flash memory card  personal storage or digital appliance manufacturers 
regardless of the relative benefits of our products  if a competing product gains significant market share or significant support of flash card manufacturers  this product would likely emerge as the industry standard and thereby achieve a dominant market position that would jeopardize our survival 
we expect to continue outsourcing key operational functions and our ability to do so will be impaired if we are unable to maintain our strategic relationships 
we have formed strategic relationships with a number of significant industry participants  including apple  fujifilm  hitachi  mitsumi  olympus  sony  toshiba and yamaichi 
we depend upon these corporations to provide technical assistance and perform key manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other functions 
for example  yamaichi and mitsumi currently manufacture some of our products  toshiba and apple provide technological assistance in the development of our products and sony and olympus market certain of our products 
we expect that these and similar types of relationships will be critical to our business because we intend to continue outsourcing many key operational functions and we do not currently have the resources to perform these functions ourselves 
we must overcome geographic and cultural differences in order to maintain our strategic relationships 
there are inherent difficulties in developing and maintaining relationships with foreign entities 
language and cultural differences often impair relationships  and geographical distance  at times  is also an impediment 
if any of our current relationships is impaired  or if we are unable to develop additional strategic relationships in the future  our product development costs would significantly increase and our business would be materially and adversely affected 
a portion of our sales and expenses are geographically concentrated in japan  and  therefore  we could suffer from exchange rate fluctuations and economic and political difficulties 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  was attributable to sales to japanese customers  and we expect that sales to japanese customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
all of our japanese sales  as well as the related expenses  are denominated in japanese yen 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the yen and the us dollar  particularly with respect to japanese transactions denominated in a currency other than the yen  could adversely impact our financial results 
some transactions and accounts of our japanese and european subsidiary are us dollar denominated 
since the foreign subsidiaries accounting records are kept in local currency  those us dollar denominated transactions are accounted for using the local currency at the time of the transaction 
us dollar denominated accounts are remeasured at the end of the accounting period 
this remeasurement results in adjustments to income 
in addition  the balance sheet accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to the us dollar for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the japanese yen and the british pound may deteriorate against the dollar  which would impair the value of stockholders investment in us 
fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen and the british pound against the dollar have occurred in the year ended december   resulting in a foreign currency gain of approximately million 
in addition  these fluctuations resulted in a foreign currency translation adjustment to reduce stockholders equity by approximately million as of december  further  we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exposure 
in the future  we could be required to denominate our product sales in other currencies  which would make the management of currency fluctuations more difficult and expose us to greater currency risks 
we depend on a limited number of contract and offshore manufacturers  and it may be difficult to find replacement manufacturers if our existing relationships are impaired 
we contract with offshore manufacturers to produce some of our products and our dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers exposes us to a variety of risks  including shortages of manufacturing capacity  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  production yield and costs 
for example  yamaichi and mitsumi are the sole manufacturers of our flashpath products and jess link is the sole manufacturer of our hard drive products 
if yamaichi  mitsumi or jess link terminates production  or cannot meet our production requirements  we may have to rely on other contract manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new contract manufacturers 
the lead time required to qualify a new manufacturer could range from three to six months 
despite efforts to do so  we may not be able to identify or qualify new contract manufacturers in a timely manner and these new manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements 
any significant delay in our ability to obtain adequate quantities of our products from our current or alternative contract manufacturers would cause our sales to decline 
our dependence on foreign manufacturing and international sales exposes us to difficulties often not encountered by exclusively domestic companies 
many of our products are manufactured overseas and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from overseas sales 
approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  was derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily in japan 
our dependence on foreign manufacturers and international sales poses a number of risks  including difficulties in monitoring production  transportation delays and interruptions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  currency exchange risks  tariffs and other trade barriers  including import and export restrictions  difficulties in staffing and managing disparate branch operations  political or economic instability  compliance with foreign laws  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in foreign countries  exchange controls  and potential adverse tax consequences  including with respect to repatriation of earnings 
we intend to continue manufacturing our products overseas and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
therefore  we expect to be subject to the risks outlined above for the foreseeable future 
we have a limited number of suppliers of key components and our ability to produce finished products will be impaired if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of some components 
rohm is our sole provider of application specific integrated circuits  or asics  for our flashpath products 
in our flashpath products  the specific function of these integrated circuits is the conversion of digital and analog data 
in addition  lsi logic and texas instruments are our primary suppliers of asics for our firewire products 
our dependence on a limited number of suppliers and our lack of long term supply contracts exposes us to several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components  price increases  late deliveries and poor component quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of components could delay shipments of our products 
the lead time required for orders of some of our components is as much as six months 
in addition  the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for our components is as much as months 
if we are unable to accurately predict our component needs  or if our component supply is disrupted  we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our products 
this may damage our relationships with current and prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and increased competition could harm sales of our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  purchasing and other resources than we do 
as a result  some of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards or to changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  and may be able to deliver competitive products at a lower end user price 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
therefore  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our business may suffer if we are unable to manage our growth 
failure to effectively manage our growth could impair our ability to execute our business strategy 
our business has grown substantially in recent periods  with revenue increasing from approximately million in to approximately million in the growth of our business has placed a strain on our management  operations and financial systems 
in addition  the number of employees has increased from at january  to as of december  we expect to continue to increase the number of employees if our business grows  and we may expand operations to locations other than those in which we currently operate 
continued growth  should it occur  is likely to place a greater burden on our operating and financial systems as well as our senior management and other personnel 
existing and new members of management may not be able to improve existing systems and controls or implement new systems and controls in response to anticipated growth 
management of our operations in diverse locations may also complicate the task of managing our growth 
we may not be able to integrate the business of companies we acquire and therefore these acquisitions may not provide additional value to our stockholders 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies 
we acquired vst in march and impleo in april we may not realize the desired benefits of these transactions or of future transactions 
in order to successfully integrate acquired companies we must  among other things continue to attract and retain key management and other personnel  integrate the acquired products from both an engineering and sales and marketing prospective  establish a common corporate culture  and integrate geographically distant facilities  systems and employees 
if our management s attention to day to day operations is diverted to integrating acquired companies or if problems in the integration process arise  our business could be adversely affected and we could be required to use a significant portion of our available cash 
if an acquisition is made utilizing our securities  a significant dilution to our stockholders and significant acquisition related charges to earnings could occur 
we may incur additional charges in the future resulting from redundancies in product lines  personnel and fixed assets associated with these acquisitions 
for instance  on may   we announced our intention to close our acton  massachusetts facility and move those operations into our naples  florida headquarters 
this closing allowed us to centralize our operations and marketing and development efforts  improve operational efficiencies and otherwise increase the effectiveness of our business 
in connection with this closing  we recognized approximately million in severance costs in the quarter ended june  the closing was substantially complete as of september  as a result  we incurred additional costs of approximately million during the quarter ended september  associated with employee separation costs  excess facility costs and the disposal of fixed assets 
acquisitions may also cause us to incur or assume additional liabilities or indebtedness  including liabilities that are unknown or not fully known to us at the time of the acquisition  which could have an adverse effect on us 
furthermore  we cannot assure that any products we acquire in connection with any acquisition will gain acceptance in our markets 
we could be held liable for product defects  which could require us to pay substantial damages and harm our reputation with our customers 
complex products such as ours can contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could hinder market acceptance of our products  which could damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
errors  defects or bugs could also cause interruption  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers  and could subject us to warranty claims from our customers 
we would have to expend significant capital and resources to remedy these problems 
errors  defects or bugs could be discovered in our new products after we begin commercial production of them  despite testing by us and our suppliers and customers 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business  and these officers and personnel may not remain with us in the future 
we depend upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales and product development personnel 
the loss of any of those personnel could seriously harm us 
although some of our officers are subject to employment agreements  we cannot be sure that we will retain their services 
in addition  we have not obtained key person life insurance on any of our executive officers or key employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our invested funds while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including us government and government agency notes  corporate bonds and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
during the year  our investment portfolio includes marketable securities with contractual maturities of less than one year and active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as of december   we did not hold amounts of cash equivalents and short term investments that were subject to market risk 
we do not currently hold or issue derivative securities  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct operations and sell products in several different countries 
some balance sheet accounts of our us  japanese and european operations are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency and are remeasured to the respective local currency at the end of the accounting period 
this remeasurement results in an adjustment to income 
additionally  the balance sheet accounts of our japanese and european operations are translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the respective local currency may strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  which would impact the value of stockholders investment in our common stock 
fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen and the british pound against the us dollar have occurred in  resulting in a realized foreign currency gain of approximately million 
in addition  such fluctuations resulted in an accumulated unrealized foreign currency translation loss of approximately million as of december   which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income and shown in the equity section of our balance sheet 
while most of the transactions of our us  japanese and european operations are denominated in the respective local currency  some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
our operating results may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the japanese yen and the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
most of the revenue and expense items of our japanese and european subsidiaries are denominated in the respective local currency 
in both regions  we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
for example  a decrease in the japanese yen to us dollar of percent would have resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately million and an increase in the net loss before income tax of approximately million 
further  a decrease in the british pound to us dollar of percent would have resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately million and a decrease in the net loss before income tax of approximately million 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure  however  we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we have not incurred significant realized losses on exchange transactions 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses 
intangible asset risk 
although at december  we believe our intangible assets are recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their consequent effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
