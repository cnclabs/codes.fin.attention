item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the overall decrease was primarily due to a decrease in network infrastructure sales as a result of the difficulty experienced by wireless carriers and supporting companies in financing their infrastructure needs and growth plans 
revenues from network infrastructure and mobile devices and accessories decreased  while revenues from test and maintenance products increased 
network infrastructure  mobile devices and accessories and test and maintenance products and services accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenue  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
revenue increases in the dealers and resellers and international user categories were offset by decreases in systems operators and consumer categories 
the largest increase was experienced in the dealers and resellers category  while the largest decrease was in the systems operator category 
systems operators  dealers and resellers  consumers and international users accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of fiscal revenues  as compared to   and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is due to the decrease in revenues 
the gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a significant increase in sales for test and maintenance products combined with a decrease in sales of network infrastructure products 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market  and as a result  write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal  from in fiscal this relatively nominal overall increase occurred notwithstanding substantial increases in some specific items or categories of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with and incurred in an effort to drive future growth 
these include investments in sales and marketing personnel  facility improvements and expansion and depreciation and amortization charges relative to information system enhancements 
the increases in these items or categories of expenses were  however  largely offset by significant decreases in fulfillment costs and corporate support categories  including shipping charges  off site storage facility costs  bad debt expenses and recruiting and professional services expenses 
we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve  based on this evaluation 
we also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such prospects based on this evaluation 
accordingly  we recorded a provision for bad debts of  and  for the years ended march  and april   respectively 
as a result of the factors described above  income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the operating income margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest and other expense decreased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is due to decreased levels of borrowing under our revolving credit facility and lower interest rates 
income before the provision for income taxes decreased million or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
the effective tax rates in fiscal and were and  respectively 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased and  respectively  compared to fiscal as described in further detail below  our fiscal financial performance  as measured by revenue and earnings per share growth  was strong for the first nine months  but weakened during the fourth quarter of fiscal this trend continued during the first quarter of fiscal  when revenues declined compared to the prior year s first quarter and earnings per share was 
during the second and third quarters of fiscal  we experienced sequential growth in revenues and earnings per share 
earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal were essentially flat compared to the third quarter 
this occurred even though revenue declined sequentially  because our gross margin percentage increased and operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal capital markets continue to be tight  and therefore  a number of our customers  particularly those involved in building out new or expanding or improving existing cellular or broadband systems  are experiencing difficulty in obtaining consistent and continuing access to capital to finance their growth  and correspondingly  to finance the purchase of our products 
this difficulty affects primarily our infrastructure product category 
notwithstanding this difficulty  we experienced only a modest decline in revenues for the fiscal year 
this occurred in part because of strong demand for mobile devices and accessories and replacement parts and because of strong sales of test and maintenance products  as wireless infrastructures continue to age 
our modest revenue decline in this difficult environment demonstrates  we believe  several important items the strength of our business model  the advantage of our diverse product and solutions offering  that we have made progress toward our ongoing goal of increasing market share  and that tessco is well positioned in a difficult market 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the overall increase was primarily a result of increased unit volume due to strong market demand 
revenues from all of our product lines increased 
the largest percentage increase was experienced in the sale of test and maintenance products 
network infrastructure  mobile devices and accessory and test and maintenance products and services accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenue  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
revenue increases in the systems operators  dealers and resellers and consumer categories were partially offset by a decrease in the international category 
the largest increase was experienced in the dealers and resellers category

gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was attributable to changes in product mix and increases in inventory write offs and write downs 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market  and as a result  write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increased investment in personnel and order fulfillment expense to support revenue  gross profit and order volume growth  as well as increases in depreciation and amortization related to information systems enhancements and increased bad debt expense due to several customer liquidity issues 
we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve  based on this evaluation 
accordingly  we recorded a provision for bad debts of  and  for the years ended april  and march   respectively 
as a result of the factors described above  income from operations increased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the operating income margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest and other expense increased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is due to increased levels of borrowing under our revolving credit facility to finance capital expenditures  higher interest rates and higher credit card fees resulting from an increased number of credit card payments received from customers 
income before the provision for income taxes decreased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
the effective tax rate in fiscal and was 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased and  respectively  compared to fiscal at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  year to date revenues and earnings per share were up and  respectively  over the comparable periods of fiscal then  after seven consecutive quarters of record revenues and gross profits  our fourth quarter fiscal performance was hindered by general economic conditions and a tightening of the capital markets 
these factors combined to inhibit the ability of some of our customers and potential customers to finance their growth plans 
as a consequence  for the fiscal year  revenues increased only as compared to fiscal  and net income and diluted earnings per share decreased from million and to million and  respectively 
during fiscal  many of our customers began to struggle under the weight of excess inventories and supply chain costs 
we believed  and continue to believe  that our business model particularly our ability to provide customers with real time product availability will assist our customers by helping them to better deploy capital to revenue generation projects as opposed to inventory ownership 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to million as of march   from million as of april  shareholders equity increased to million as of march   from million as of april  we generated million of net cash from operating activities in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of a large increase in trade accounts payable  partially offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal  primarily related to the purchase of the reno facility and investments in information technology  compared to million in fiscal we used million of net cash from financing activities in fiscal compared to net proceeds of million in fiscal in fiscal  our revolving line of credit balance decreased from million at april   to million at march  our revolving credit facility with a bank provides for a maximum borrowing capacity of million and has a term expiring in september this agreement contains certain conditions  covenants and representations  all of which were complied with as of march  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  slow moving inventory  income taxes  property and equipment and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue when product is shipped to the customer or when services are provided 
other than subscriber accessory sales relating to our private brand  wireless solutions  we offer no product warranties in excess of original equipment manufacturers warranties 
warranty expense is estimated and accrued at the time of sale 
warranty expense was immaterial for the fiscal years  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make their payments  additional allowances may be required 
excess and slow moving inventory 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market  and as a result  write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operational performance and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results

it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment on a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security and a forecasted transaction

fas no 
addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  fas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
fas no 
also establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the adoption of fas no 
will result in the company s discontinuation of amortization of its goodwill  however  the company will be required to test its goodwill for impairment under the new standard  which could have an adverse effect on the company s future results of operations if an impairment occurs 
the company has completed its initial evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets and does not anticipate any immediate material adverse affect of this pronouncement on its financial statements 
during fiscal year  the company incurred goodwill amortization of  which approximates the amount that would have been expensed for fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 this amount will not be expensed in fiscal year as of march   the company had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization of  in august  fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes fas no 
and abp opinion no 
this statement retains the fundamental provisions of statement that requires testing of long lived assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows  however  the statement eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to these long lived assets 
the statement also requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by a sale must be recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less the cost to sell the asset and depreciation should cease to be recorded on such assets 
any loss resulting from the write down of the assets will be recognized in income from continuing operations 
additionally  long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale may no longer be classified as discontinued until they are disposed of 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will apply this guidance prospectively
