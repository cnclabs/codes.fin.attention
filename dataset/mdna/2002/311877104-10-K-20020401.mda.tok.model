cybertech has deployed wireless networks in rochester  syracuse  albany and buffalo  new york 
as a result of this acquisition  we believe we will be able to offer our customers in the new york region the full suite of products and services offered to customers in our pennsylvania and new jersey markets 
we will also utilize cybertech s network deployment knowledge to build out wireless networks in selected existing fastnet markets 
in september and november  the company sold a total of  shares of series a preferred stock to two investors 
the shares were sold for per share and the sale included warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the million raised from this sale will be used for general corporate purposes  as well as to aid the company in its plans to grow through selected acquisitions

this is a region with a high density of enterprise customers which represents the focus of fastnet s strategic business plan 
the initial integration of supernet was completed by the end of february fastnet expects that it will be able to leverage the name recognition and customer satisfaction that supernet developed to increase sales to supernet s existing customer base  as well as providing a springboard for fastnet s further penetration of this region 
as of december   we provided internet access and enhanced services to  enterprise customers   soho customers  and  customers using our shared and dedicated web hosting  and colocation services 
our history of operating losses we have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception and expect our losses to continue through december  as we seek to execute our revised business plan 
our operating losses were   and   for the years ended december   and  respectively 
modification of our strategic plan in october of on october   we modified our strategic plan 
this modified plan called for the suspension of selling and marketing efforts in of the markets that were operational as of september  under this modified plan our selling and marketing strategy is focused on markets located in pennsylvania  new jersey and new york 
the company also changed its sales model to a consultative  face to face approach rather than the centralized telemarketing approach we previously utilized 
we believe our increased focus on a smaller number of markets which are located closer to our headquarters  in conjunction with the consultative sales approach  will enable us to engage more customers in our target markets and retain customers for longer periods of time 
we are also building a customer centric culture highlighted by dedicated customer care and technical support departments 
we expect this increased focus on customer care will help us build and maintain long term relationships with our customers 
we modified our value proposition from being a low cost provider to focusing on building a reputation of being an authority on internet enabled solutions with exceptional customer care 
our modified plan included taking the steps during to redesign our network architecture  thereby accomplishing an overall reduction in telecommunication expenses 
in october of  we began eliminating the outbound bandwidth in the markets where field sales efforts were suspended 
the market based infrastructure in the remaining operational markets was reconfigured to reduce costs while still achieving reliability and redundancy of the network by maintaining multiple connections to the worldwide internet backbone providers 
these changes had a favorable impact on our gross margins during as part of the restructuring plan  employees were terminated on october  throughout all departments of the company 
this payroll and related expense reduction resulted in reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses  thereby reducing the company s cash burn rate 
in addition to these cost containment actions  we reduced the planned capital expenditures for and we believe that the equipment that would have been deployed in new markets will provide the company with much of the networking equipment it will need into as a result of our modified strategic plan  we believe that the cash and investments we have available will be sufficient to fund operations into without requiring us to raise any additional cash 
simultaneous with the modification of our strategic plan in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million primarily related to network and telecommunication optimization and cost reduction  facility exit costs  realigned marketing strategy  and involuntary employee terminations see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  based upon a review of the company s long lived assets  the company recorded a non cash charge of million primarily related to the write down of a portion of the asset values of the components of several of the company s customer network facilities 
the company idled operations in these facilities upon adoption of the company s revised business plan 
an impairment was recognized as the future undiscounted cash flows of each facility were estimated to be insufficient to recover their related carrying values 
as such  the carrying values of these assets were written down to the company s estimates of their fair value 
throughout  the company has continually reviewed the reserves that were established in october as part of its restructuring plan 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an additional million restructuring charge related to its excess and idle data centers and administrative offices 
this charge assumes certain assumptions regarding the company s ability to sublet or dispose of these facilities 
this decision was made in the fourth quarter of as we experienced significant difficulties in attempting to dispose of or sublet these facilities due to an overall slowdown in the economy and  in particular  the commercial real estate market 
we are continuing our efforts to dispose of or sublet these facilities 
the total amount of lease payments relating to these excess or idle facilities is approximately million through actual results could differ materially for this estimate 
the activity in the restructuring charge accrual during is summarized in the table below accrued accrued restructuring cash restructuring as of payments as of december  restructuring during december  charge telecommunications exit and termination fees    leasehold termination costs    termination payments to employees sales and marketing contract terminations    facility exit costs     results of operations revenues we classify our revenue into these major categories revenues from the sale of enterprise level internet access and enhanced products and services  soho internet access which includes revenues from the sale of internet access to sohos and includes revenue from the sale of wholesale dialup access to customers that use our dialplex virtual private network vpn or wholesale internet access services to provide service to their subscribers  revenue from hosting services which includes shared web hosting services  dedicated hosting services and colocation services and finally revenues from e solutions  web design and development services 
we target our internet access and enhanced services to businesses located within our active markets 
fastnet offers a broad range of dedicated access solutions including t  t  frame relay  smds  enterprise class dsl services and fixed broadband wireless 
our enhanced services are complementary to dedicated internet access and include total managed security and the sale of third party hardware and software 
our business plan focuses on the core service offering of internet access coupled with add on sales of enhanced products and services as our customers internet needs expand 
internet access and enhanced product revenues are recognized as services are provided 
we expect our internet access and enhanced product revenues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues as we continue to focus additional resources on marketing and promoting these services 
the market for data and related services is becoming increasingly competitive 
we seek to continue to expand our customer base by both increasing market penetration in our existing markets and by increasing average revenue per customer by selling additional enhanced products and services 
we have had a historically low churn rate with our dedicated internet customers 
we believe as the industry consolidates that we will have opportunities to migrate customers from our competitors as their customers become dissatisfied with the level of service provided by the consolidated organizations 
in addition  the recent economic challenges have caused other providers to either cease operations or terminate certain product offerings 
we seek to grow our revenues by capturing market share from other providers 
our soho revenues consist of dial up internet access to both residential and small office business customers  and revenue from the sale of wholesale dialup access to customers that use our dialplex virtual private network vpn or wholesale internet access services to provide service to their subscribers  soho dsl internet access  and isdn internet access 
customers using our soho services generally sign service contracts for one to two years 
we typically bill these services in advance of providing services 
as a result  revenues are deferred until such time as services are rendered 
in the future as we execute our business plan  we expect soho revenues to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
we have reduced selling and marketing efforts targeted to this customer base in response to increased competition from both free internet service providers and other providers 
we also offer our customers virtual private network solutions 
vpn s allow business customers secure  remote access to their internal networks through a connection to fastnet s network 
the cost of these services varies with the scope of the services provided 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of our internet connectivity charges and network charges 
these are our costs of directly connecting to multiple internet backbones and maintaining our network 
cost of revenues also includes engineering payroll  creative and programming staff payrolls for web design and development  the cost of third party hardware and software that we sell to our customers  facility rental expense for network infrastructure  and rental expense on network equipment financed under operating leases 
the following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  revenues operating expenses cost of revenues excluding depreciation selling  general and administrative excluding depreciation depreciation and amortization restructuring charge asset impairment operating loss other income expense  net loss before extraordinary item extraordinary gain net loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues is primarily a result of an increase in business customers using our dedicated internet access 
our dedicated internet access customer base grew by from as of december  to  as of december  colocation revenues also contributed to the overall increase in revenues 
colocation revenues increased by  or from  in to  in as a result of our increased focus on this customer base and our new colocation facilities opened in december revenues also increased due to the acquisitions of cybertech in march and netreach in november our revenue growth was offset by the loss of microsoft webtv 
the revenues from microsoft webtv declined by million for the year ended december  our contract with microsoft s webtv was terminated in september our revenue growth was also offset by a decrease in the average revenue per customer in as a result of additional enterprise dsl customers and wireless access customers 
as we move into  we expect future revenue growth to primarily be generated from our dedicated internet access and enhanced products and services and have made growing this customer base the continued focus of our strategic business plan 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease in cost of revenues and the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to the reduction in the size and improvement in the efficiency of our network along with the reduced pricing on network elements 
the decision to discontinue service to microsoft s webtv also contributed to the reduction in the cost of revenues and the increase in gross margin 
additionally  the company reflected credits resulting from telecommunication providers billing errors and service level disputes of  during the year ended december  if these credits had not been included  gross margin would have been 
offsetting the decrease in cost of revenues  was the additional cost of revenues associated with the acquisitions of cybertech and netreach 
the cost structure of our network is scalable  therefore we believe that we will be able to continue to add revenue in without having to add significantly more network capacity  thus allowing us to continue to generate gross margin of approximately 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to reduction in head count of selling  general and administrative personnel from at december  to at december  we also reduced the company s selling  marketing and advertising expenditures from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from the reduction of advertising expenses and sales personnel in markets where we discontinued our direct sales efforts 
the remaining decline in selling  general and administrative expenses relates to the company s general cost containment efforts in the year ended december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase relates to additional depreciation related to networking equipment acquired during and and the additional depreciation on assets acquired from cybertech and netreach 
additionally  amortization expense increased due to the cybertech and netreach acquisitions

we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the year ended december  related to our excess and idle data centers and administrative offices see note to consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
interest income decreased by million or from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease in interest income resulted from the sale of our investments to fund operations during and lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased by  or from million for year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease was a result of the early extinguishment of million of capital lease obligations in the year ended december  we expect interest expense to decrease throughout as a result of the significant decrease in our capital lease obligations 
extraordinary gain 
a gain on the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million was recorded in the year ended december  as a result of the settlements of approximately million of capital lease obligations with two equipment vendors 
no taxes have been recorded on the extraordinary gain as the company provides for a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets see note to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues was primarily a result of an increase in business customers using our dedicated internet access and web hosting services 
our dedicated internet access customer base grew by from as of december  to as of december  partially offsetting this increase in customers was a decrease in the average revenue per customer during as compared to this was the result of the addition of enterprise dsl customers into our dedicated internet access customer base 
for the year ended december   we derived million or of our revenues from microsoft s webtv networks inc  as compared to million or of our revenues for the year ended december  during  we began offering our dialplex network coverage in additional markets that resulted in increased revenue from webtv 
however  in september  we reduced the price we charge webtv for our wholesale dialplex services 
our contract with microsoft s webtv networks inc terminated in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increases in our network coverage areas  as well as increases in the capacity of our network including capacity we suspended in october of during  we added additional connectivity at our network operations center 
gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin was a result of installation of telecommunication circuits in new markets before we generated any revenues in those new markets and an increase in engineering personnel 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced network costs by re designing the network to take advantage of cost saving opportunities while providing greater capacity than was previously available 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in selling  general and administrative personnel from at december  to a high of at september  as a result of the restructuring  selling  general and administrative personnel decreased to at december  also contributing to this increase was marketing and advertising expense incurred to gain brand awareness in markets 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our marketing approach to targeted direct advertising in an effort to reduce expenses 
in addition  the reduction in operational markets from as of september  to eight at december  resulted in lower selling  general  and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was comprised of depreciation on the market based network facilities and networking equipment located in those facilities 
also contributing to the increase was million of amortization expense for the year ended december  that related to the intangible assets recorded in the purchase accounting of internet unlimited as compared to the  of amortization expense recorded during the last six months of restructuring charge

asset impairment 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of million for the year ended december  related to the write down of a portion of the asset values of the components of several of the company s customer network facilities see note to consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
interest income increased by million from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in interest income was generated from the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering on february  interest expense increased by  from  for year ended december  to million for the year ended december   as we financed equipment needed for our market expansion under capital lease arrangements 
cash flows analysis year ended december  other financial data cash flows used in operating activities    cash flows provided by used in investing activities    cash flows provided by financing activities 
   net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows used in operating activities decreased by million from cash used of million in the year ended december  to cash used of million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in our net loss from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and the extraordinary gain on the extinguishment of capital lease obligations that was recorded in the year ended december  cash flows provided by investing activities increased million from cash used of million in the year ended december  to cash provided by investing activities of million in the year ended december  this increase in cash flows is a result of the company s sale of investments in to fund operations and a decrease in the purchases of property and equipment 
the company believes it will need to continue to sell investments to fund operations 
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by million from cash provided of million during the year ended december  to million of cash provided in the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows from financing activities relates to the proceeds received in from our initial public offering and exercise of the underwriters over allotment partially offset by the repayments of capital lease and debt obligations in in  the company received proceeds of million from sale of its series a preferred stock and million from term debt proceeds 
these proceeds were offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations 
liquidity and capital resources the business plan we implemented at the time of our initial public offering in february required substantial capital to fund operations  capital expenditures  expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  and acquisitions 
we modified our business strategy in october see recent developments to allow us to maintain operations without any or limited additional funding into simultaneous with the modification of our strategic plan  we recorded a non recurring charge primarily related to network and telecommunication optimization and cost reduction  facility exit costs  realigned marketing strategy  and involuntary employee terminations 
in december of the company recorded an additional charge for facility exit costs 
we expect these actions will continue to reduce our cash consumption rate in the future  but may result in early termination payments for certain contractual obligations that exist 
as of december   we had million in cash and marketable securities 
of these balances we were obligated to pay amounts totaling  in the first two weeks of january as a result of various contract settlements 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we have available after the payments in january will be sufficient to fund operations into during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge for  of this restructuring charge   has not been paid as of december  and is  accordingly  classified as accrued restructuring 
the company anticipates that the remaining accrued amount will be paid in the restructuring charges were determined based on formal plans approved by the company s management and board of directors using the information available at the time 
management of the company believes this provision will be adequate to cover any future costs incurred relating to the restructuring 
throughout  the company continually reviewed the reserves that were established in october as part of its restructuring plan 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an additional million restructuring charge related to its excess and idle data centers and administrative offices 
the amount of the charge was determined using assumptions regarding the company s ability to sublet or dispose of these facilities 
this decision was made in the fourth quarter of as we experienced significant difficulties in attempting to dispose of or sublet these facilities due to an overall slowdown in the economy and  in particular  the commercial real estate market 
we are continuing our efforts to dispose of or sublet these facilities 
the total amount of lease payments relating to these excess or idle facilities is approximately million through actual results could differ materially from this estimate 
prior to our initial public offering  we satisfied our cash requirements primarily through debt and equity financings 
on september  and november   we sold  and  shares of series a preferred stock  respectively to several investors for gross proceeds of million 
on december   the company entered into a secured loan agreement with a bank and issued the bank a note payable for million 
we entered into this loan agreement to fund our capital lease obligations settlement of million 
the term of the note is months and the note bears interest at libor plus 
the loan agreement requires that the company maintain a minimum cash balance of million and that the company will not assume or become liable for any additional indebtedness  whether contingent or direct  in excess of  provided  however  in connection with acquisitions  the company may incur indebtedness in excess of  as collateral for the loan  the company has granted the lender a security interest in essentially all of the assets of the company 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  risks from competition  new products and technological changes  price and margin pressures and dependence on key personnel 
if additional financing is needed  the company may seek to raise funds through the sale of securities  bank borrowings or otherwise 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company  if at all 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements into contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth the company s approximate aggregate obligations at december   for future payments under contracts and other contingent commitments  for the years and beyond

critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model

in november  the company issued  shares of series a preferred and  warrants to purchase common stock to a legal firm used by the company in exchange for  of professional services rendered

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by fasb no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
which was adopted by the company on january   provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
as the company does not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have any impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
statement no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
statement no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  statement no 
also changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
the company adopted this statement on july  the company has historically used the purchase method to account for all business combinations and the company does not believe adoption of this statement will materially impact the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets that requires that goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized 
instead  these assets will be reviewed annually for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
this statement applies to goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired prior to june  and will be adopted by the company on january  we expect that adoption of this accounting standard will have the impact of reducing the company s non cash amortization expense for goodwill and will have a material impact on the company s financial statements as the amount previously recorded for the amortization of goodwill is significant 
for the years ended december   and  the amounts of amortization expense for goodwill were approximately   and  respectively 
the required impairment tests of goodwill may result in future period write downs 
in order to complete the transitional assessment of goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets impairment  the company will need to identify the reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the company will have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
our financial instruments primarily consist of debt 
all of our debt instruments bear interest at fixed rates 
therefore  a change in interest rates would not affect the interest incurred or cash flows related to our debt 
a change in interest rates would  however  affect the fair value of the debt 
the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from levels at december  with all other factors held constant 
a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would result in a change in the value of our debt of less than  at december  because our debt is neither publicly traded nor redeemable at our option  it is unlikely that such a change would impact our financial statements or results of operations 
all of our transactions are conducted using the united states dollar 
therefore  we are not exposed to any significant market risk relating to currency rates
