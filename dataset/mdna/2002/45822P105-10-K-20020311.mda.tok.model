item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations wps resources corporation wps resources corporation is a holding company 
our wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities  wisconsin public service corporation and upper peninsula power company 
another wholly owned subsidiary  wps resources capital corporation  is a holding company for our nonregulated businesses including wps energy services  inc and wps power development  inc compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following chart wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share consolidated operating revenues increased due to sales volume growth for all business segments and higher natural gas prices in the first part of in addition  rate increases at wisconsin public service contributed to increased revenues in the public service commission of wisconsin authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january  increased profitability at our nonregulated segments offset a decrease in earnings at our electric and natural gas utility segments resulting in improved earnings in a gain on the sale of hydro lands as part of our asset management strategy  increased natural gas and electric utility margins  increased electric and natural gas margins at wps energy services  additional tax credits at wps power development and a gain on the sale of a portion of wps power development s investment in its synthetic fuel operation contributed to higher earnings 
partially offsetting these factors were increased operating expenses at all segments and a lower margin at wps power development 
overview of utility operations utility operations include the electric utility operations at wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power and the natural gas utility operations at wisconsin public service 
income from electric utility operations was million in compared with million in income from gas utility operations was million in and million in electric utility operations the consolidated electric utility margin represents electric revenue less cost of sales exclusive of intercompany transactions 
our consolidated electric utility margin increased million  or  primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase at wisconsin public service which became effective on january  electric utility results millions revenues fuel and purchased power margin sales in kilowatt hours the consolidated electric utility margin increased due to the electric rate increase at wisconsin public service and higher sales volumes to most customer classes at upper peninsula power and wisconsin public service 
summer weather was warmer in than in  and warmer than normal 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sales to large commercial and industrial customers at wisconsin public service due to declining economic conditions 
affecting the electric utility margin was a change in the customer mix at wisconsin public service 
sales to lower margin  non firm customers increased more than sales to higher margin customers 
the lack of new retail electric rates at upper peninsula power also affected the margin negatively 
upper peninsula power s application for a million rate increase which had been pending before the michigan public service commission since october was dismissed in august at upper peninsula power s request 
upper peninsula power requested a dismissal because the information filed in the case was outdated 
upper peninsula power intends to submit a new application for rate increases in our consolidated fuel expense for production plants decreased million  or  largely due to decreased production at wisconsin public service s combustion turbine generation plants 
our consolidated purchased power expense  however  increased million due to an increase in power purchases and a increase in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by wisconsin public service in compared with power purchases were higher in due to warmer summer weather and the availability of economically priced energy 
also contributing to increased power purchases were a scheduled outage at wisconsin public service s nuclear plant and an unscheduled outage at one of its fossil fueled generation plants 
wisconsin public service s kewaunee nuclear power plant was off line for a scheduled refueling and replacement of its steam generators which began in late september of the kewaunee plant returned to service in early december as scheduled 
wisconsin public service is currently a owner of the kewaunee plant 
wisconsin public service s pulliam unit was off line for unscheduled repairs in the fourth quarter of and returned to service on february  wisconsin public service chose to take advantage of purchased power during these outages because of economically favorable pricing 
the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service the opportunity to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis 
in the third quarter of  wisconsin public service submitted a fuel filing with the public service commission of wisconsin requesting a million retail electric rate reduction 
the rate reduction was approved and implemented on september  wisconsin public service submitted an additional fuel filing in november  and a rate reduction of million was approved and implemented on december  gas utility operations the consolidated gas utility margin represents natural gas revenues less purchases exclusive of intercompany transactions 
effective april   the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service includes the merged wisconsin fuel and light company operations 
wisconsin public service corporation s gas utility results millions revenues purchase costs margin throughput in therms the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service increased million  or  in this increase was due to a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january   and higher overall natural gas throughput volumes of 
increased gas throughput volumes were largely the result of wisconsin public service s acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in the second quarter of gas throughput volumes to large commercial and industrial customers  however  decreased as a result of customers switching to the gas transport customer class and declining economic conditions 
gas throughput volumes to gas transport customers increased 
in addition  gas throughput volumes to interruptible customers decreased 
gas throughput volumes were negatively affected by winter weather which was milder in than in  and milder than normal 
wisconsin public service s natural gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of an increase in the average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of  increased throughput  and the increase in wisconsin retail gas rates 
wisconsin public service s natural gas purchase costs increased million  or  largely due to a higher average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of the higher natural gas prices experienced earlier in were passed on to customers and are reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
under current regulatory practice  the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission allow wisconsin public service to pass changes in the cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause 
other utility expenses income utility operating expenses increased million largely due to increased transmission expenses associated with the transfer of assets to american transmission company  increased payments to the wisconsin department of administration for demand side management energy conservation activities  increased maintenance costs at the kewaunee plant during its refueling outage  and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts 
the public service commission of wisconsin has allowed a portion of the higher transmission costs to be deferred 
the deferred transmission costs  million for  are expected to be recovered in future regulatory proceedings 
lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund contributed to a decrease in other income from utility operations 
due to regulatory practice  lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund were offset by decreased depreciation expense 
also contributing to decreased depreciation expense were an extension in the kewaunee plant s assumed depreciable life and a reduction in the nuclear decommissioning fund contribution 
interest expense increased due to the issuance of additional long term debt by wisconsin public service in august of overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated operations consist of the natural gas  electric  and other sales at wps energy services  a diversified energy supply and services company and the operations of wps power development  an electric generation asset development company 
wps energy services net income increased to million in compared with million in wps power development s net income increased to million in compared with million in overview of wps energy services wps energy services principal business involves nonregulated gas sales 
in addition  nonregulated electric sales have become an important factor in the growth of wps energy services 
revenues at wps energy services grew to  million in compared with million in  an increase of 
this increase was the result of additional natural gas and electric sales volumes coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas in the first half of the higher unit cost of natural gas is also reflected in cost of sales  thus having little impact on margin 
income increased million in due to increased sales and improved operations 
wps energy services margins wps energy services gas results millions nonregulated natural gas revenues nonregulated natural gas cost of sales margin nonregulated gas revenues at wps energy services increased million  or  primarily as the result of sales volume growth and higher natural gas prices in the first half of the nonregulated gas margin increased million  or  due to increased sales volumes and exiting from unprofitable market segments 
wps energy services electric results millions nonregulated electric revenues nonregulated electric cost of sales margin nonregulated electric revenues at wps energy services increased million  or 
the nonregulated electric margin increased million  or 
higher electric sales volumes in existing and newly entered retail electric markets  increased electric wholesale activities  as well as impacts from marketing energy from wps power development s sunbury plant  contributed to these increases 
wps energy services other expenses other operating expenses at wps energy services increased million largely due to costs associated with business expansion and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts 
impact of enron although wps energy services is an energy marketer  it has experienced little impact on day to day operations as a result of the bankruptcy of enron corporation  and is in a net payable position with enron affiliates 
wps energy services has liquidated all open positions with the enron affiliates and replaced them with other suppliers 
the forward contracts with the enron affiliates provided for payments representing the net liquidation value of the contracts at the time of liquidation  and this net liquidation amount is reflected on the balance sheet as a current accounts payable  contingent upon the outcome of enron s bankruptcy proceedings 
management believes these liabilities are properly recorded 
the enron bankruptcy is expected to have an effect on other companies throughout the industry 
as a result  wps energy services is more closely monitoring its credit exposure with other trading partners 
overview of wps power development revenues at wps power development increased million  or  primarily due to higher revenues at its sunbury generation plant of million and higher revenues from its steam operations of million 
wps power development s income was million in compared with million in additional tax credits of approximately million from its synthetic fuel operation was the primary factor in wps power development s increased income in wps power development s margin wps power development s production results millions nonregulated other revenues nonregulated other cost of sales margin wps power development experienced a decrease of million in its margin in from the primary factors in this decrease were a million margin decrease at sunbury due to higher fuel costs as a result of purchasing coal at current market prices and higher costs of replacement power during outages 
wps power development is attempting to recover a portion of the fuel cost increase through a lawsuit which it filed against a coal supplier for failure to deliver under the terms of a coal supply agreement 
the sunbury margin decrease was partially offset by higher margins at the westwood generation plant  which was acquired in september of wps power development s other expenses income other operating expenses at wps power development increased by million in compared with  primarily due to costs associated with operations at the westwood plant  higher payroll expenses  and increased development costs for potential new projects 
other income increased million  primarily from a portion of the gain that was recognized in the sale of a partial interest in wps power development s synthetic fuel facility 
tax credits wps power development recorded synthetic fuel tax credits of million in  an increase of approximately million over we used these credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal tax liability  and the remainder increased our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years 
approximately million of tax credits where carried over from  which brings the cumulative credits being carried forward to approximately million 
alternative minimum tax credits can be used in future years to reduce our regular tax liability  subject to various limitations 
based on a review of all known facts and circumstances  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use these credits in the future to reduce our federal tax liability 
overview of holding company and other operations holding company and other operations include the operations of wps resources and wps resources capital as holding companies and the nonutility activities at wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power 
holding company and other operations experienced income of million in compared with a loss of million in other nonutility income at wisconsin public service included a pre tax gain of million on the sale of hydro lands in december of the sale of these hydro lands was the first significant transaction in our five to seven year asset management strategy to increase shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain real estate assets deemed to be no longer essential to operations 
in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to our investment in american transmission company 
interest expense increased due to additional short term borrowing at wps resources for working capital needs in the first half of compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following chart wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic and diluted earnings per share the substantial revenue growth was largely due to increased natural gas and electric sales at wps energy services and increased sales at wps power development as we acquired additional customers and expanded into new markets 
part of the increase in revenues was a result of the record high unit cost of natural gas experienced in gas cost per therm was higher in than in the high unit cost of natural gas was reflected in both revenues and cost of sales  thus having little impact on margin 
the increase in income and earnings per share was the result of higher electric and natural gas utility margins and increases in wps energy services electric and natural gas margins 
additionally  a higher margin along with additional tax credits at wps power development contributed to higher income 
partially offsetting these factors were increases in operating and interest expenses  coupled with costs associated with an electric energy contract entered into by wps resources as a hedge against potential summer energy price spikes 
overview of utility operations income from electric utility operations was million in compared with million in income from natural gas utility operations was million in and million in the primary reasons for higher utility net income were a wisconsin retail electric rate increase and increased natural gas sales volumes as the result of winter weather that was colder in than in electric utility operations our consolidated electric utility margin increased million  or  primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase at wisconsin public service which became effective on january  this rate increase was primarily intended to recover additional fuel and purchased power costs for the year 
the electric rate increase also took into account the expected gain on the sale of utility assets which is discussed under other electric and gas utility expenses income 
although our consolidated kilowatt hour sales were only slightly higher  partially due to a cooler summer in than in  consolidated revenues increased due to the wisconsin retail electric rate increase at wisconsin public service 
our consolidated fuel expense increased million  or  due to increased production at wisconsin public service s fossil fueled and combustion turbine generation plants 
in addition  the average cost of generation at the combustion turbine plants increased largely as a result of a higher unit cost of natural gas 
generation costs at the kewaunee plant decreased in due to its scheduled outage for refueling and maintenance in the second quarter of a similar outage did not occur in the kewaunee plant was off line beginning april  and returned to full power on june  during the scheduled outage  nuclear generation was replaced with additional fossil fuel and combustion turbine generation and additional purchased power 
wisconsin public service was the operator and owner of the kewaunee plant in our consolidated purchased power expense decreased million  however  largely due to a decrease in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by wisconsin public service in compared with annual fuel costs at december  were within the fuel window authorized by the public service commission of wisconsin and  accordingly  no adjustment was made to electric rates for fuel costs 
gas utility operations the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service increased million  or  in due to an increase in throughput volumes 
winter weather was a factor for wisconsin public service s natural gas operations in weather was colder in than in  however  weather was warmer than normal in wisconsin public service s natural gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of a increase in the average unit cost of natural gas coupled with a increase in overall throughput volumes 
wisconsin public service s natural gas purchase costs increased million  or 
this increase resulted from a higher average unit cost of natural gas and higher gas volumes purchased of 
the higher unit cost of natural gas was reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
other electric and gas utility expenses income utility operating expenses increased million 
electric utility operating expenses increased million primarily due to costs associated with the scheduled outage and other maintenance activities at the kewaunee plant 
higher earnings of million on the kewaunee plant s nuclear decommissioning fund resulted in increased other income at wisconsin public service in due to regulatory practices  this higher income was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expense 
other income at wisconsin public service also included a gain of million on the sale of a combustion turbine which wisconsin public service constructed for another wisconsin utility 
the public service commission of wisconsin considered this gain in the wisconsin retail electric rate adjustment which was effective january  nonregulated operations wps energy services net income improved to million in compared with a loss of million in income at wps power development also improved 
wps power development s net income was million in compared with a loss of million in overview of wps energy services revenues at wps energy services grew to million in compared with million in  an increase of 
this increase was the result of additional natural gas and electric sales volumes coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas

income increased million in due to a larger increase in electric and gas margins than in the related other operating expenses 
wps energy services margins the nonregulated gas margin at wps energy services increased million largely due to increased sales volumes 
natural gas revenues at wps energy services more than tripled in compared with this increase was due to sales volumes that doubled as the result of additional sales in the wholesale market and general business growth 
in addition  a large portion of the increase was due to a higher unit cost of natural gas in wps energy services gas cost of sales tripled due to additional natural gas purchases coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas 
electric margins at wps energy services increased million in electric revenues at wps energy services were million in and million in this increase in revenue resulted from additional electric sales in pennsylvania and maine associated with wps power development s assets that were acquired in the second and fourth quarters of electric purchases increased million due to additional sales volumes 
wps energy services other expenses other operating expenses at wps energy services increased million  or  primarily due to greater payroll and other operational costs associated with business expansion 
overview of wps power development income at wps power development was million in compared with a loss of million in the increase in income was primarily due to a higher margin on operating activities and additional tax credits 
partially offsetting these factors were higher operating and interest expenses 
tax credits at wps power development increased approximately million in we used these tax credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal income tax liability 
approximately million of these tax credits were carried forward from to reduce our tax liability in subsequent years 
a large portion of the tax credits at wps power development relate to the operations of its synthetic fuel facilities 
production at the synthetic fuel facility was higher than anticipated in  despite the physical relocation of the project from alabama to kentucky during the facility was taken out of operation in april to prepare for relocation  and wps power development began operation of the facilities in the new location on september  in addition  wps power development reversed million of previously recorded losses in the first quarter of as a result of an equity contribution to its synthetic fuel project by the minority owner 
prior to this transaction  wps power development had been recording of the operating losses of this project because the minority owner s equity had been reduced to zero  however  it had been allocated only of the tax credits 
through an agreement with the minority owner  wps power development received of the tax credits and operating results from the project until the minority owner was able to contribute further capital to fund its share of the operating costs 
wps power development s margin wps power development experienced an increase of million in its margin in this increase was largely due to the operation of the electric generation facilities acquired in maine and canada in the second quarter of and in pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of wps power development s other expenses other operating expenses at wps power development increased million in due to maintenance and higher production costs at its generation plants in pennsylvania 
costs associated with the investigation and start up of new projects at wps power development also increased in higher interest expense of million in was largely due to nonrecourse debt put in place to finance the plant acquisitions 
additional costs at the sunbury generation plant in pennsylvania lowered results at wps power development  particularly in the fourth quarter of this included higher production costs  higher maintenance costs both planned and accelerated and increased costs of replacement power while the plant was undergoing maintenance 
the decision was made to move some maintenance scheduled in future years into to coincide with other plant downtime 
the accelerated maintenance at the sunbury plant was intended to enhance availability in and future years 
overview of holding company and other operations holding company and other operations experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in the increased loss was primarily due to additional interest expense  increased operating expenses  and a cost of million for an electric energy contract entered into by wps resources in as a hedge against potential summer energy price spikes 
balance sheet wps resources corporation compared with customer and other receivables decreased million and accrued unbilled revenues decreased million as the result of milder weather and a substantially lower unit cost of natural gas experienced in december of compared with december of regulatory assets increased million as the result of deferred costs related to compliance with certain nuclear regulatory commission requirements and additional regulatory assets acquired as a result of the wisconsin fuel and light merger  largely related to future environmental remediation costs 
other assets increased million largely as a result of the investment in american transmission company  goodwill associated with the wisconsin fuel and light merger  and an increase in pension assets 
assets from risk management activities decreased million and liabilities from risk management activities decreased million largely due to changes in forward prices

 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
wps energy services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to its customers 
wps energy services also uses derivatives to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases as well as trading activities 
derivatives may include futures and forward contracts  price swap agreements  and call and put options 
accordingly under issue no 
 wps energy services marks its energy trading contracts to fair value on the balance sheet  and recognizes changes in market value in earnings 
impact of new accounting standards we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  this statement requires derivative instruments to be recorded at their fair value as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in the derivative s fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we concluded that the majority of contracts at our utility subsidiaries and at wps power development for the purchase  sale  and storage of natural gas  electricity  coal  and nuclear fuel do not meet the definition of a derivative as defined under statement no 
and  therefore  are not subject to the accounting requirements of statement no 
wisconsin public service entered into a limited number of commodity contracts that meet the definition of a derivative 
we believe that any gains or losses resulting from the settlement of these contracts will be collected from  or refunded to  retail customers 
derivative assets and liabilities that are recorded as a result of these derivative contracts are offset with corresponding regulatory assets and liabilities 
at january   wisconsin public service recorded a derivative asset and an offsetting regulatory liability of approximately million 
the cumulative effect on income was not significant 
wps energy services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold to customers at firm prices 
wps energy services also uses derivatives to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases as well as trading activities 
wps energy services concluded that its energy contracts were trading contracts and  therefore  applies emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
accordingly  wps energy services recorded its energy contracts at fair value on the balance sheet  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
because wps energy services marks its energy trading contracts to market in accordance with issue and does not anticipate designating any derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes  the adoption of statement no 
did not have a material impact at wps energy services 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  the financial statement impact of adapting standard no 
was immaterial 
in accordance with the requirements of this statement  we ceased amortizing the goodwill associated with the wisconsin fuel and light merger at january   and prepared a preliminary evaluation of the fair market value of the gas utility business segment to assess the potential impairment of the goodwill balance 
based on the estimated fair value  an impairment charge was not required 
liquidity wps resources normally uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
we may periodically issue long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
we seek non recourse financing for funding some nonregulated acquisitions 
wps resources commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses and upper peninsula power 
the specific forms of financing  amounts  and timing depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
the current credit ratings for wps resources and wisconsin public service are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wps resources corporation senior unsecured debt commercial paper trust preferred securities a a a aa p a wisconsin public service corporation bonds preferred stock commercial paper aa a a aa a p these ratings are among the best in the energy industry and have allowed us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company s credit rating 
these measures include business risk  liquidity risk  competitive position  capital mix  financial condition  predictability of cash flows  management strength  and future direction 
some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios  while the qualitative ones are more subjective 
the recapture of its operating and capital costs through ratemaking mechanisms such as the electric fuel window  purchased gas adjustment clause  and frequent rate adjustments based on projected test years have a positive impact on wisconsin public service s liquidity 
wps resources and wisconsin public service maintain separate commercial paper borrowing programs in compliance with the public service commission of wisconsin s directives 
factors affecting the commercial paper credit ratings at both wps resources and wisconsin public service include the overall credit strength for the company  the ratings on its long term debt  the amount of its short term debt  and the amount and quality of the bank facilities backing up its commercial paper borrowing 
if the company s long term debt rating were to fall below a rating of a a  the potential exists for a downgrade in its commercial paper rating 
wps resources holds credit lines to back of its commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit 
included in the credit lines of wps resources  and also of wisconsin public service  are credit lines of million and million  respectively  that require both companies to maintain a commercial paper rating of a p a decrease in ratings below that level could adversely affect the company by increasing the interest rates at which it can borrow  restricting its ability to obtain lines and letters of credit  and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the company in the commercial paper market 
a restriction in the company s ability to use commercial paper borrowing for its working capital needs could require it to secure funds through bank loans resulting in higher interest expense and delayed availability of funds 
wps energy services maintains underlying agreements to support its electric and gas trading operations 
in the event of a deterioration of wps resources credit rating  most of these agreements allow the counter party to demand additional assurance of payment 
this provision could pertain to existing business  new business  or both with the counter party 
the additional assurance requirements could be met with letters of credit  surety bonds  or cash deposits and would likely result in wps resources being required to maintain increased bank lines of credit  incur additional expenses  and could restrict the amount of business wps energy services can conduct 
wps energy services uses the nymex and over the counter financial markets to hedge its exposure to physical customer obligations 
these hedges are closely correlated to the customer contracts  but price movements on the hedge contracts may require financial backing 
certain movements in price for contracts through the nymex exchange require posting of cash deposits equal to the market move 
for the over the counter market  the underlying contract may allow the counter party to require additional collateral to cover the increased obligation 
market price changes could cause significant near term cash requirements to support the business 
increased requirements related to market price changes should only result in a temporary liquidity need that will unwind as the sales contracts are fulfilled 
wps power development has some projects which are partially funded by non recourse debt 
these debt obligations have certain debt coverage covenants related to liquidity that must be met 
factors that can impact liquidity at these projects are overall electric market conditions  the physical availability of the project to meet contractual requirements  the cost and availability of required inputs to production  and the level of operating and maintenance costs 
if any of these projects should fall below the required debt coverage levels  wps resources can either contribute additional equity or  if market conditions are such that the project is no longer considered viable  abandon the project

wps resources primarily issues the guaranties to counter parties in the wholesale electric and natural gas marketplace to meet the counter parties requirements and permit wps energy services to operate within these markets 
the authorized amount of the guaranties is in excess of the amount of obligations actually backed by the wps resources guaranties 
the amount supported is dependent on the amount of outstanding business wps energy services has with the counter parties holding the guaranties at any point in time 
wps resources reflects wps energy services obligations supported by these parental guaranties on its consolidated balance sheet either as accounts payable or liabilities from risk management activities 
the wps resources board of directors has authorized corporate guaranties as needed to support certain specific business operations of wps power development 
wps resources has issued approximately million in guaranties which are not reflected in the table above 
wps resources issues the guaranties for indemnification obligations related to business purchase agreements  borrowings  and counter parties in the wholesale electric marketplace to meet their credit requirements and permit wps power development to operate within these markets 
the authorized amount of the guaranties is in excess of the amount of obligations actually backed by wps resources guaranties 
the amount supported is dependent on the amount of the outstanding obligation that wps power development has with the parties holding the guaranties at any point in time 
the guaranties are required to support wps power development in its normal operations of energy production and the sale of electricity 
wps resources reflects wps power development s obligations supported by these parental guaranties on its consolidated balance sheets or in the footnotes to its financial statements 
since may  wps resources has provided limited financial support and energy supply services to a third party  quest energy  llc  a michigan limited liability company 
quest is a retail electricity marketing entity  doing business as a registered alternative electric supplier in the state of michigan 
financial support is in the form of an interest bearing note with an initial maturity date of may  secured by the assets of quest 
on december   the loan amount remaining was million 
the note contains certain restrictions on quest s ability to enter into additional debt instruments 
wps resources also provides corporate guaranties on behalf of quest that are not included in its consolidated financial statements 
guaranties have been made to quest s transmission providers in the amount of million 
these guaranties assure quest s ability to pay for the transmission services it purchases from these entities 
these guaranties are reflected in the table above 
wps energy services provides substantially all of the electric energy supply to quest on a wholesale basis without requiring the credit assurances required of other wholesale customers 
wps energy services exercises its right to evaluate quest s sales portfolio to verify the portfolio s ability to generate the revenues necessary to pay for purchased wholesale supply 
wps energy services further provides computational infrastructure and support services related to the daily operational activities of quest 
at year end  quest was current in its payables to wps energy services 
on occasion  however  payments from quest have been late and wps energy services imposes payment penalties on these late payments 
trading activities wps energy services measures the fair value of contracts  including nymex exchange and over the counter contracts  natural gas options  natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts  basis contracts  and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis using risk management systems 
the primary input for natural gas pricing is the settled forward price curve of the nymex exchange which includes spreads  contracts  and options 
basis pricing is derived from published indices gas daily  natural gas intelligence  and inside ferc and well documented broker quotes 
wps energy services bases electric prices on published indices and well documented broker quotes 
because the majority of the contracts have a term of less than months  the forward curves have a reasonable degree of liquidity and wps energy services does not determine any forward price curves internally 
low tolerance for price risk causes wps energy services to use financial instruments to hedge substantially all its positions and  therefore  changes in the primary variable  which is the forward price curves  has little impact on the net fair value of the contracts as marked to market 
an outside company with an established practice in energy risk evaluation verified the electric mark to market position at december  due to the large increase in new business and the introduction of new electric risk management software 
the results of its independent calculation were consistent with those generated by wps energy services

these amounts represent the mark to market gain or loss at the inception of these contracts 
there were  in many cases  offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current year 
the gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above

electric utility restructuring wisconsin electric reliability continues to be the primary issue for the public service commission of wisconsin 
industry restructuring and retail generation open access remain secondary issues in the state 
the public service commission of wisconsin is evaluating proposals regarding future construction and ownership of generation facilities in the state 
the public service commission of wisconsin authorized wisconsin electric power company to proceed with its planning for generation construction 
on february   wisconsin electric power applied for certificates of public convenience and necessity for its generation construction proposals 
this application is being reviewed  however  and further approval is required in order for wisconsin electric power to proceed 
electric utility restructuring michigan in june  a law was enacted which provides michigan retail electric customers the right to choose their generation supplier by january  wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power  along with other michigan electric and gas association members  jointly developed and filed open access tariffs and business practices with the michigan public service commission prior to january  gas utility restructuring wisconsin in its wisconsin retail rate application  wisconsin public service proposed to facilitate customer choice of natural gas suppliers through the use of its new automated meter reading system 
the proposal was approved by the public service commission of wisconsin and provided customer choice of gas suppliers for large commercial customers beginning on november  customer choice will be offered to additional commercial customers beginning on november  this program will be expanded to all customers as the automated meter reading system is installed system wide 
gas utility restructuring michigan most of michigan s largest gas customers are allowed to choose their natural gas commodity supplier 
the smaller michigan natural gas utilities  including wisconsin public service  are to propose a customer choice program for all customer classes when it is in the best interests of each utility and its customers 
wisconsin public service intends to provide customer choice to its michigan customers following the implementation of its automated meter reading system in that state 
environmental wisconsin public service estimates future undiscounted investigation and cleanup costs of former manufactured gas sites to be in the range of million to million 
we may adjust these estimates in the future contingent upon remedial technology  regulatory requirements  and the assessment of environmental damages 
wisconsin public service currently has a million liability recorded for gas plant cleanup with an offsetting regulatory asset deferred charge 
we expect to recover cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries in future customer rates 
we will not recover carrying costs associated with the cleanup expenditures 
wisconsin public service has received million in insurance recoveries which have been recorded as a reduction in the regulatory asset 
the state of wisconsin developed a nitrogen oxide reduction plan for all utilities in the ozone non attainment area established by the united states environmental protection agency in southern wisconsin 
the nitrogen oxide reductions begin in  and the requirements are gradually increased through this reduction plan affects edgewater unit wisconsin public service owns of this unit 
a compliance plan for edgewater unit was initiated in the plan includes a combination of combustion optimization and emission trading at a potential cost to wisconsin public service of approximately million 
the state of wisconsin is also seeking voluntary reductions from units outside the ozone non attainment area which may lead to additional expenditures for nitrogen oxide reductions at other units 
wisconsin public service is participating in voluntary efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide levels at the columbia energy center 
wisconsin public service owns of columbia 
the public service commission of wisconsin has approved recovery of the costs associated with nitrogen oxide compliance 
the wisconsin department of natural resources initiated a rulemaking effort aimed at the control of mercury emissions 
coal fired generation plants are the primary target of this effort 
the proposed rule was open to comment in october a final rule could be issued in the spring of as proposed  the rule requires phased in mercury emission reductions reaching reduction in years 
wisconsin public service estimates that it could cost million per year for it to achieve the reduction 
early compliance with the federal clean air act has generated surplus sulfur dioxide allowances at wisconsin public service 
wisconsin public service has sold and will continue to consider the sale of any allowances in excess of its own needs 
the public service commission of wisconsin has ordered that profits from the sale of allowances be passed on to wisconsin public service s customers 
wps power development acquired emission allowances as a result of the purchase of the sunbury plant in and the westwood plant in the costs assigned to these allowances are charged to expense as the allowances are used 
the sunbury plant also purchases incremental emission allowances on the open market to comply with air regulations 
wps power development is installing additional technology in order to comply with the nitrogen oxide standards 
expenditures for this technology could be significant 
asset management strategy in december wisconsin public service sold  acres of land on the peshtigo river in northeastern wisconsin to the wisconsin department of natural resources for million 
this sale was the first significant transaction in a five to seven year asset management strategy we adopted in the agreement with the department of natural resources includes two options  one exercisable in and the other in  whereby the department may acquire  at less than fair value  approximately  additional acres for million if both options are exercised 
the value associated with the difference between the option price and the fair value will be treated as a charitable contribution 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wisconsin public service s and upper peninsula power s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because rate forecasting assumes inflation  most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
results of operations wisconsin public service corporation wisconsin public service corporation is a regulated electric and natural gas utility 
electric operations accounted for approximately of revenues  while gas operations contributed to revenues 
compared with wisconsin public service corporation overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following chart wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock sales volume growth  rate increases  and higher natural gas prices in the first part of contributed to increased revenues 
the public service commission of wisconsin authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january  earnings from electric utility operations were million in compared with million in earnings from gas utility operations were million in and million in other nonutility income from the gain on the sale of hydro lands as part of our asset management strategy and increased utility margins contributed to higher overall earnings 
partially offsetting these factors were increased operating expenses 
electric utility operations wisconsin public service s electric utility margin increased million  or  primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase which became effective on january  electric utility results millions revenues fuel and purchased power margin sales in kilowatt hours wisconsin public service s electric utility margin increased due to the electric rate increase and higher sales volumes to most customer classes at wisconsin public service 
summer weather was warmer in than in  and warmer than normal 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sales to large commercial and industrial customers due to declining economic conditions 
also affecting the electric utility margin was a change in the customer mix 
sales to lower margin  non firm customers increased more than sales to higher margin customers 
wisconsin public service s fuel expense for production plants decreased million  or  largely due to decreased production at its combustion turbine generation plants 
wisconsin public service s purchased power expense  however  increased million due to an increase in power purchases and a increase in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made in compared with power purchases were higher in due to warmer summer weather and the availability of economically priced energy 
also contributing to increased power purchases were a scheduled outage at wisconsin public service s nuclear plant and an unscheduled outage at one of its fossil fueled generation plants 
wisconsin public service s kewaunee plant was off line for a scheduled refueling and replacement of its steam generators in late september of the kewaunee plant returned to service in early december as scheduled 
wisconsin public service is currently a owner of the kewaunee plant 
wisconsin public service s pulliam unit was off line for unscheduled repairs in the fourth quarter of and returned to service on february  wisconsin public service chose to take advantage of purchased power during these outages because of economically favorable pricing 
the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service the opportunity to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis 
in the third quarter of  wisconsin public service submitted a fuel filing with the public service commission of wisconsin requesting a million retail electric rate reduction 
the rate reduction was approved and implemented on september  wisconsin public service submitted an additional fuel filing in november  and a rate reduction of million was approved and implemented on december  gas utility operations effective april   the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service includes the merged wisconsin fuel and light company operations 
wisconsin public service corporation s gas utility results millions revenues purchase costs margin throughput in therms the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service increased million  or  in this increase was due to a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january   and higher overall natural gas throughput volumes of 
increased gas throughput volumes were largely the result of wisconsin public service s acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in the second quarter of gas throughput volumes to large commercial and industrial customers  however  decreased as a result of customers switching to the gas transport customer class and declining economic conditions 
gas throughput volumes to gas transport customers increased 
in addition  gas throughput volumes to interruptible customers decreased 
gas throughput volumes were negatively affected by winter weather which was milder in than in  and milder than normal 
wisconsin public service s natural gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of an increase in the average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of  increased throughput  and the increase in wisconsin retail gas rates 
wisconsin public service s natural gas purchase costs increased million  or  largely due to a higher average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of the higher natural gas prices experienced earlier in were passed on to customers and are reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
under current regulatory practice  the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission allow wisconsin public service to pass changes in the cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause 
other utility expenses income utility operating expenses increased million largely due to increased transmission expenses associated with the transfer of assets to american transmission company  increased payments to the wisconsin department of administration for demand side management energy conservation activities  increased maintenance costs at the kewaunee plant during its refueling outage  and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts 
the public service commission of wisconsin has allowed a portion of the higher transmission costs to be deferred 
the deferred transmission costs  million for  are expected to be recovered in future regulatory proceedings 
lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund contributed to a decrease in other income from utility operations 
due to regulatory practice  lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund were offset by decreased depreciation expense 
also contributing to decreased depreciation expense were an extension in the kewaunee plant s assumed depreciable life and a reduction in the nuclear decommissioning fund contribution 
interest expense increased due to the issuance of additional long term debt by wisconsin public service in august of other nonutility income other nonutility income at wisconsin public service included a pre tax gain of million on the sale of hydro lands in december of the sale of these hydro lands was the first significant transaction in our five to seven year asset management strategy to increase shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain real estate assets deemed to be no longer essential to operations 
in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to our investment in american transmission company 
compared with overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following chart wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock earnings from electric utility operations were million in compared with million in earnings from natural gas utility operations were million in and million in the primary reasons for higher utility earnings were a wisconsin retail electric rate increase and increased natural gas sales volumes as the result of winter weather that was colder in than in electric utility operations wisconsin public service s electric utility margin increased million  or  primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase which became effective on january  this rate increase was primarily intended to recover additional fuel and purchased power costs for the year 
the electric rate increase also took into account the expected gain on the sale of utility assets which is discussed under other electric and gas utility expenses income 
electric utility revenues increased million  or  due to a increase in overall sales volume coupled with the wisconsin retail electric rate increase 
sales volumes increased in spite of summer weather that was cooler in than in fuel expense increased million  or  due to increased production at wisconsin public service s fossil fueled and combustion turbine generation plants 
in addition  the average cost of generation at the combustion turbine plants increased largely as a result of a higher unit cost of natural gas 
generation costs at the kewaunee plant decreased in due to its scheduled outage for refueling and maintenance in the second quarter of a similar outage did not occur in the kewaunee plant was off line beginning april  and returned to full power on june  during the scheduled outage  nuclear generation was replaced with additional fossil fuel and combustion turbine generation and additional purchased power 
wisconsin public service was the operator and owner of the kewaunee plant in and purchased power expense decreased million  however  largely due to a decrease in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by wisconsin public service in compared with annual fuel costs at december  were within the fuel window authorized by the public service commission of wisconsin and  accordingly  no adjustment was made to electric rates for fuel costs 
gas utility operations wisconsin public service s gas utility margin increased million  or  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in throughput volumes 
winter weather was a factor for natural gas operations in weather was colder in than in  however  weather was warmer than normal in natural gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of a increase in the average unit cost of natural gas coupled with a increase in overall throughput volumes 
natural gas purchase costs increased million  or 
this increase resulted from a higher average unit cost of natural gas and higher gas volumes purchased of 
the higher unit cost of natural gas is reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
other electric and gas utility expenses income utility operation and maintenance expenses increased million 
electric utility operation and maintenance expenses increased million primarily due to costs associated with the scheduled outage and other maintenance activities at the kewaunee plant 
higher earnings of million on the kewaunee plant s nuclear decommissioning fund resulted in increased other income in due to regulatory practices  this higher income was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expense 
other income also included a gain of million on the sale of a combustion turbine which wisconsin public service constructed for another wisconsin utility 
the public service commission of wisconsin considered this gain in the wisconsin retail electric rate adjustment which was effective january  balance sheet wisconsin public service compared with regulatory assets increased million as the result of deferred costs related to compliance with certain nuclear regulatory commission requirements and additional regulatory assets acquired as a result of the wisconsin fuel and light merger  largely related to future environmental remediation costs 
the goodwill balance of million relates to wisconsin public service s acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in investments and other assets increased million largely as a result of wisconsin public service s ownership interest in american transmission company 
commercial paper decreased million as the result of replacing short term debt with additional long term debt at wisconsin public service 
the current portion of long term debt includes million of first mortgage bonds which mature on october  we currently have no plans to refinance these bonds with long term debt 
long term debt increased million as the result of additional senior notes issued in the third quarter of regulatory liabilities increased million primarily due to the deferral of million in pension settlement gains resulting from employees transferring from wisconsin public service to nuclear management company  llc 
financial condition wisconsin public service payments for return of capital of million were paid by wisconsin public service to wps resources in wps resources made equity contributions of million to wisconsin public service in these payments and equity contributions allowed wisconsin public service s average equity capitalization and its capitalization ratio for ratemaking to remain near target levels as established by the public service commission of wisconsin in its most recent rate order 
wps resources also contributed million of equity to wisconsin public service for the wisconsin fuel and light acquisition 
cash requirements exceeded internally generated funds by million in short term borrowings through commercial paper decreased million as the result of issuing additional long term debt at wisconsin public service in the third quarter of pretax interest coverage was times for the months ended december  standard poor s has recently reviewed the credit ratings of many of the wisconsin utilities 
the current credit ratings for wisconsin public service are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wisconsin public service corporation bonds preferred stock commercial paper aa a a aa a p we normally use internally generated funds and short term borrowing to satisfy most of our capital requirements 
we may periodically issue additional long term debt to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
wisconsin public service issued million of senior notes in the third quarter of  with part of the proceeds used to refinance million of first mortgage bonds 
the remainder of the proceeds was used to reduce short term debt and support working capital requirements 
the senior notes are secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds but become unsecured if wisconsin public service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
wisconsin public service makes large investments in capital assets 
net construction expenditures  including nuclear fuel  for wisconsin public service are expected to be approximately million in the aggregate for the through period 
larger projects include million for automated meter reading  million for computer software and systems  and million for the start of construction of generation facilities that will continue to be constructed through other capital requirements for wisconsin public service for the three year period include contributions of million to the kewaunee plant s decommissioning trust fund 
in  the second phase of wisconsin public service s agreement to purchase electricity from the de pere energy center  a gas fired cogeneration facility  will be accounted for as a capital lease 
the de pere energy center lease will be capitalized at approximately million 
regulatory on december   wisconsin public service received an order from the public service commission of wisconsin authorizing a increase in retail electric rates and a increase in retail natural gas rates for and a return on equity was approved 
the new rates were implemented on january  on april   wisconsin public service filed an application with the public service commission of wisconsin for additional rate relief in wisconsin public service requested an million  or  increase in retail electric rates and a million  or  increase in retail natural gas rates for wisconsin public service requested a return on equity  with equity constituting of the capital structure 
the public service commission of wisconsin s order  originally expected to be issued in january  has now been delayed until april of wisconsin public service received an interim rate order on december  and implemented interim rates on january  the order authorized a million  or  retail electric rate increase and a million  or retail natural gas rate increase 
interim rates are based on a return on equity  with equity constituting of the capital structure  are subject to refund to the extent interim revenues exceed revenues authorized in the final rate order  and will be in effect until superseded by the final rate order establishing new rates 
wisconsin public service anticipates that it will not be required to refund revenues collected under the interim rates 
merger with wisconsin fuel and light company the merger of wisconsin fuel and light company into wisconsin public service was completed on april  wisconsin fuel and light shareholders received shares of wps resources common stock for each share of wisconsin fuel and light s common stock 
a total of  shares were issued resulting in a purchase price of million based on an average price of  the prevailing price at the time of the merger announcement 
wisconsin public service used the purchase method of accounting and recorded million of total premium associated with the purchase 
of that total  million was recorded as goodwill and million after tax was recorded as an acquisition adjustment included in plant 
the acquisition adjustment is expected to be recovered in wisconsin retail rates over the period as approved by the public service commission of wisconsin 
american transmission company  llc in the first quarter of  wisconsin public service transferred transmission assets at their net book value to american transmission company in exchange for cash and an approximate ownership interest in american transmission company 
the public service commission of wisconsin initiated a generic docket to address the potential recovery of deferred and start up costs and increased transmission operating costs of american transmission company by the member wisconsin utilities including wisconsin public service 
completion of the docket is anticipated in the spring of and should identify the costs to be recovered and the method for recovery 
wisconsin public service began recovering some of these costs  as a result of its interim rate case order  which was implemented january  the interim recovery of these costs is subject to refund should the costs in the final generic docket be less than the costs included in the interim rates

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks wps resources has potential market risk exposure for instruments entered into for trading purposes related to commodity price risk and for instruments entered into for purposes other than trading related to interest rate risk  equity return and principal preservation risk  and commodity price risk 
there currently is no material exposure due to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
wps resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures 
interest rate risk wps resources is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term commercial paper borrowing 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
wps resources enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
the company may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
at december   wps resources utilized one interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on a variable rate loan at one of its nonregulated subsidiaries 
based on wps resources variable rate debt outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points in would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
comparatively  based on wps resources variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense in by approximately million 
these hypothetical changes are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would take action to mitigate the company s exposure to the change 
commodity price risk wps resources is exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the impact of market fluctuations in the price of certain commodities  including but not limited to electricity  natural gas  coal  fuel oil  and uranium  which are used and or sold by our subsidiaries in the normal course of their business 
we employ established policies and procedures to reduce the market risk associated with changing commodity prices  including using various types of commodity and derivative instruments 
wps resources exposure to commodity price risk in its utility business is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
therefore  the below value at risk amounts do not include measures for wps resources regulated utilities 
to further manage commodity price risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various duration for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
wps power development also uses purchase and or sale contracts for electric fuel and electricity to help manage its commodity price risk 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  all of wps power development s activities are classified as non trading 
wps energy services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with the changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers 
wps energy services also utilizes these instruments to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases  as well as trading activities 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  all of wps energy services activities  including all of its energy commodity purchase and sale contracts and its gas in storage inventory  are classified as trading 
wps energy services therefore follows mark to market accounting as required by emerging issues task force issue no 
value at risk to measure commodity price risk exposure  wps resources performs a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from adverse changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that may trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
at wps resources  var is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
it does not take into account higher order risk exposures  so it may not provide a good approximation of the risk in a portfolio with substantial option positions 
we utilized a delta normal approximation because our portfolio has limited exposure to optionality 
our var calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options as well as commodities held in inventory  such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant 
our var amount for trading activities was calculated to be million at december  compared with million at december  our var amount for non trading activities was calculated to be million at december  compared with million at december  a significant portion of the var amount related to non trading activities is mitigated by wps power development s generating capabilities  which are excluded from the var calculation as required by the securities and exchange commission rules 
for the year ended december   the average  high  and low var amounts for trading activities were million  million  and million  respectively 
the same amounts for the year ended december  were million  million  and million 
for the year ended december  the average  high  and low var amounts for non trading activities were million  million  and million  respectively 
the same amounts for the year ended december  were million  million  and million 
the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts 
equity return and principal preservation risk wps resources currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits and nuclear decommissioning through various external trust funds 
these funds are managed by various investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
the pension liability is adequately funded and under normal market conditions future required contributions to the plan are unlikely 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits or nuclear decommissioning could impact future contributions 
wps resources monitors the trust fund portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
all decommissioning costs and most of the employee benefit costs relate to wps resources regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through the purchase and sale of gas in canada by one of our nonregulated subsidiaries 
this risk to wps resources at december  is immaterial
