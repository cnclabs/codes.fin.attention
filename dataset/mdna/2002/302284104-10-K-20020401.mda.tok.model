item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our primary source of revenue is fees we earn for providing our hr business process management services under long term contracts 
we also receive additional revenue from our consulting services 
we recognize revenue for our services as the services are performed 
we fulfill some of our service delivery obligations through use of third party vendors  including vendors that had previously contracted directly with our clients and were then assigned to us for management in connection with our process management services 
we may continue to use these vendors  hire replacement vendors  or provide some of these services directly  however  we are responsible for the delivery and acceptability of these third party vendor services 
we include in revenue all charges for services that we are contractually obligated to provide to our clients  whether we provide these services directly using our own personnel or through third party vendors 
we pay the charges of the third party vendors that provide services for which we are responsible to our clients  and such costs are included in our cost of revenue 
in many cases our initial cost of paying these vendors is equal to our revenue attributable to their services 
in order to realize a profit from revenue received in connection with these third party vendor contracts we must reduce these vendor costs by improving efficiencies  obtaining more favorable pricing  or performing the services ourselves at a lower cost 
to date  we have typically generated leads for potential process management clients through our management  existing consulting relationships  our board of directors  third party consultants  contact with key executives at global corporations or direct communication from such companies 
after initial discussions with and qualification of the potential client  we typically enter into a non disclosure agreement 
if subsequent discussions result in a mutual desire to pursue a transaction  we then typically enter into a non binding letter of intent with the client which establishes a framework for due diligence and contract negotiations 
our letter of intent may provide for reimbursement of some or all of our direct and indirect costs incurred during this process 
our contracts are generally structured so that we receive a fee that is no greater than our client s historical cost of operating the functions assumed by us 
we are generally required to provide a minimum savings to the client on a portion of the contract after about one year from contract signing  and  we may be required to share further savings with our clients in negotiated gain sharing arrangements 
the amount of minimum savings is determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable contracts 
once we have signed a contract with a client  we transition its hr processes to our facilities and control 
after we have transitioned a client s processes  we work to transform these processes in order to increase efficiencies and reduce costs 
typically the costs we have incurred during the transition period for the services provided and the transitioning of the client s processes have exceeded the revenue received from the client during the transition period 
by transforming client processes and operating on a long term contract basis  we seek to reduce the costs of service delivery below the minimum savings provided in the contract  recover the excess costs incurred during the transition period and realize a profit for the contract period 
we incurred a net loss of million in  exclusive of a non cash warrant charge of million  and million in  exclusive of a non cash warrant charge of million 
our net loss in was million  exclusive of business optimization costs of million 
we may incur losses in future years 
in the next two years  we anticipate ongoing significant expense to fund the development and expansion of our technology and general operating infrastructures 
we may also make substantial investments to pursue  obtain and transition new client contracts  and to develop new service center capacity to accommodate any growth we may achieve beyond the capacity of our existing service center infrastructure 
to the extent that revenue does not increase at a rate commensurate with our increasing costs and expenditures  our future operating results and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates exult s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon exult s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires exult to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  exult evaluates its estimates  including those related to long term service contracts  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
exult bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
exult believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
exult recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long term contracts based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total expected costs 
this method relies to some degree on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
exult follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates that would result in any contract losses are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
exult maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of exult s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
exult records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while exult has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event exult were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should exult determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   exult has million of deferred tax assets  arising primarily from its net operating losses  for which it has fully reserved through its valuation allowance 
results of operations our primary activities during were organization  planning and certain work performed for our first business process management client prior to entering into the related long term contract 
we did not generate any outsourcing process revenues from long term contracts during at december   we had approximately employees 
as of december   we had five business process management clients and approximately employees 
as of december   we had six business process management clients and approximately  employees 
due to the early stage of our business during  our operating results do not bear significant relationship to our operating results for the years ended december  and in addition  in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results  including our revenue  gross profit loss and expenses as a percentage of revenue  should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated for the year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit loss expenses product development selling  general and administrative 
depreciation and amortization warrant charges total expenses loss from operations interest income  net net loss includes million of business optimization costs in excluding such costs  selling  general and administrative expense was of revenue 
revenue revenue for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the amount included million  or  of revenue derived from five business process management clients  and the amount included million  or  of revenue derived from four business process management clients  respectively 
the balance of our and revenue primarily consisted of consulting revenue generated from various clients 
as our process management business expands  we expect the relative contribution of revenue derived from consulting clients to continue to decrease 
revenue for the year ended december   primarily consisted of approximately million billed to our first business process management client  bp amoco  for work performed before we entered into a long term contract with this client in december the balance of our revenue primarily consisted of consulting revenue generated from various clients 
the revenue increase for as compared to principally resulted from the progressive transition of service responsibility to exult under five process management contracts which were executed at various dates from december through november the contract for the company s sixth process management client was executed in october  with process transition occurring in january  so this contract did not result in any revenue in for the years ended december  and  one process management client accounted for and  respectively  of revenue 
a second process management client accounted for of revenue in and generated no revenue in no other client accounted for more than of revenue in and an important part of our revenue growth to date has resulted from sales of additional services to existing clients 
the potential for further revenue growth within our existing client base is finite  and we must continue to attract new clients to sustain growth 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively  and our gross margin loss for the same periods was  and  respectively  as a percentage of revenue 
in and  cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with third party vendors that we manage who provide services for our clients within the scope of our process management contracts  compensation and benefits paid to our employees who are directly involved in providing our services  computer and communications equipment and services costs  and facilities costs 
in  cost of revenue consisted primarily of compensation and benefits paid to our employees for work performed for one of our process management clients prior to the execution of the long term contract 
the increase in the cost of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  principally resulted from the progressive transition of service responsibility to exult under our various process management contracts and the continuing expansion of our infrastructure and service capacity 
we began to operate our first client service center during the first six months of  opened a second in the latter half of  and began operating our third primary center during the first quarter of we did not begin operating our fourth primary center until the first quarter of  so results do not include any costs associated with operating that center 
operating expense will tend to increase to support any growth we may achieve  and our profitability depends upon our ability to leverage existing resources across a broader revenue base and limit increases in operating expense associated with new business to levels significantly below our clients historical costs of operating the processes we assume 
we have incurred  and may continue to incur  negative gross margins as we continue to transition and transform our clients hr processes 
product development expense product development expense for the years ended december   and  was million  or as a percentage of revenue  million  or as a percentage of revenue  and  or as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
product development expense consists primarily of consultant costs and the compensation of our employees who are directly associated with the development of our product features and internet software and capabilities 
we cannot be certain that our product development efforts will provide us with the desired results or will be economically feasible 
we increased our spending for product development during as compared to during  we redirected a portion of these resources to implementation and transformation activities relating to the progressive transition of service responsibility to exult for our process management contracts  resulting in a decrease in product and development expense for as compared to selling  general and administrative expense for the years ended december   and  selling  general and administrative expense was million  or as a percentage of revenue  million  or as a percentage of revenue  and million  or as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense generally consists of compensation for employees engaged in marketing  promoting and selling our services  and for management and administrative personnel 
selling  general and administrative expense also includes third party consulting and marketing expenditures  as well as facilities and office costs  and legal  accounting and recruiting fees and expenses 
also included in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  were business optimization costs totaling million  consisting of severance charges of million including non cash option acceleration charges of million  certain wind up costs resulting in a million charge including severance costs of million associated with the elimination of two secondary  non strategic processing centers  and a million non cash charge arising from the write off of a research database that we have determined is no longer a strategic component of our business 
we call these charges business optimization costs because they reflect our pursuit of strategies intended to enhance our efficiency and profitability as our operating scale increases and our business progresses toward operational maturity 
we may incur business optimization costs from time to time as we implement new organization structures  technologies  processes and other changes in our business 
exclusive of business optimization costs  selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or as a percentage of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in amount for as compared to primarily resulted from the redeployment of certain personnel and other resources to direct client activities  at which time the costs associated with such employees were included in cost of revenue 
the decrease in percentage of revenue for as compared to primarily resulted from the revenue growth experienced in as compared to selling  general and administrative expense increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of the continuing expansion of our infrastructure 
however  as a percentage of revenue  these expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue during as compared to depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december   and was million  or as a percentage of revenue  million  or as a percentage of revenue  and  or as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
included in the  and amounts was million  million and  respectively  of depreciation and amortization expense from property and equipment 
also included in the  and amounts was intangible asset amortization of million  million and  respectively  and million  million and  respectively  of deferred compensation amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from property and equipment reflects the continuing build out of our infrastructure and service delivery capabilities 
warrant charges warrant charges were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amount included a million charge for warrants issued in connection with a business process management contract and a million charge for warrants issued in exchange for consulting and recruiting services 
the amount consisted of a charge for warrants issued in connection with the sale of common stock 
in  no warrant charges were incurred 
interest income  net interest income  net for years ended december   and consisted of interest income of million  million and  respectively  partially offset by interest expense of  million and  respectively 
interest income is generated primarily from short term investing of cash in excess of current requirements 
interest expense is associated with certain capitalized leases and the debt incurred to purchase the gunn partners  inc assets in november income taxes we incurred losses since our founding in  resulting in federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in and  respectively 
the foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the tax benefit generated by the net operating losses because of the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets 
net loss the foregoing resulted in a net loss for the years ended december   and of million  or per basic and diluted share  million  or per basic and diluted share  and million  or per basic and diluted share  respectively 
excluding business optimization costs of million for the year ended december   the net loss would have been million  or per basic and diluted share 
excluding warrant charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  and reflecting the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of the company s preferred stock during and  the net losses would have been million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in october  we have financed our operations primarily with equity contributions including private placements of our capital stock for consideration of million in  million in  million in and million in  the net proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings of million in june and million in august  respectively  and  to a lesser extent  by cash generated from our business and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the amount of million included million from a warrant issued in connection with the sale of common stock and million of indebtedness owed to us that was subsequently satisfied with prepaid rent and an intangible asset in connection with one of our business process management contracts 
the intangible asset is being amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the contract 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we obtained our first three process management contracts in december and january and began generating revenue from these contracts during the first quarter of we obtained two additional process management contracts during the second half of and began generating revenue from both of these agreements by the first quarter of we obtained our sixth and seventh process management contracts in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively  and expect to begin generating revenue from these agreements during the first half of during the years ended december   and  we continued using operating cash to pursue additional business opportunities and the development of our corporate infrastructure 
we also expended operating cash in support of revenue generated by our process management contracts and to fund the transition and transformation costs associated with these process management contracts 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in  and was used to construct and expand our client service centers and our internal systems 
we generated million  million and million in cash from financing activities during the years ended december   and primarily from private placements and public offerings of our stock 
we expect to generate negative operating cash flow until we become profitable 
we expect to increase our investments in property and equipment to support the expansion and renovation of our facilities  including our existing client service centers  and to purchase related computer and other equipment necessary to support our client contracts and growth 
in addition  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses  assets  services and technologies 
such acquisitions  if completed  may require significant cash expenditures 
we believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
we anticipate rapid growth and we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to address unanticipated operating issues  finance acquisitions  obtain new client contracts with capital investment requirements  finance other strategic opportunities  and maintain adequate cash balances to satisfy the expectations of prospective clients 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds  we may be unable to fund our operations or strategic initiatives
