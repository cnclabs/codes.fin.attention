item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
this double digit revenue growth resulted in significant operating leverage for the company with operating profits earnings before interest and taxes  or ebit increasing by to million in as compared to million in operating profits in fiscal were impacted by a thousand non cash charge related to management stock options and by a severance charge in the climax business of thousand 
in contrast  operating profits in fiscal benefited from other income primarily gains on asset sales of thousand 
without regard to those elements of other income and expense  the operating profit improvement would have been year over year 
the improvement in operating results in was attributable both to the continued growth in newer services offered by the industrial services segment  as well as a rebound in profitability of the equipment sales and rental segment 
with respect to industrial services  newer services comprise those services whose offerings began during fiscal year ndt inspection  field machining and technical bolting 
traditional services include leak repair  hot tapping and fugitive emissions monitoring 
the following sets forth the revenue composition of industrial services between new and traditional services increase traditional services    new services    as the table illustrates  year over year revenue growth in the industrial services segment came primarily from the newer service lines  which grew at a rate 
this growth has come primarily as a result of market share gains earned by improving the penetration of new service offerings to the company s traditional customer base as well as an increase in the demand for our inspection services to the pipeline industry due to new pipeline construction and increased regulatory activities in the pipeline industry 
management believes that demand for the company s traditional services is  generally  a function of the population of high temperature  high pressure piping systems 
demand is also somewhat related  especially for leak repair and hot tapping  to the operating performance of our customers particularly in the refining  pipeline  and petrochemical industries 
generally  as those customers margins improve  more funds are expended for the specialized industrial services offered by the company 
through the third quarter which ended february   traditional service revenues were behind year over year amounts due to a significant softening in third quarter demand 
in the fourth quarter ended may   revenues from traditional services grew at a rate in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in the nearly increase for the year overall 
the fourth quarter strengthening was impacted by two new multi location  multi service contracts which came on stream during the quarter 
the equipment sales and rental segment also achieved a strong rebound during the fourth quarter of the year 
through the third quarter  the segment had operated at a small loss year to date  partially due to the recognition of thousand of costs associated with a reduction in work force implemented in december in the fourth quarter  revenues increased compared to the same quarter of fiscal due principally to a thousand shipment to the us navy 
as a result of the strong revenue growth  operating profits for the segment were nearly thousand in the fourth quarter 
this strong performance in the quarter resulted in an operating profit for the year of thousand  a thousand improvement over the loss reported last year of thousand 
overall  gross margins were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the improvement reflects better margins in both the industrial services segment and the equipment sales and rental segment 
industrial services margins improved primarily in the ndt inspection line due to better performance in texas locations 
climax margins improved due to cost reductions efforts and due to the business rebound experienced in the fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal versus of revenues in fiscal this reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues illustrates the operating leverage that management believes exists in the business double digit revenue growth will result in a faster rate of increase in profits since revenue growth can be supported without a proportionate increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
the non cash g a compensation expense of thousand in fiscal was related to the vesting of performance stock options previously awarded to the company s chief executive officer 
when the ceo joined the company in  he was awarded  performance based stock options at the market price on the date of award of per share 
one third of these options vest upon the sustained achievement of average stock prices of   and per share 
the first standard was met near the end of may  when the price of team s stock was per share 
consequently  at that time  the company was required to recognize a non cash g a compensation charge associated with one third of the options approximately per share  net of tax benefit 
income tax expense as a percent of pre tax income was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the tax rate reflects a  tax benefit associated with the liquidation of a small subsidiary in the united kingdom in that year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
this double digit revenue growth resulted in significant operating leverage for the company with operating profits earnings before interest and taxes  or ebit increasing by to million in as compared to million in the improvement in operating results in was attributable to the industrial services segment whose revenues increased by million  or  to million 
ebit for the industrial services segment was million  an increase of over the revenue growth occurred in both traditional service lines leak repair  hot tapping  and emissions control monitoring and in the newer service lines inspection  field machining and technical bolting 
revenue from traditional service lines grew by over fiscal  which is a result of a combination of factors fiscal was a strong year for refining margins  which results in an increased demand for the company s on stream service offerings to avoid the necessity of our customers having to shut down operating units  we obtained significant new contracts for fugitive emissions monitoring in fiscal as a result of a trend toward customers out sourcing of these compliance functions to professional service providers such as team  coupled with an increase in enforcement actions by federal and state agencies  and an increase in market penetration for our traditional services 
team s newer services grew at an even faster rate with revenue from inspection  field machining and technical bolting growing by over fiscal the rapid growth in these services is a result of two primary factors an increase in the demand for our inspection services to the pipeline industry due to new pipeline construction and increased regulatory activities in the pipeline industry  and a continuing penetration of our newer services within our existing customer base 
in contrast to the services segment  the equipment sales and rental segment experienced a disappointing fiscal  with sales of million being less than the fiscal amount  with the significant portion of the reduction coming in the first half of the year 
management believes the sales decline is due primarily to a softness in capital equipment markets 
overall  gross margins were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the reduction is associated with the severely depressed margins at climax during the first half of fiscal and due to pricing concessions to sustain the growth in services revenues 
the decline in margins was compensated for by an overall reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  which were of revenues in fiscal versus of revenues in fiscal this reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues illustrates the operating leverage that management believes exists in the business double digit revenue growth will result in a faster rate of increase in profits since revenue growth can be supported without a proportionate increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
income tax expense as a percent of pre tax income was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal due to the recognition of a  effective tax benefit associated with the liquidation of a small subsidiary in the united kingdom in liquidity and capital resources at may   the company s liquid working capital cash and accounts receivable  less current liabilities totaled million  an increase of thousand since may  the company utilizes excess operating funds to automatically reduce the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at may   the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility was million and approximately million was available to borrow under the facility 
during fiscal  the company reduced its total outstanding debt by million as a result of cash flow from operations 
in fiscal  the company also expended million to reacquire an additional  shares of its common stock  including  shares pursuant to a self tender offer and  on the open market pursuant to a stock repurchase plan 
in the opinion of management  the company currently has sufficient funds and adequate financial sources available to meet its anticipated liquidity needs 
management believes that cash flows from operations  cash balances and available borrowings will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to finance anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
the company has a million bank credit facility that consists of i a  revolving loan  which matures september   ii  in term loans for business acquisitions and iii a  mortgage loan 
amounts borrowed against the term loans are due in quarterly installments in the amount of  until the loans mature on september  amounts borrowed against the mortgage loan are repaid in quarterly installments of  until its maturity date of september  amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a marginal rate over either the libor rate or the prime rate 
at may   the company s marginal rate was over the libor rate 
the weighted average rate on outstanding borrowings at may  is approximately 
the company also pays a commitment fee of 
per annum on the average amount of the unused availability under the revolving loan 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that expires in september  and which qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
the agreement was entered into in to hedge the exposure of an increase in interest rates 
pursuant to this agreement  which covers approximately million of outstanding debt  the company exchanged a variable libor rate for a fixed libor rate of approximately 
two other swap agreements  covering approximately million  expired on december  as the interest rates on the credit facility are based on market rates  the fair value of amounts outstanding under the facility approximate the carrying value 
the interest rate swap agreements  which have no carrying value  had a negative mark to market value of approximately  and  at may  and  respectively 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting expected cash flows using quoted market interest rates 
loans under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the terms of the agreement require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit investments  liens  leases and indebtedness  and dividends  among other things 
at may  and  the company was in compliance with all credit facility covenants 
at may   the company was contingently liable for million in outstanding stand by letters of credit and  at that date  approximately million was available to borrow under the credit facility 
critical accounting policies goodwill the company has million of recorded goodwill associated with business acquisitions made in fiscal year of that amount  approximately million is associated with the industrial services segment and million is associated with the equipment sales and rental business 
through may   goodwill was being amortized over years and its carrying value was periodically evaluated using management s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
under sfas no 
 there has been no impairment of the company s recorded goodwill 
effective at the beginning of the company s next fiscal year  june   we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but that it be reviewed for impairment annually using a methodology that is different than the methodology required under sfas no 
management is presently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
at present  management does not expect there to be any adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues by providing a variety of industrial services including leak repair  hot tapping  emissions control services  field machining and inspection services 
in addition  the company sells and rents portable machine tools through one of its subsidiaries 
for all of these services  revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when product is shipped and risk of ownership passes to the customer 
deferred income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company computes its deferred tax balances by multiplying these temporary differences by the current tax rates 
if deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities  the company must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future 
a valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized 
as of may  management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will have sufficient future taxable income to allow it to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recorded 
loss contingencies the company is involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  management consults with its legal counsel and evaluates the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time 
currently  the company is involved with two significant matters  which are summarized in legal proceedings above 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of may  to provide for any losses that may arise from these contingencies 
other contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company enters into capital leases related to certain computer and equipment and software  as well as operating leases related to facilities and transportation and other equipment 
these operating leases are over terms ranging from one to five years with typical renewal options and escalation clauses 
the company is occasionally required to post letters of credit generally issued by a bank as collateral under certain agreements 
a letter of credit commits the issuer to remit specified amounts to the holder  if the holder demonstrates that the company has failed to meet its obligations under the letter of credit 
if this were to occur  the company would be obligated to reimburse the issuer for any payments the issuer was required to remit to the holder of the letter of credit 
to date  the company has not had any claims made against a letter of credit that resulted in a payment made be the issuer or the company to the holder 
the company believes that it is unlikely that it will have to fund claims made under letters of credit in the foreseeable future 
at may   the company s contractual obligations are summarized as follows year ending capital operating debt may  leases leases obligations total thereafter   total     new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and no

these statements also require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met  which includes an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging instrument 
the effective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported as other comprehensive income  with all other changes reported in net income 
the company s only derivative instrument is an interest rate swap agreement that expires in september  and which qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
the agreement was entered into in to hedge the exposure of an increase in interest rates 
pursuant to this agreement  which covers approximately million of outstanding debt  the company exchanged a variable libor rate for a fixed libor rate of approximately 
two other swap agreements  covering approximately million  expired on december  adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in a before tax charge to other comprehensive income of thousand on june  during fiscal  there has been an additional before tax charge to other comprehensive income of thousand to reflect the increase in the mark to market liability associated with the swaps resulting from the continued reduction in variable rates below the fixed rate obtained by the company 
in fiscal interest expense includes approximately thousand pertaining to settlements under the swap agreements 
approximately thousand of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense over the course of the next twelve months 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for business combinations and sfas no 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no

 goodwill that arises from purchases after june  cannot be amortized 
in addition  sfas no 
requires the continuation of the amortization of goodwill and all amortizable intangible assets through the end of the fiscal year preceding the adoption year  but amortization of existing goodwill will cease on the first day of the adoption year 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will adopt sfas no 
as of the beginning of its next fiscal year that commences june  the company has six months from the date it initially applies sfas no 
to test goodwill for impairment and any impairment charge resulting from the initial application of the new standard must be classified as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
thereafter  goodwill should be tested for impairment at least annually and impairment losses will be presented in the operating section of the income statement 
management is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a credit facility and interest rate swap agreements  which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at may   the company has floating rate obligations totaling million outstanding under its credit facility see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the exposure of these obligations to increases in short term interest rates is limited in part by an interest rate swap agreement entered into by the company 
this swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on approximately million of the company s variable rate debt 
under these swap agreements  payments are made based on a fixed rate of and received on a libor based variable rate 
any change in the value of the swap agreements  real or hypothetical  would be offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
with respect to the remaining million of floating rate debt not covered by swap agreements  a increase in interest rates could result in an annual increase in interest expense of thousand
