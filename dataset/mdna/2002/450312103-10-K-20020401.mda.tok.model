item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background and overview the company  which was incorporated in delaware in  together with its wholly owned subsidiary  i stat canada limited  develops  manufactures and markets medical diagnostic products for blood analysis that provide health care professionals with immediate and accurate critical  diagnostic information at the point of patient care 
the company s current products  known as the i stat r system  consist of portable  hand held analyzers and single use disposable cartridges  each of which simultaneously performs different combinations of commonly ordered blood tests in approximately two minutes 
the i stat system also includes peripheral components that enable the results of tests to be transmitted by infrared means to both a proprietary information system for managing the user s point of care testing program and to the user s information systems for billing and archiving 
the i stat system currently performs blood tests for sodium  potassium  chloride  glucose  creatinine  urea nitrogen  hematocrit  ionized calcium  lactate  celite r act activated clotting time  arterial blood gases  and bicarbonate  and derives certain other values  such as total carbon dioxide  base excess  anion gap  hemoglobin and o saturation  by calculation from the tests performed 
the company continues to engage in research and development in order to improve its existing products and develop new products based on the i stat system technology 
the company is currently developing three additional tests for the measurement of coagulation kaolin act  partial thromboplastin time aptt  and prothrombin time pt 
assuming timely regulatory approvals  the company expects to begin commercial introduction of the kaolin act and pt tests during the second half of the company also is conducting research and development on cardiac marker tests 
in the fourth quarter of  the company introduced the i stat r analyzer 
the i stat analyzer permits a customer to run all i stat cartridges as well as abbott medisense r glucose strips on one integrated hand held device 
the i stat analyzer also incorporates a number of enhancements  including a bar code reader  an improved user interface  and an enhanced data management system which  in conjunction with a central data management system developed by the company  enhances the customer s ability to centrally manage a widely distributed point of care testing program 
prior to november   the company marketed and distributed its products in the united states and canada principally through its own direct sales and marketing organization  in japan through japanese marketing partners  in europe through hewlett packard company hp and in mexico  south america  china  australia  and certain other asian and pacific rim countries  through selected distribution channels 
on september   the company entered into a long term sales  marketing and research alliance with abbott laboratories abbott  which  among other things  since november   has altered significantly the manner in which the company markets and sells its products worldwide 
the majority of the company s revenues are now derived from abbott 
see alliance with abbott laboratories  below  for a description of the company s agreements with abbott 
results of operations the company generated total net revenues of approximately million  million and million in  and  including international revenues as a percentage of worldwide revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
total net revenues from abbott represented approximately  and of the company s worldwide total net revenues for  and  respectively 
the million increase in total net revenues from to was primarily due to the increased sales volume of the company s cartridges and sales of the i stat analyzer which was introduced in december  partially offset by the elimination of research and development reimbursements from abbott during cartridge sales volume increased to  units in from  units in increased cartridge revenue from the increase in sales volume was partially offset by a decrease in worldwide average selling prices per cartridge from in to in the decrease in worldwide average selling prices is primarily a function of the pricing arrangements under the strategic alliance with abbott  which produces lower average selling prices as volume increases  and the impact of discounting by abbott to its customers in the united states 
for the foreseeable future  cartridge average selling prices are expected to continue to decline because of the product pricing arrangements applicable under the strategic alliance between the company and abbott 
see alliance with abbott laboratories 
worldwide analyzer sales volume increased to  units in from  units in worldwide analyzer revenue increased in primarily because of sales of the new  higher priced i stat analyzer 
during  the company did not receive any research and development reimbursements from abbott 
the company had received approximately million of research and development reimbursements from abbott in the million increase in total net revenues from to was primarily due to increased shipment volume of the company s cartridges  reflecting higher cartridge consumption by existing hospital users and the addition of new hospital users 
cartridge shipments increased to  units in from  units in revenues from the increased cartridge shipments were partially offset by lower worldwide average selling prices per cartridge  which declined from approximately to in the same periods 
total net revenues in and also include approximately million million of research and development reimbursements and million of sales and marketing reimbursements and million million of research and development reimbursements and million of sales and marketing reimbursements  respectively  from abbott 
the manufacturing costs as a percentage of product sales associated with product sales in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales generally decreases with increased shipment volume of the company s cartridges and improvements in manufacturing productivity and yields 
however  despite an increase in shipment volume  cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales were higher in due to manufacturing process problems 
the company took a charge in the second and third quarters of totaling million to write off inventory caused by quality problems with material supplied by a vendor 
the company generated higher than normal manufacturing efficiency gains in the third quarter of in rebuilding its inventory  which had a favorable  and partially offsetting impact on cost of products sold  as a percentage of product sales 
the company experienced a second manufacturing problem in the fourth quarter of  also caused by defective material from the same supplier  which resulted in a write off of approximately million of work in process inventory and a reduced level of production 
reduced levels of production and higher than normal scrap levels continued into the first quarter of cost of products sold  as a percentage of product sales  subsequently improved during due to the rebuilding of cartridge inventories  which caused fixed manufacturing costs to be spread over a larger number of product units and improvements in cartridge production yields 
in  despite an increase in shipment volume  manufacturing costs as a percentage of product sales increased primarily as a result of lower average selling prices per unit and a charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of  which was related to the write off of certain cartridges in inventory and the replacement of certain cartridges in the field that exhibited a higher than usual quality check rejection rate 
although this matter has been resolved  the company does expect to incur an additional charge of approximately million in the first quarter of for product that was produced in the company incurred research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenues of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the personnel  material  equipment and facilities necessary to conduct new product development 
research and development expenditures may increase over the next three years 
the amount and timing of such increase will depend upon numerous factors including the level of activity at any point in time  the breadth of the company s development objectives and the success of its development programs 
revenues from abbott of approximately million and million for research and development activities are included in net revenues in and  respectively 
there were no research and development revenues from abbott in and abbott currently is not funding any of the company s research and development programs 
the company incurred general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

included in revenues are amounts reimbursed by abbott for services performed by the implementation coordinators  approximating million  million and million in  and  respectively 
each of the company and abbott have the right to terminate the alliance at the end of  if either party gives twelve months notice at the end of the alliance may be extended  as described below see alliance with abbott laboratories 
the company is currently evaluating abbott s performance  and may not continue the alliance after consequently  sales and marketing expenses may increase significantly in and as the company begins to rebuild the infrastructure necessary to assume primary responsibility for sales and marketing activities 
investment income was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the changes in investment income primarily reflect changes in the level of cash and cash equivalent balances and interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a charge of  related to the write down of certain fixed assets located at the company s canadian facility  which were associated with certain projects that had not been completed 
the write down is a result of the company s decision not to pursue certain projects as lower cost alternative methods were found 
the carrying values of the assets have been reduced to their net realizable values  which is based on their estimated sales price less any selling costs 
in and  the new jersey economic development authority approved the company s application to sell new jersey state income tax benefits under the new jersey technology tax transfer program the program 
during the fourth quarters of and  the company recognized  and  respectively  from the sale of these tax benefits 
the program requires that the company maintain certain employment levels in new jersey and that the proceeds from the sale of the tax benefits be spent in new jersey 
there is no guarantee that the company will qualify for this program in the future or that the program will not be terminated by the state of new jersey 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for new jersey income tax purposes  which expire in varying amounts through in  the company recorded accretion of preferred stock of approximately  and dividends on preferred stock of approximately  the accretion of preferred stock relates to the issuance by the company of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock the series c stock in august  which was subsequently redeemed in december  and the issuance of series d redeemable convertible preferred stock the series d stock in december both the series c stock and the series d stock were initially recorded at their relative fair values and net of allocated issuance expenses 
the accretion recorded by the company reflects the amortization of the difference between the net fair value and the redemption or stated value of such stock 
the company recorded the series c stock  related warrants and common stock issued in the transaction at their net relative fair values of million  million and million  respectively  which were determined by an independent  third party appraisal firm and were net of aggregate issuance expenses of million 
the series c stock was accreted from its net relative fair value on the date of issuance of approximately million to its redemption value on november  of approximately million 
the resulting accretion of approximately million is shown as accretion of preferred stock below the net loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company recorded the series d stock and the warrants to purchase common stock the series d warrants issued in the transaction at their net relative fair values of million and million  respectively  which were determined by an independent  third party appraisal firm and were net of aggregate issuance expenses of million 
the series d stock is being accreted over a period of ten years from its net relative fair value on the date of issuance of approximately million to its stated value of million 
the resulting accretion of million is shown below net loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the series d stock carries a dividend 
the company recorded a dividend at its fair value of approximately  for the period the series d stock was outstanding during december the dividend was not paid in cash  but was accrued and added to the liquidation preference of the series d stock 
the dividend is either accrued or payable in cash quarterly  at the option of the company 
also included in the accretion of preferred stock is a million charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters of relating to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the series c stock 
this million charge was subsequently reversed in december as a result of the company s redemption of the series c stock on december  in january  the company decided to consolidate all its cartridge assembly operations in its manufacturing facility in ontario  canada 
in order to facilitate this move  the company relocated its cartridge assembly operation from plainsboro  new jersey  to its manufacturing facility in ontario  canada 
the relocation of cartridge assembly commenced in june and was completed in april as a result of this consolidation of operations  employees in the cartridge assembly operations were notified during the first quarter of that their employment would be terminated 
in addition  the company s lease for its instrument operations  engineering  customer support  selected research and development  marketing and administrative facility in princeton  new jersey  expired in september the company relocated these activities to a  square foot leased facility in east windsor  new jersey 
the product distribution operations formerly located in the company s plainsboro  new jersey facility were relocated to the company s east windsor  new jersey facility in early the charge to earnings in for these relocations  including severance and retention payments to affected employees of million  for the physical move of equipment  rent and utilities on the unoccupied plainsboro facility until that lease expired in february  and for miscellaneous costs was approximately million 
an additional charge to earnings of approximately million occurred in retention payments were charged to expense over the retention period 
net loss available to common stockholders in increased to approximately million  or per share  from approximately million  or per share in net loss in decreased to approximately million or per share  from approximately million or per share in the weighted average number of shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the weighted average number of shares primarily reflect the conversion of  shares of series b preferred stock into  shares of common stock in march  the issuance of  shares of common stock in august  and the exercise of employee stock options in each year 
the weighted average shares used in computing the basic losses per share do not include any potentially dilutive instruments  such as options  warrants or convertible preferred stock  as such inclusion would be anti dilutive ie  decrease the net loss per share 
the principal factors contributing to the large increase in net loss from to were the absence of abbott research and development reimbursements discussed previously a million difference  the decrease in average selling prices for cartridges sold through abbott  increases in manufacturing costs also discussed previously  and million in payments made by the company in settlement of the intellectual property litigation discussed below 
contingencies the company was a defendant in a case entitled nova biomedical corporation  plaintiff v 
i stat corporation  defendant 
the complaint  which was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on june   alleged infringement by the company of nova biomedical corporation s nova us patent no 
 the patent 
in february  the court entered summary judgment in favor of the company on the issue of patent infringement 
the plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the federal circuit 
the federal circuit affirmed two of the grounds of the dismissal proper interpretation of the patent and that the company does not literally infringe  but remanded the case to the district court with instructions to reconsider whether the company s device performs a certain measurement in a substantially equivalent way to a method covered by the patent  and therefore infringes under the doctrine of equivalents 
a jury trial was scheduled for july management concluded that the uncertainty inherent in any jury trial as well as the drain on the company s resources merited a resolution of this lawsuit 
accordingly  on july  the company entered into a license agreement and a settlement agreement under which the company agreed to pay nova approximately million  which was recorded as a charge in the second quarter of pursuant to the agreements  million was paid on july   a retroactive royalty of million was paid on august  for the period of january  through june   and million plus interest was due to be paid over one year in equal quarterly installments  pursuant to a secured promissory note 
the promissory note was prepaid on august  the license agreement provides for the payment to nova of a royalty equal to of the invoice price of products sold in the united states after january   which products determine hematocrit levels according to any method used by the company prior to december   as well as any method covered by the patent 
the royalties are payable through the life of the patent july  
the company has commercialized products that determine hematocrit levels using a method that was not used by the company prior to december  and which the company believes is not covered by the patent 
consequently  the company does not believe that it owes any additional royalties to nova 
on february   nova filed a demand for arbitration claiming that the method by which the company s products determine hematocrit are covered under the patent and the license agreement 
nova is seeking royalties from july  to date 
if the company is unsuccessful in defending its position in the arbitration and does not develop new methods that do not utilize the covered technology  it may be forced to continue to pay royalties to nova through the life of the patent and million in respect of products sold through december  the company plans to defend this matter vigorously 
the company was a defendant in a case entitled customedix corporation  plaintiff v 
i stat corporation  defendant 
the complaint  which was filed in the united states district court for the district of connecticut on december   alleged infringement by i stat of customedix s us patent no 
 the plaintiff sought injunctive relief and an accounting for i stat s profits and the damages to customedix from such alleged infringement 
the company was prepared to contest the case vigorously  did not believe that it had infringed the customedix patent and had obtained an opinion from recognized patent counsel to the effect that no infringement had occurred 
however  management concluded that the uncertainty inherent in any litigation as well as the drain on management s time and the company s resources merited an out of court resolution of this lawsuit 
accordingly  on june   the company entered into a settlement agreement under which the company paid the plaintiff million and the plaintiff agreed to permanently withdraw the complaint and to release the company from any and all claims of whatsoever nature that the plaintiff may have had against the company  whether under the referenced patent or otherwise 
a charge in the amount of million was recorded in the second quarter of in connection with the settlement of this litigation 
the company and abbott are in disagreement over the amount of money abbott is entitled to for the sharing of certain cartridge production cost savings resulting from an increase in sales volume 
this disputed item relates to different interpretations of certain terms of the distribution agreement between abbott and the company 
if this disagreement is not resolved amicably  under the distribution agreement between the company and abbott it must be resolved through binding arbitration 
management of the company believes that abbott s position on this issue in dispute is without merit and that  in the event that this issue is resolved through arbitration  the company will not incur any additional liability to abbott 
the disagreement regarding the sharing of certain cartridge production cost savings resulting from an increase in sales volume over the past three years is approximately million at december   and if this matter is resolved in favor of abbott  which management of the company believes is unlikely  the company s cost of goods sold would increase by up to the amount in dispute 
such adjustment would be made when  and if  it is determined that an unfavorable outcome to the company is probable 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  an increase of approximately million from the december  balance of approximately million 
the increase primarily reflects the receipt of approximately million  net  from several financing activities  including the private placement of  shares of common stock and  shares of series d stock  and from employee stock option exercises 
in january  the company also received million from abbott representing the fourth and final installment of prepayments against future incremental cartridge sales as defined in the distribution agreement with abbott 
the increase in cash from financing activities was offset by approximately million of cash used in operating activities net of the receipt of million from abbott in january and equipment purchases of approximately million 
working capital increased by approximately million from million to million during changes in working capital during the year primarily reflect the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  a reduction of approximately million in inventories  an increase of million in other current assets due to the timing of the receipt of cash related to the sale of new jersey state income tax benefits under the program  and a decrease in current deferred revenue of million related to the incremental cartridge sales prepayment earned by abbott in  offset by an increase of approximately million in the net amount of related party accounts payable and accounts receivable 
during the first quarter of each year under the abbott distribution agreement  the company and abbott conduct a reconciliation of the annual prepayments made by abbott against future incremental cartridge sales 
the reconciliation for resulted in a credit due to abbott of approximately million 
as a result of this credit due to abbott at december   the net balance is a liability in the amount of million comprised of gross receivables of million offset by a credit balance owed to abbott of million and is classified as accounts payable to related party within short term liabilities 
the company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet its obligations and its liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  numerous factors may change this expectation  including the results of its marketing and sales activities  its new product development efforts  manufacturing difficulties  manufacturing efficiencies and plant expansion plans  competitive conditions and long term strategic decisions including the continuation or termination of the abbott alliance 
the company regularly monitors capital raising alternatives in order to take advantage of opportunities to supplement its current working capital upon favorable terms  including joint ventures  strategic corporate partnerships or other alliances and the sale of equity and or debt securities 
the company does not have any debt or capital leases 
on march   agilent technologies  inc converted and sold its holding of  shares of the company s series b preferred stock formerly held by hewlett packard company into  shares of common stock and accordingly  is no longer a related party for financial statement purposes 
at december   the company had available for federal income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in varying amounts through the timing and manner in which the operating loss carryforwards are utilized in any year by the company may be limited by section of the internal revenue code 
given that significant uncertainty exists regarding the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  a full valuation allowance is recorded 
international sales are invoiced and paid in us dollars 
however  the cartridge price received from international partners  including abbott  may be affected by changes in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies because the price paid by customers to the company s partners is set in local currencies 
when the value of foreign currencies changes with respect to the us dollar  the price paid by the company s partners to the company changes due to the foreign exchange conversion of local currency prices 
however  price reductions may be limited by guaranteed us dollar minimum prices established for each cartridge 
the company s cartridge manufacturing is conducted through i stat canada 
most manufacturing labor and overhead costs of this subsidiary are incurred in canadian dollars  while some raw material purchases are made in us dollars 
the canadian operation is primarily funded by payments in us dollars made by the us parent company for cartridges purchased for resale to its customers 
in  the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation increased by approximately million to approximately million  and reflects the adjustment to translate the canadian subsidiary s balance sheet to us dollars at the december  exchange rate 
since most of the cartridge manufacturing expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  the cost of products sold and therefore  the company s consolidated results of operations and cash flows can be impacted by a change in exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
the impact of inflation on the company s business has been minimal and is expected to be minimal for the near term 
financings concluded in in august  the company closed a million private placement with several institutional investors 
in this financing the company issued  shares of common stock at per share   shares of series c stock at  per share  and six year warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share the series c warrants 
the series c warrants are callable by the company if the closing price of the company s common stock is greater than for ten consecutive business days 
if the company calls the series c warrants  then the company must issue replacement warrants of equal quantity at a strike price of and with a term equal to the remaining term on the initial series c warrants 
at the time of issuance the series c stock was deemed to have a beneficial conversion feature because the conversion price of the series c stock would reflect a twelve percent discount to the fair market value of the common stock 
the beneficial conversion feature was calculated on august   the commitment date  and was approximately million 
the beneficial conversion feature was accreted into the series c stock from the date of issuance through november  in december  the company elected to redeem all outstanding shares of series c stock at their face value  thus leaving no series c stock outstanding 
as a result of the redemption of the series c stock  approximately million was returned to the holders and series c warrants representing  shares of common stock were cancelled 
as a result of the redemption of the series c stock  the accretion related to the beneficial conversion feature of million was reversed 
thus  the company s consolidated statements of operations does not include any accretion related to the beneficial conversion feature of the series c stock 
in december  as a result of the issuance of the series d stock see below  and pursuant to applicable anti dilution provisions  the series c warrants were adjusted from  shares of common stock at a strike price of per share  to  shares at a strike price of per share 
in december  the company closed a million private placement with affiliates of cerberus capital management  lp collectively  cerberus 
in this financing  the company issued  shares of series d stock with a stated value of  per share and an preferential dividend and six year warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share the series d warrants 
the series d stock is mandatorily redeemable in december and may be redeemed by the company any time after december at a price equal to the stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series d stock may be converted into common stock at the holders option at a conversion price of per share of common stock  subject to certain ownership level restrictions described below and subject to customary anti dilution protection adjustments 
at the closing of the issuance of series d stock  such shares were convertible into million shares of the company s common stock without giving effect to the ownership level restrictions 
this number increases to the extent that the company elects to accrue the dividend 
no holder of the series d stock and series d warrants may convert or exercise its securities into shares of the company s common stock if after the conversion  such holder  together with any of its affiliates  would beneficially own over the ownership limitation percentage set by the company  initially 
under certain circumstances  the restrictions for cerberus may be eased so that it will be entitled to convert or exercise its securities into shares of common stock if after the conversion it does not beneficially own in excess of of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
these restrictions are eased as certain restrictions on abbott s ownership levels ease or terminate 
absent these limitations  cerberus current ownership would represent the right to acquire approximately of the outstanding voting securities of the company at december  these limitations do not prevent the holders from acquiring and selling shares of the company s common stock within these limitations 
cerberus is entitled to appoint one person to the company s board of directors for so long as it holds of the outstanding securities of the company on a fully diluted basis 
holders of the series d stock have a right of first refusal to participate in certain financings proposed to be consummated by the company for so long as such holders hold at least of the fully diluted securities of the company outstanding immediately after the closing of the series d financing 
holders of the series d stock are entitled to receive a cumulative dividend of of the liquidation preference  payable quarterly 
the dividends may be paid in cash  or accrue and be added to the liquidation preference  becoming payable in cash upon redemption or payable in common stock upon conversion 
during the periods that the common stock trades at or above per share for consecutive trading days  the dividend rate will be reduced to  and if during subsequent periods the common stock trades below per share for consecutive trading days  the dividend rate will adjust back to 
at december   the liquidation preference amount of the series d stock is million  comprised of the stated value of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends of approximately million  and the series d stock is convertible into approximately million shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share of common stock 
alliance with abbott laboratories on september   the company and abbott entered into agreements the alliance agreements providing for a long term sales  marketing and research alliance 
the alliance agreements comprise a distribution agreement  a research agreement  a stock purchase agreement  a standstill agreement and a registration rights agreement 
distribution under the distribution agreement commenced in the united states on november  a subsequent international rollout commenced in various countries during the second half of as a result of the distribution agreement  the majority of the company s revenues are now derived from abbott 
the primary objective of the abbott alliance was to strengthen the company s product marketing and distribution capability and accelerate the development of new products 
under the distribution agreement  abbott has become  subject to the then existing rights of the company s other international distributors  the exclusive worldwide distributor of the company s hand held blood analyzer products including cartridges and any new products the company may develop for use in the professionally attended human healthcare delivery market 
abbott has assumed the company s product sales to us customers that were in place as of the inception of the distribution agreement the base business at no profit to abbott  and the company and abbott share in the incremental profits derived from product sales beyond the base business 
abbott agreed to prepay to the company a total of  during the first three years of the distribution agreement against future incremental product sales 
such prepayments are amortized to revenue as incremental cartridges are sold to abbott over the first three years of the agreement 
prepayments in amounts of    and  were received in september  january  january and january  respectively 
unamortized revenue relating to these prepayments in the amounts of  and  are included in deferred revenues  current at december  and  respectively  and  is included in deferred revenues from related party  non current at december  the  will be recognized in the company s income if abbott unilaterally terminates the distribution agreement 
if the company unilaterally terminates the distribution agreement without cause as defined  the company will be obligated to repay the  to abbott upon termination of the distribution agreement 
the distribution agreement expires on december   subject to automatic extensions for additional one year periods unless either party provides the other with at least months prior written notice  except that the company may terminate the distribution agreement after december  if abbott fails to achieve a three year milestone minimum growth rate in sales of the company s products in the us covered by the distribution agreement 
abbott has advised the company that it has reached the minimum three year growth rate milestone and the company agrees that the milestone has been met 
if the distribution agreement is terminated  other than i by the company for cause  or ii by abbott  if abbott delivers the requisite notice terminating the distribution agreement after the initial term  then  the company will be obligated to pay to abbott a a one time termination fee calculated to compensate abbott for a portion of its costs in undertaking the distribution relationship  b an additional  of unamortized revenue related to the  in prepayments made by abbott against incremental product sales  and c residual payments for five years following termination based on a declining percentage of abbott s net sales of the company s products during the final twelve months of the distribution agreement 
the company expects that such payments would have a material impact on its cash flows and results of operations 
the company currently is evaluating whether or not to seek an extension of the distribution agreement after if the distribution agreement is terminated  the company must take steps that it deems appropriate or necessary to resume primary responsibility for the marketing and sales of its products 
this includes hiring additional marketing and sales personnel and allocating resources to this endeavor 
under the terms of the research agreement  the company is required to conduct research and develop products primarily to be commercialized by abbott 
such research and development is to be funded by abbott and abbott will have exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the products developed under the research agreement subject to certain limitations 
the company and abbott will jointly own the intellectual property that is developed during the course of work performed under the research agreement 
in connection with this agreement  reimbursements from abbott of  and  are included in net revenues in and  respectively 
there were no research and development reimbursements from abbott in and abbott is not currently funding any of the company s research and development programs 
the research agreement terminates upon expiration or termination of the distribution agreement  unless earlier terminated as provided therein 
upon such expiration or earlier termination  both the company and abbott will be permitted to distribute the products developed under the research agreement in the territory covered by the distribution agreement 
under the stock purchase agreement  abbott purchased  shares the purchased shares of the company s common stock  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of  the stock purchase agreement  together with the registration rights agreement  contains certain terms and conditions pertaining to the voting and transfer of the purchased shares 
the standstill agreement provides for limitations on abbott s ability to purchase the company s common stock  or to propose any merger or business combination with the company or purchase of a material portion of the company s assets for a period of one year following the termination of the initial term of the distribution agreement 
the foregoing description of the alliance agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual text of such agreements  copies of which were filed with the commission as exhibits to the company s quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june  critical accounting policies and estimates i stat s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon i stat s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires i stat to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  i stat evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
i stat bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
i stat believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenues from the sale of products are recorded when the product is shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the purchaser and payment terms are fixed or determinable 
revenues from service contracts are recognized when performance of the service is complete or over the term of the contract 
i stat values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
i stat reviews its inventory for quantities in excess of production requirements  obsolescence and for compliance with the company s quality specifications 
any adjustments to inventory would be equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
i stat records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while i stat has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event i stat were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the company establishes liabilities for litigation and contingencies when the matters become probable and the amount of the potential liability is reasonably estimable 
the company generally will consult with its outside legal counsel  assess the merits of the claim  evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and consider the range of potential losses in reaching its conclusion
