item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all statements  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue  gross margins and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  and intend and other similar expressions constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to those discussed in cautionary statements as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this annual report on form k 
overview we research  develop  manufacture  market  sell and service lasers used to perform aesthetic and cosmetic procedures 
we sell our lasers principally to medical practitioners 
candela markets its products directly and through a network of distributors to end users 
our traditional customer base includes plastic and cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists 
more recently  we have expanded our sales to a broader group of practitioners consisting of general practitioners and certain specialists including obstetricians  gynecologists  and general and vascular surgeons 
we derive our revenue from the sale of lasers and other products  the provision of product related services  and the operations of our skin care center 
domestic and international product sales are generated principally through our direct sales force based in the us and seven international offices 
prior to fiscal  a relatively small portion of our sales came through our network of independent distributors 
in december  we entered into an exclusive distributorship arrangement with physician sales and service pss 
sales to distributors for the years ended june  and july   increased as a result of this arrangement 
in fiscal year  we announced our decision to terminate our relationship with pss and use a direct sales force to service the sales channels previously serviced by that distributor 
we typically assemble products in our wayland  massachusetts  facility in the quarter in which they are shipped  and backlog has not been significant 
we experience some seasonal reduction of our product sales in the quarter ending in september due to the summer holiday schedule of physicians and their patients 
all product shipments include a standard month parts and service warranty except for vbeam products which include a standard year warranty 
the anticipated cost associated with the warranty coverage is accrued at the time of shipment as a cost of sales charged to product related service costs 
any costs associated with product installation are also recognized as costs of product related service 
both such anticipated and actual costs have no associated revenue and therefore reduce the gross profit from product related service revenue 
product related service revenue consists of revenue from maintenance and repair services and the sale of spare parts and consumables 
we derive revenue from extended service contracts  which are typically for a or month period  and the revenue is initially deferred and recognized over the life of the service contract 
in addition  we provide on site service worldwide on a time and materials basis directly or through our distributors 
in june  we began an effort to own and operate skin care centers offering cosmetic laser treatments utilizing our equipment  along with providing other cosmetic services traditionally offered by high end spas 
we pursued this strategy by purchasing an existing spa in boston in and by opening a new skin care center in scottsdale  arizona in march we subsequently decided to reduce our focus on our skin care center efforts and to renew our commitment to our core aesthetic and cosmetic laser business 
during fiscal  we closed the scottsdale facility because it had failed to generate any material revenue  recorded a restructuring charge  and established a reserve in the amount of million representing the anticipated cost associated with this closure  less assumed future sublease payments 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of  as no sub lessee had been located for the facility 
during fiscal  the scottsdale property was subleased and the restructuring charge was reversed by  in january  we ceased to offer aesthetic laser procedures at our boston skin care center  but we continue to provide personal care and health and beauty services from this location 
we are actively seeking buyers to assume the lease and purchase the assets of the boston facility 
during the quarter ended june   the company determined that impairment indicators existed relating to its skin care health spa services 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company evaluated the recoverability of its spa related long lived assets  and determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of the spa related long lived assets at june  accordingly  the company charged off all remaining undepreciated long lived spa related assets of approximately  international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  france  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  during the fiscal years ended june   june   and july  represented  and of total sales  respectively 
our fiscal year consists of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to june of each year 
the years ended june   june  and july  each contained weeks 
significant accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our customers and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions  pursuant to the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
as of june   our accounts receivable balance of  is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  we believe our reported allowances at june   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances  which would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
as of june   our inventory of  is stated net of inventory reserves of  if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory reserves may be required 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability at june   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
the company assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company records charges for the costs it anticipates incurring in connection with litigation and claims against the company when management can reasonably estimate these costs 
restructuring 
the company records restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect management s commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
results of operations the following tables set forth selected financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as percentages 
for the year ended june  june  july  consolidated statement of operations data revenue mix lasers and other products product related service skin care centers total revenue operating ratios gross profit lasers and other products product related service skin care centers total gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income from operations total other income expense income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue 
total revenue declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  france and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  was of total revenue for fiscal in comparison to for fiscal laser and product revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal lower unit sales of the gentlelase r and alexlazr tm products contributed approximately million to the decrease in product sales from fiscal to but were offset by an increase in vbeam r unit sales of approximately million and an increase in smoothbeam tm sales of million 
product related service revenue remained relatively constant at million in fiscal and million in fiscal skin care center revenue decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in  due primarily to decreases in customer traffic 
we expect that increases in unit sales of vbeam r  smoothbeam tm and c beam tm products will outpace continued declines in average selling prices and unit volumes of the gentlelase r and alexlazr tm products during fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal mainly as a result of increased warranty costs associated with the vbeam products and the decline in margins at the skin care center 
gross profit on lasers and other products decreased slightly from million or in fiscal to million or in fiscal gross profit for product related service revenue in fiscal decreased to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for fiscal the decrease in product related service gross profit is due primarily to increased warranty costs associated with the vbeam products 
the increase in vbeam warranty costs was largely due to the one time replacement of a component of the system and these costs are not expected to reoccur in fiscal skin care center gross profit for fiscal year decreased to million or of revenue in comparison to million or of revenue for fiscal year resulting from a combination of a decrease in the number of services performed and the sale of retail inventory at reduced margins 
research and development expense 
research and development spending for fiscal decreased to million  from million for fiscal the decrease in research and development expense reflects reductions in personnel and other cost cutting initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal an aggressive commission plan to rebuild our domestic sales force contributed approximately million to the increase in selling expenses in fiscal over fiscal an increase of  for bad debt expense related to the pss dispute  and a  increase in market studies also contributed to higher general and administrative costs in fiscal over fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal impairment charge 
during the quarter ended june   the company determined that impairment indicators existed relating to its skin care health spa services 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company evaluated the recoverability of its spa related long lived assets 
the company determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of the spa related long lived assets at june  accordingly  the company wrote off as selling  general and administrative expense all remaining spa related long lived assets  principally leasehold improvements  of  restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended december   a restructuring charge was recorded and a reserve established in the amount of million  which assumed a sublease of the premises  resulting from the closure of the skin care center located in scottsdale  arizona 
during fiscal  we incurred an additional charge of million because we had been unable to sublease the property 
during fiscal  we secured a sublease for the property and reversed the restructuring reserve by  which represents the future sublease payments to be received from the sublessee 
other income expense 
for the fiscal year ended june   total other income declined to million from million for the fiscal year ended june  interest income decreased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower levels of cash invested at lower interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by a  gain arising from the effects of currency fluctuations 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the company 
the company recorded a effective tax rate for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june   in which the company recorded a tax rate 
the benefit from income taxes for the year ended june   includes a tax benefit for taxable losses in the us offset by a tax provision calculated for taxable income generated in japan and spain at rates in excess of the us statutory tax rate 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended july  revenue 
total revenue declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  france and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  was of total revenue for fiscal in comparison to for fiscal laser and product revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due to a shortfall in the second quarter of fiscal  caused by a lack of orders from a major us distributor  combined with a decline in the average selling price of the gentlelase tm  our highest volume selling laser 
product related service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to increased shipments of consumables used with our vbeam r  gentlelase r  and smoothbeam tm products as well as an increase in the sale of extended service contracts 
skin care center revenue increased to million in fiscal compared to million in  due to increased marketing and promotional activities for our boston spa 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal mainly as a result of an increase in sales discounts  effects of a fluctuating foreign currency market  and sales of lower margin systems  in comparison to sales of higher margin gentlelase r and vbeam r systems during fiscal gross profit on lasers and other products decreased to million or in fiscal compared to million or in fiscal gross profit for product related service revenue in fiscal slightly increased to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for fiscal skin care center gross profit for fiscal year increased to million or of revenue in comparison to million or of revenue for fiscal year resulting from a combination of an increased number of services and emphasis placed on cost control within the center 
research and development expense 
research and development spending for fiscal increased to million  from million for fiscal the increase in research and development expense reflects efforts to develop new products such as the smoothbeam tm and the c beam tm 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase reflects substantial marketing expenditures incurred to support the launches of new lasers  combined with legal expenses due to litigation settlements throughout the first half of the year 
selling costs increased due to sponsoring preceptorships for future clientele 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal impairment charge 
during the quarter ended june   the company determined that impairment indicators existed relating to its skin care health spa services 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company evaluated the recoverability of its spa related long lived assets 
the company determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of the spa related long lived assets at june  accordingly  the company wrote off as selling  general and administrative expense all remaining spa related long lived assets  principally leasehold improvements  of  restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended december   a restructuring charge was recorded and a reserve established in the amount of million  which assumed a sublease of the premises  resulting from the closure of the skin care center located in scottsdale  arizona 
during fiscal  we incurred an additional charge of million due to a change in future sublease payments 
other income expense 
for the fiscal years ended june  and july   total other income remained constant at million 
interest income increased due to high levels of cash invested and was offset by losses arising from the effects of currency fluctuations  in particular  the japanese yen 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the company 
the company recorded a effective tax rate for the year ended june   compared to the year ended july   in which the company recorded a tax rate due to reductions in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources cash used by operating activities amounted to million for fiscal compared to cash generated by operations of million for fiscal cash used in operating activities reflects the effects of a net loss for fiscal combined with an increase in accounts receivable balances and decreases in accounts payable balances as compared to fiscal cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal resulting from a decrease in capital expenditures made to support our implementation of oracle erp software 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million in in comparison to million for this use of cash is due to an increase in the number of shares repurchased on the open market during the two fiscal years 
the company also made principal payments on its long term debt in the amount of  during fiscal on october   we issued eight year  subordinated term notes to three investors in the aggregate amount of million  secured by the company s assets 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to the note holders that have an exercise price of per warrant  which yield shares of common stock 
the relative fair value ascribed to the warrants was  and was recorded as a component of additional paid in capital in stockholders equity 
the relative fair value of the debt was recorded as  the debt is being accreted to face value using the interest method over eight years  which will result in interest expense of  over the eight year period in addition to the stated interest rate 
as of june   a total of  has been accreted to the notes  resulting in a long term liability balance of million and a short term balance of  furthermore  a total of  of interest expense has been recorded in fiscal year in connection with these notes 
the notes  which become due in october  require quarterly interest payments and permit early repayment with a decreasing penalty percentage through october  given the lower current interest rates and the rate on the loan  the company is giving consideration to repaying the entire debt as of november  if the company were to take advantage of the early repayment option on november   we would be required to accrete the remaining debt balance at that time  resulting in a non cash interest expense of  we would also be required to pay a cash penalty of  and the outstanding principal balance of million 
such a repayment would result in cash interest expense savings of  over the remaining term of debt net of the cash penalty 
the note agreement contains restrictive covenants establishing maximum leverage  certain minimum ratios  and minimum levels of net income 
as of june   the company is in violation of minimum net worth levels  for which a waiver has been received for the fourth quarter of fiscal outstanding contractual obligations of the company are reflected in the following table in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt   operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     the company also maintains a renewable  revolving credit agreement with a major bank with interest at the bank s base rate 
any borrowings outstanding under the line of credit are due on demand or according to a payment schedule established at the time funds are borrowed 
the line of credit is unsecured 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants limiting the establishment of new liens  and the purchase of margin stock 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit as of june  we believe that cash balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements 
however  we cannot be sure that we will not require additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us  nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  as it becomes required 
cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements concerning the future of the industry  product development  business strategy including the possibility of future acquisitions  anticipated operational and capital expenditure levels  continued acceptance and growth of our products  and dependence on significant customers and suppliers 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that we have made based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  operations  and prospects  not historical facts 
we have made these forward looking statements pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue or other similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  and may contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward looking information 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this annual report on form k 
the cautionary statements noted below and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form k could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward looking statement 
we may not update or publicly release the results of these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
because we derive more than half of our revenue from international sales  including approximately one third of our revenue from japan and the asia pacific marketplace in fiscal  we are susceptible to currency fluctuations  negative economic changes taking place in japan and the asia pacific marketplace  and other risks associated with conducting business overseas 
we sell more than half of our products and services outside the us and canada 
international sales  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  france and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  accounted for of our revenue for fiscal year  and we expect that they will continue to be significant 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales 
in particular  significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability  or could cause prospective customers to push out orders to later dates because of the increased relative cost of our products in the aftermath of a currency devaluation or currency fluctuation 
other risks associated with international sales that we currently face or have faced in the past include o longer payment cycles common in foreign markets o failure to obtain or significant delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign regulatory approvals for our products o difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 
the failure to obtain alexandrite rods for the gentlelase r from our sole supplier would impair our ability to manufacture and sell gentlelase r 
we use alexandrite rods to manufacture the gentlelase r  which accounts for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we depend exclusively on litton airtron synoptics to supply these rods  for which no alternative supplier meeting our quality standards exists 
we cannot be certain that litton will be able to meet our future requirements at current prices or at all 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of alexandrite rods in a timely manner  but any extended interruption in our supplies could hurt our results 
disappointing quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may swing sharply from quarter to quarter 
historically  our first fiscal quarter has typically had the least amount of revenue in any quarter of our fiscal year 
the results of the first quarter are directly impacted by the seasonality of the purchasing cycle 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for many reasons  some of which are outside of our control  including the following market supply and demand o potential increases in the level and intensity of price competition between our competitors and us o potential decrease in demand for our products o possible delays in market acceptance of our new products 
customer behavior o changes in or extensions of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles o changes in the timing of product sales in anticipation of new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors 
company operations o absence of significant product backlogs o our effectiveness in our manufacturing process o unsatisfactory performance of our distribution channels  service providers  or customer support organizations o timing of any acquisitions and related costs 
the cost of closing our remaining skin care center may be higher than management has estimated to date  and higher actual costs would negatively impact our operating results 
we have renewed our commitment to expand and diversify our core cosmetic and surgical laser equipment business 
as part of this refocus  we decided to reduce our focus on our efforts to own and operate centers which would offer cosmetic laser treatments utilizing our equipment  along with providing other cosmetic services traditionally offered by high end spas 
although we are actively seeking a buyer for our skin care center in boston  massachusetts  we cannot be certain that a sale or sublease of the facility will be completed on favorable terms or at all 
we have established a reserve to accrue for the anticipated costs of terminating the skin care center in scottsdale  arizona 
during fiscal  we were able to secure a sub lease of this facility and consequently reversed a portion of the reserve to account for future lease payments being made by the sub lessee 
our failure to respond to rapid changes in technology and intense competition in the laser industry could make our lasers obsolete 
the aesthetic and cosmetic laser equipment industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations 
to be successful  we must be responsive to new developments in laser technology and new applications of existing technology 
our financial condition and operating results could be hurt if our products fail to compete favorably in response to such technological developments  or we are not agile in responding to competitors new product introductions or product price reductions 
in addition  we compete against numerous companies offering products similar to ours  some of which have greater financial  marketing  and technical resources than we do 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies and our failure to do so could hurt our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
like other companies in our industry  we are subject to a regulatory review process and our failure to receive necessary government clearances or approvals could affect our ability to sell our products and remain competitive 
the types of medical devices that we seek to market in the us generally must receive either k clearance or pma approval in advance from the us food and drug administration fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
to date  the fda has deemed our products eligible for the k clearance process 
we believe that most of our products in development will receive similar treatment 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will not impose the more burdensome pma approval process upon one or more of our future products  nor can we be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market 
many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the fda 
particularly  for example  we are awaiting ministry of health approval in japan for the sale of the vbeam r 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or continue to obtain any such government approvals or successfully comply with any such foreign regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we have modified some of our products without fda clearance 
the fda could retroactively decide the modifications were improper and require us to cease marketing and or recall the modified products 
any modification to one of our k cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision 
we have modified some of our marketed devices  but we believe that new k clearances are not required 
we cannot be certain that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance 
achieving complete compliance with fda regulations is difficult  and if we fail to comply  we could be subject to fda enforcement action 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda s regulatory scheme is complex  especially the quality system regulation qsr  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures 
this complexity makes complete compliance difficult to achieve 
also  the determination as to whether a qsr violation has occurred is often subjective 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with the qsr or other applicable requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  including a public warning letter or other stronger remedies  such as o fines  injunctions  and civil penalties against us o recall or seizure of our products o operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of our production o refusing our requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products o withdrawing product approvals already granted o criminal prosecution claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non infringing technology 
our industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the us until such patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a period of time outside the us accordingly  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications of others 
any claims of patent infringement would be time consuming and could o result in costly litigation o divert our technical and management personnel o cause product shipment delays o require us to develop non infringing technology o require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the laser industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could hurt our gross margins 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or the failure to obtain necessary licenses  could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products  which could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
on the other hand  we may have to start costly and time consuming litigation in order to enforce our patents  to protect trade secrets  and know how owned by us or to determine the enforceability  scope  and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims 
there are various risks of physical injury to the patient when using our lasers for aesthetic and cosmetic treatments 
injuries often result in product liability or other claims being brought against the practitioner utilizing the device and us 
the costs and management time we would have to spend in defending or settling any such claims  or the payment of any award in connection with such claims  could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that our policy will provide sufficient coverage for any claim or claims that may arise  or that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on favorable economic terms 
we may be unable to attract and retain management and other personnel we need to succeed 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key research  development  sales  and marketing personnel  particularly if lost to competitors  could hurt our future operating results 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we cannot be certain that we will attract  retain  and motivate sufficient numbers of such personnel 
our failure to manage future acquisitions and joint ventures effectively may divert management attention from our core business and cause us to incur additional debt  liabilities or costs 
we may acquire businesses  products  and technologies that complement or expand our business 
we may also consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects 
we may not be able to o identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates o successfully negotiate  finance  or integrate any businesses  products  or technologies that we acquire o successfully manage any joint ventures or collaborations 
furthermore  the integration of any acquisition or joint venture may divert management time and resources 
if we fail to manage these acquisitions or joint ventures effectively  we may incur debts or other liabilities or costs which could harm our operating results or financial condition 
while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products  and technologies  consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects  and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations  we have no present understandings  commitments  or agreements with respect to any acquisitions or joint ventures
