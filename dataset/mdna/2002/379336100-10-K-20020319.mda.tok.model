at december   the company was in compliance with its credit facility 
the company s title xi bonds mature in   and the bonds carry interest rates of   and per annum  respectively  and require aggregate semi annual payments of million  plus interest

for flexibility  the company maintains a shelf registration statement that permits the issuance of up to million of debt and equity securities 
industry outlook although the events of september  have caused demand for energy to decrease and oil and gas prices to become more volatile  we continue to be optimistic about our future prospects 
in light of these changes in the business environment and the adverse effect they could possibly have on our business  we are continuing to actively monitor our business and make the appropriate business changes when deemed necessary

 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also requires the recording of all acquired intangible assets that arise either from contractual or legal rights  or that are separable from the acquired entity 
the company adopted this accounting standard effective july   as required and it had no impact on the company s financial position 
in july   fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will cease upon adoption of this statement 
goodwill amortization in was approximately million 
as sfas no 
allows  the company will complete the required impairment test in the second quarter of the company has not determined the impact that this statement will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company will adopt sfas no 
beginning january  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires the recording of liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the normal operation of those assets 
these liabilities are required to be recorded at their fair values which are likely to be the present values of the estimated future cash flows in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
requires the associated asset retirement costs to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the asset retirement obligation will be accreted each year through a charge to expense 
the amounts added to the carrying amounts of the assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
the company is required to implement sfas no 
on january   and we have not determined the impact that this statement will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  promulgates standards for measuring and recording impairments of long lived assets 
additionally  this standard establishes requirements for classifying an asset as held for sale  and changes existing accounting and reporting standards for discontinued operations and exchanges for long lived assets 
the company is required to implement sfas no 
on january   and does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
significant accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenues from construction contracts  which are typically of short duration  are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect vessel costs  labor  supplies  and repairs 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
selling  general  and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
significant changes in cost estimates due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values can be recovered through projected net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over their remaining lives 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
in  the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements  which effectively modified the interest characteristics of million of its outstanding long term debt 
the agreements involve the exchange of a variable interest rate of libor plus for amounts based on fixed interest rates of between to plus 
these swaps have maturities between five to seventeen months 
these transactions were entered into in the normal course of business primarily to hedge rising interest rates 
the estimated fair market value of the interest rate swap based on quoted market prices was million as of december  a hypothetical basis point decrease in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of this instrument 
interest on approximately million  or of the company s long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of at december   was variable  based on short term market rates 
thus  a general increase of in short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of million per year if the company were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
also  the company has approximately million fixed interest rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately and a market value of approximately million on december  a general increase of in overall market interest rates would result in a decline in market value of the debt to approximately million 
the company uses natural hedging techniques to hedge against foreign currency exchange losses by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
the company also  to the extent possible  maintains cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
the company does not believe that a change in currency rates in the regions that it operates would have a significant effect on its results of operations
