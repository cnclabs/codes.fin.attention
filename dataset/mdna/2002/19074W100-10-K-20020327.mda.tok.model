as a primary licensee of the bluecross blueshield association bca  cobalt is required to maintain a prescribed liquidity ratio of certain liquid assets to average monthly expenses  as defined  in accordance with licensure requirements of the bca 
bcbsuw and compcare are both considered larger controlled affiliate licensees by the bca and must also adhere to these requirements 
bcbsuw and compcare maintained these required levels as of december  cobalt s investment portfolio consists primarily of investment grade bonds and government securities and has a limited exposure to equity securities

wisconsin insurers are also subject to compulsory and security surplus requirements based upon the amount and type of premiums written

cobalt  bcbsuw and compcare are in compliance with these requirements as of december  in order to satisfy certain intercompany receivables and continue to comply with minimum capital and licensing standards  management has considered selling certain subsidiaries  as well as some portion or all of its investment in american medical security group  inc  or obtaining capital from outside sources 
included in the statutory capital of certain insurance subsidiaries of cobalt are particular interests in  or obligations of  affiliates 
united wisconsin insurance company a wholly owned subsidiary of compcare carries as an admitted asset an intercompany secured note from cobalt in the amount of million payable by october  bcbsuw also carries a million secured note obligation from cobalt payable january  subsequent to year end  the maturity date on the million note was extended to january  management s plan during the three years in the period ended december   the company incurred operating losses aggregating million 
included in these losses are million related to the company s participation in the medicare risk line of business  which the company exited effective january  prior to the combination  uws and its subsidiaries incurred additional operating losses aggregating million for the first quarter of and the two years ended december  these losses largely relate to the hmo business in southeast wisconsin 
significant actions were taken during to cancel unprofitable hmo business 
also contributing to the combined aggregate losses were million of expenses relating to the combination 
on a pro forma basis  cobalt s operating income for was a gain of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
despite these recent operating losses and the implementation of changes in statutory accounting codification effective january   the company complied with minimum capital and liquidity requirements of the office of the commissioner of insurance of the state of wisconsin oci during  and the company maintained compliance  in part  by contributing regulated and non regulated subsidiaries to regulated entities and by collateralizing certain intra company debt obligations with the common stock of affiliated entities 
oci requested and management submitted a specific plan of action to continue to exceed the minimum capital requirements of the oci and the bca during the outstanding common stock of compcare  unity  valley and uhi currently provide the collateral for approximately million borrowed by cobalt from bcbsuw and uwic 
these intra company balances have been eliminated in the accompanying december  consolidated balance sheet 
however  the intra company balances continue to be an obligation of cobalt to bcbsuw million and uwic million in the statutory basis financial statements of bcbsuw and uwic 
cobalt is obligated to repay bcbsuw by january  and uwic by october  transfer of the pledged collateral to bcbsuw and uwic will satisfy the legal obligations  but would not assist bcbsuw in complying with minimum capital and liquidity requirements  since the minimum capital calculations for investments in subsidiaries require a greater discount than for cash  marketable securities or affiliated receivables 
however  settlement of these obligations in cash will assist compliance with minimum capital and liquidity requirements 
at december   all of the company s subsidiaries are accounted for in the bcbsuw or compcare capital calculations as a result of contribution or collateralization 
in order to assure the company s regulated insurance subsidiaries continue to satisfy minimum capital and liquidity requirements  the oci requested  management developed and cobalt s board of directors approved a capital plan to improve the company s position relative to minimum capital and liquidity requirements 
the capital plan  which management has provided to and discussed with the oci and bca  includes the following action steps to maintain required capital and liquidity levels during sell certain non regulated subsidiaries owned by the company for cash and or notes prior to october  reduce bcbsuw s investment in amsg common stock from of the shares outstanding to less than through public or private offerings during obtain debt financing at the company s corporate holding company from one or more institutional lenders to fund holding company liquidity needs including the repayment of the collateralized intra company debt obligations between the holding company and its regulated subsidiaries 
achieve the company s projected core earnings  which anticipate breakeven operating results for compcare for the year ending december  as compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  
management expects compcare s significant change in profitability to occur as a result of efforts in the fourth quarter of to cancel unprofitable business and implement necessary premium increases for the remaining business 
adhere to certain practices in conducting and accounting for affiliated transactions  notably involving the lending practices previously described 
the company will not use uncollateralized non operating intra company balances in complying with minimum capital and liquidity requirements 
the company has reflected the revised practices in the december  regulated subsidiary statutory basis financial statements filed with the oci and other regulatory agencies 
satisfy the million debt obligation to bcbsuw by december   either with cash obtained through external financing or by transferring the stock of compcare to bcbsuw or a combination thereof 
satisfy the million debt obligation to uwic by september   either with cash obtained through external financing or by transferring the stock of unity  valley and uhi to uwic 
the company expects to remain in compliance with minimum capital and liquidity requirements of the oci and the bca throughout by substantially completing the capital plan described above or transactions with an equivalent impact on the company s position relative to minimum capital and liquidity requirements 
non compliance with minimum capital and liquidity requirements may subject the company to various regulatory actions by the oci and bca  including rehabilitation  revocation of the company s license to sell insurance products in wisconsin and revocation of the company s license to operate as a blue cross blue shield franchisee 
see cautionary factors 
inflation health care costs have been rising and are expected to continue to rise at a rate that exceeds the consumer price index 
the company s cost control measures  risk sharing incentive arrangements with medical care providers  and premium rate increases are designed to reduce the adverse effect of medical cost inflation on its operations 
in addition  the company utilizes its ability to apply appropriate underwriting criteria in selecting groups and individuals and in controlling the utilization of health care services 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will fully offset the impact of inflation or that premium revenue increases will equal or exceed increasing health care costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  impairment of equity method investments  goodwill impairment  medical and other benefits payables  and litigation and tax contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts a significant portion of the company s receivable balances result from balances due from employers  individuals  and providers of medical services 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments or retroactivity in reporting membership cancellations 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or if significant employee turnover were to occur among insured employers  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax assets the company recorded a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets as of december  and management deemed that a full valuation allowance was appropriate based on the company s history of losses and changes in tax planning strategies post combination 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or reduce recorded goodwill in the period such determination was made 
impairment of equity method investments the company s investment in amsg is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
at december  the company owned  shares of the outstanding common stock ownership of amsg 
the company s per share carrying value as of december  was based on the company s share of amsg s equity 
pursuant to current gaap  the company wrote down its investment in amsg to the current market value as of december  of such stock due to the company s evaluation and announcement that its holdings in amsg no longer represented a strategic investment and that the company planned an orderly reduction of its ownership 
although any market write downs are charged to operations  any subsequent increases in the market value after a market writedown are not reflected in the financial statements of the company until full disposition of the shares occurs or the company s ownership percentage is reduced to below 
goodwill impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors to determine the accountability of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues  based on fair values  during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
medical and other benefits payables the amount of medical and other benefits payables the loss reserves is determined based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information eg  medical cost index 
the estimation process requires the company to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims  on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about the emerging trends  the company develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions  which vary by class of business  used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
the company also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
because the amount of the loss reserves is sensitive to assumptions  the company does not totally rely on a single estimate to determine the loss reserve 
to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by the company s loss estimation process  the company develops several estimates using generally recognized actuarial projection methodologies that result in a range of reasonably possible loss reserve outcomes that are used to challenge the company s best estimate 
the company will continue to closely monitor these developments to ensure that its conclusions on the impact are appropriate 
should other trends emerge  the company would react accordingly which could result in upward adjustments to its reserves 
another factor that can significantly impact the loss reserve estimate is the impact of legislative changes in health care  court resolutions and judicial interpretations 
the company only factors into its assumptions actual legislative changes  court rulings and interpretations 
therefore  the loss reserve estimates made can be significantly impacted by future legislative actions  rulings or interpretations 
litigation and tax contingencies the company and its affiliates are involved in various legal actions occurring in the normal course of business 
in the opinion of management  adequate provision has been made for losses  which may result from these actions 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
in addition  the company has made no accruals for outstanding litigation in which management believes that the company will prevail 
as of december   the company has accrued its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel that is handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
certain litigation is being addressed before juries in states where past jury awards have been significant 
to the extent additional information arises or strategies change  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
the company recognizes the costs of legal defense in the periods incurred 
accordingly  the future costs of defending claims are not included in the company s estimated liability 
the company frequently faces challenges from domestic tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income 
in evaluating the exposure associated with the company s various filing positions  the company records reserves for probable exposures when identified 
based on the company s evaluation of our tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of its reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
cautionary factors this report and other documents or oral presentations prepared or delivered by and on behalf of the company contain or may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the united states private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are statements based upon management s expectations at the time such statements are made and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
when used in written documents or oral presentations  the terms anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  objective  plan  possible  potential  project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such statements  other factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statements 
also  a number of factors specific to the company or related to its business may impact the performance of cobalt common stock 
among these factors are the following the company s regulated subsidiaries are required by state regulations and the license agreement with the bca to maintain certain levels of capital 
state regulations govern the amount of capital required to be retained in cobalt s regulated subsidiaries and the ability of those regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 
those state regulations include the requirement to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus  including meeting the requirements of the rbc promulgated by the naic 
the oci has broad authority to take certain actions in the event those capital requirements are not met 
those actions could significantly impact the way the company conducts business and its ability to access capital from the operations of its regulated subsidiaries  and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the bca imposes certain financial and service performance requirements  including maintaining minimum capital requirements based on rbc 
the bca is entitled to terminate the license agreement if the company does not satisfy those requirements 
any new minimum capital requirements adopted in the future by the bca or state regulation may increase the capital requirements of the company 
changes in laws and government regulations may adversely affect the company s business 
changes in laws and government regulations designed to protect providers and members rather than shareholders could harm the company s business 
the company s business is extensively regulated by the states in which it operates and  to a lesser extent  by the federal government 
changes in existing laws and rules  the enactment of new laws and rules and changing interpretations of these laws and rules could  among other things force the company to change how it does business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase health care and administrative costs  impose additional capital requirements  and increase or change the company s managed care liability 
such regulations govern  among other things i the amount of dividends and other distributions that can be paid by certain subsidiaries without prior approval or notification  ii the granting and revoking of licenses to transact business  trade practices  premium rate regulation  underwriting standards  policy forms  claims payment  licensing of agents and brokers  minimum reserve and capital surplus requirements  and iii compelled participation in  and assessments in connection with  risk sharing pools and guaranty funds 
such regulation is primarily intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
numerous proposals relating to changes in health care law have been introduced  and some have been passed  by congress and the states in which the company operates or may operate in the future 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time 
the company is unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on its business 
although some of the recent changes in government regulations  such as the removal of the requirements on the enrollment mix between commercial and public sector membership  have encouraged managed care participation in public sector programs  the company is unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will continue to favor or hinder the growth of managed health care 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory proposals or the effect that they might have on its business 
legislation or regulations which require changes in the company s current manner of operation  provide additional benefits or change contract arrangements may seriously harm the company s operations and financial results 
government reviews  audits and investigations may adversely affect the company s business 
cobalt s subsidiaries are subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations 
any adverse investigation  audit results or sanctions could result in damage to the reputation of cobalt and its subsidiaries in various markets  increased difficulty in selling products and services  loss of a license to act as an insurer or health maintenance organization or to otherwise provide a service  loss of the right to participate in various federal programs  including the medicare supplement and medicare risk programs and medicare part a processing  and imposition of significant fines  penalties and other sanctions 
inadequate premiums would negatively affect revenues and profitability 
most of cobalt s revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these premiums are fixed by contract  and the company is obligated during the contract period to provide health care services as established by contract 
the company has less control over costs related to the provision of health care than over its selling  general and administrative expenses 
historically  our expenses related to health benefits as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated  and the percentage for any given fiscal quarter may not be indicative of full year or future results 
if premiums are not increased and expenses related to health benefits rise  cobalt s earnings would be impacted negatively 
in addition  actual health benefits costs may exceed estimated costs 
the premiums received under current contracts may therefore be inadequate to cover all claims  which may cause the company s earnings to decline 
a reduction in the number of subscribers to the company s health care programs may harm profitability 
a reduction in the number of subscribers to the company s health care programs could adversely affect its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers  premium increases and benefit changes  reduction in the company s provider network  the company s exit from markets  reductions in work force by existing customers  or negative publicity and news coverage 
cobalt s inability to manage medical costs effectively would reduce profitability 
cobalt s profitability depends  to a significant degree  on its ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
changes in health care regulations and practices  level of use of health care services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  new medical technologies  and other external factors  including general economic conditions or widespread bioterrorist acts  are beyond the company s control and would reduce its ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health care services 
although cobalt has been able to manage medical costs through a variety of techniques  including various payment methods to primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements  medical management and quality management programs  its information systems  and reinsurance arrangements  it may not be able to continue to manage costs effectively in the future 
rising health care costs may reduce profitability 
profitability may be adversely affected by rising health care costs and changes in the delivery of health care services 
much of the premium revenue the company receives is based upon rates set before services are delivered  and the related costs are usually incurred on a prospective annual basis 
although the company attempts to base the premiums charged on an estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period  competition  regulations and other circumstances may limit its ability to fully base premiums on these estimated costs 
limited ability to accurately estimate incurred medical expenses could negatively affect reported results 
the company s medical expenses include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
the company estimates its ibnr medical expenses based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience  maturity of markets  complexity of products and stability of provider networks 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change 
the company utilizes the services of independent actuaries who are contracted on a regular basis to calculate and review the adequacy of its medical liabilities  in addition to using internal resources 
the company cannot be sure that its ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to such ibnr estimates will not harm its results of operations 
further  the inability to accurately estimate ibnr may also affect the company s ability to take timely corrective actions  further exacerbating the negative impact on its results 
the company maintains reinsurance to protect it against severe or catastrophic medical claims  but there can be no assurance that such reinsurance coverage will be adequate or available in the future or that the cost of such reinsurance will not limit the company s ability to obtain it 
inability to enter into or maintain satisfactory relationships with provider networks would harm profitability 
profitability will be dependent upon the company s ability  and the ability of its subsidiaries  to contract on favorable terms with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
the failure to secure cost effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss of membership or higher medical costs 
in addition  the inability to contract with providers  or the inability of providers to provide adequate care  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s provider arrangements with primary care physicians and specialists usually are for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year terms  subject to termination for cause based on provider conduct or other appropriate reasons 
the contracts generally may be cancelled by either party upon to days prior written notice 
contracts with hospitals are usually for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year periods  subject to termination for cause due to provider misconduct or other appropriate reasons 
generally  hospital contracts may be canceled by either party without cause on to days prior written notice 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling it to service its members profitably 
the company will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
although it has established long term relationships with many of its providers  the company may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if the company is unable to retain current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  profitability will be harmed 
negative publicity may damage the company s reputation 
the health care industry is subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices which may further increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect profitability by adversely affecting the ability to market products or services  requiring the company to change its products and services  or increasing the regulatory burdens under which the company operates 
in addition  as long as the company uses the blue cross and blue shield names and service marks in marketing its managed care products  any negative publicity concerning the bca or other bca licensees may adversely affect its business 
lawsuits and other claims against the company under the health insurance portability and accountability act of may negatively impact its profitability and reputation 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to health care companies 
hipaa created civil penalties for  among other things  billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
hipaa establishes new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including a whistleblower program 
the federal government has enacted  and state governments are enacting  other fraud and abuse laws as well 
the company s failure to comply with hipaa or these other laws could result in criminal or civil penalties and exclusion from medicaid or other governmental health care programs and could lead to the revocation of cobalt s licenses 
these penalties or exclusions  were they imposed  would negatively impact the company s ability to operate its business 
the company may be subject to claims relating to managed care liability  which could cause it to incur significant expenses 
the company s providers and employees involved in care management decisions may be exposed to the risk of managed care liability claims 
in addition  states are beginning to adopt legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefit coverage determinations 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards against the company that could exceed the limits of any applicable managed care liability insurance coverage 
therefore  successful claims asserted against the company or its employees could adversely affect the company s financial condition and profitability 
in addition  cobalt may be subject to other litigation that may adversely affect its business or results of operations 
the company maintains managed care liability insurance and such other lines of coverage as it believes are reasonable in light of its experience to date 
however  this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect the company from liabilities which might adversely affect its business or results of operations 
even if any claims brought against it were unsuccessful or without merit  the company would still have to defend against such claims 
any such defenses may be time consuming and costly  and may distract management s attention 
as a result  the company may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate its business 
failure to properly maintain the integrity of proprietary information and information systems could result in the loss of customers or decrease profitability 
cobalt s business depends in part on its ability to maintain its information systems and to ensure the continued integrity of proprietary information 
the company is committed to maintaining and enhancing existing information systems and developing new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  industry standards  and customer preferences 
if it does not maintain effective and efficient information systems  then the company could experience the loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  customer and provider disputes  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses or other adverse consequences 
the bca may revoke the company s license agreements 
in connection with the license agreement with the bca  cobalt and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to ongoing and customary financial and service performance review 
because of the financial performance of cobalt  bcbsuw and compcare  the bca has included these entities in its plan performance response monitoring process  or pprmp 
as a result  the bca has requested that cobalt regularly submit additional interim financial information to the association 
in addition  the pprmp thresholds require that bcbsuw maintain a prescribed level of escrowed assets as a financial guarantee for its transactions with other blue cross plans 
the pprmp also requires that bcbsuw provide certain notices to the bca regarding transactions with other blue cross plans 
to maintain its association license  bcbsuw is required to maintain a minimum level of statutory capital and surplus based upon the rbc 
as of december   statutory and surplus for cobalt  bcbsuw and compcare exceeded the minimum licensure level 
the bca is entitled to terminate its license agreement with bcbsuw  including the right to use the blue cross and blue shield trademarks  if bcbsuw s statutory capital and surplus falls below the company action level of rbc 
in addition  the bca is entitled to terminate the license agreement if the company does not satisfy certain performance requirements or if other events described in the license agreement  some of which are beyond the company s control  were to occur including  but not limited to  violations of the ownership limitations contained in the company s amended and restated articles of incorporation or violations of divestiture deadlines by the foundation 
termination of this license agreement would significantly harm the company s ability to compete in its markets and could subject the company to monetary penalties to the bca 
cobalt is subject to competition which affects its ability to increase penetration of the markets it services 
cobalt competes on the basis of size  price  quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
the company has numerous types of competitors  including other health plans  insurers and third party administrators and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided 
some of the health plans with which the company competes have substantially larger enrollments  greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than the company does 
in addition  the company relies to a large degree on creating name brand recognition through community based programs 
where the company has only recently entered a market or competes with health plans much larger than cobalt  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage unless and until its community based programs and other promotional activities create brand awareness 
in certain markets the company competes with organizations which have a substantial market share 
in other markets competing health plans may be owned by providers 
organizations with sizable market share or provider owned plans can obtain favorable financial arrangements which are not available to the company 
without such arrangements  cobalt cannot effectively compete in such markets 
stock sales by the foundation could cause the cobalt common stock price to fall 
the foundation and cobalt entered into a voting trust and divestiture agreement in connection with the combination 
the voting trust and divestiture agreement requires the foundation to reduce its ownership of cobalt common stock by selling shares of cobalt common stock 
based upon the current number of shares of cobalt stock outstanding  the foundation must sell approximately eleven million shares of cobalt common stock within three to four years after the combination and it must sell a total of million shares of cobalt common stock within five to seven years after the combination 
given the limited historical trading volume for cobalt common stock  significant sales of cobalt common stock by the foundation  and the expectation of these sales  could cause the cobalt common stock price to fall 
the price of the cobalt stock could be affected by these factors for an undetermined period of time 
if the foundation fails to meet these divestiture requirements  cobalt will arrange for the sale of the foundation s shares pursuant to the voting trust and divestiture agreement 
registration rights of the foundation may inhibit the ability of cobalt to raise additional funds through equity offerings 
the insurance industry is in a state of change  and  in order to take advantage of acquisition and other investment opportunities that may arise in the future  cobalt may desire the flexibility to raise funds quickly by selling cobalt common stock in the equity markets 
the registration rights agreement with the foundation could limit or make more difficult cobalt s ability to raise funds through equity offerings upon desirable terms 
cobalt s failure to raise additional equity capital when required could restrict its future growth  both internally and through acquisitions  inhibit its ability to invest in technology and other products and services that it may need  adversely affect its ability to compete in the markets it serves  and restrict the availability of capital available for cobalt subsidiaries 
provisions in cobalt s amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws may prevent cobalt from being sold to a third party unless the cobalt board of directors approves the sale  and may limit or eliminate increases in stock price based on takeover speculation 
the amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws of cobalt include provisions required by the association for its for profit licensees which the association designed to protect the independence of its for profit licensees from any single shareholder 
these provisions include the following ownership limitations that prohibit institutional investors from owning or more of the cobalt voting securities  and prohibit other investors from owning or more of the cobalt voting securities  and initially  at least of the cobalt directors must be independent directors who are not affiliated or associated with the foundation or any shareholder that owns cobalt shares in excess of the ownership limits 
these provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire cobalt in a transaction that the cobalt board of directors has not negotiated or approved but in which the cobalt shareholders may receive a premium for their shares 
also  these provisions can deter a party from acquiring a significant ownership position in cobalt prior to submitting an offer to the cobalt board of directors  and  as a result  the cobalt common stock may trade at lower prices relative to other companies that do not have similar ownership limitations in their charter documents 
cobalt directors are generally able to control the outcome of all matters other than change of control proposals that are submitted to the cobalt shareholders for a vote as long as the foundation beneficially owns a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of cobalt common stock 
the foundation beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding shares of cobalt common stock 
the foundation has placed all of its shares in a voting trust for a trustee to vote and dispose of under the terms of the voting trust and divestiture agreement 
the trustee of the voting trust must  as a general matter  vote all of the foundation s shares held in the voting trust as directed by a majority of cobalt s independent directors and a majority of all of cobalt s directors on all proposals or matters that may come before the cobalt shareholders  except for matters relating to proposed combination and sale transactions if the cobalt shareholders will not own a majority of the shares of the resulting company 
thus  for so long as the foundation beneficially owns a significant number of the cobalt shares  the cobalt board of directors will be able to control the outcome of most matters brought before the cobalt shareholders for a vote  including amendments to the cobalt amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and the election and removal of the cobalt directors  subject to prior oci approval as long as the foundation beneficially owns more than of the outstanding shares of cobalt 
cobalt will not be able to sell or merge without the approval of the foundation as long as the foundation beneficially owns or more of the outstanding shares of cobalt common stock 
the acquisition of cobalt by means of a merger or consolidation will require the approval of the cobalt board of directors and the holders of a majority of the shares of the cobalt common stock 
as long as the foundation beneficially owns more than of the cobalt common stock  it will be able by itself to block any proposed sale of cobalt even if the cobalt board of directors and other shareholders would otherwise favor the transaction 
in addition  for so long as the foundation beneficially owns at least of the outstanding shares of cobalt  cobalt must consult with the foundation prior to soliciting  or upon receiving  a business combination proposal which  if consummated  would result in the then existing shareholders of cobalt owning less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the resulting company 
the foundation may have interests in cobalt that differ from the interests of other shareholders 
the foundation is a non stock  non profit corporation with the purpose of benefiting the citizens of the state of wisconsin by funding health care initiatives developed by the university of wisconsin medical school and the medical college of wisconsin 
the foundation is expected to vote its shares of the cobalt common stock on proposed merger and sale transactions based upon its best interests 
the interests of the foundation in a merger or sale transaction may be different from the interests of other shareholders 
cobalt directors will be able to ensure their re election and designate their successors as long as the foundation beneficially owns a substantial number of outstanding shares of cobalt common stock 
cobalt directors are elected by plurality vote  and the cobalt shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights 
in any election of directors  the trustee of the voting trust must vote the foundation s shares in favor of each nominee approved by a majority of the directors of cobalt who are deemed to be independent under the association s standards and a majority of all of the directors of cobalt 
however  if directors are eligible for public shareholder representation  the trustee will be directed to vote its shares in the same proportion and for the same candidates voted for by the cobalt shareholders 
also  the directors of cobalt may be removed from office only for cause as described in the amended and restated articles of incorporation and then only if the holders of or more of the outstanding shares of cobalt common stock vote for removal 
the trustee of the voting trust will vote all of the foundation s shares held in the voting trust against the removal of a director unless a majority of the independent directors of cobalt and a majority of all of the directors of cobalt initiate or consent to the removal 
as a result  the directors of cobalt will likely be able to ensure their re election and designate their successors for as long as the foundation owns a substantial number of shares of cobalt common stock 
there are additional miscellaneous risks that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business 
additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s future results of operations  financial condition or business include  but are not limited to demand for  and market acceptance of  its products and services  ability to develop and deliver new products and services and adapt existing products and services to meet customer needs and expectations  ability to keep pace with technological change in order to provide better service and remain competitive  ability to attract and retain capital for growth and operations on competitive terms  government intervention in the health care industry  and changes in accounting policies and practices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because of cobalt s investment policies  the primary market risks associated with cobalt s portfolio are interest rate risk  credit risk and the risk related to fluctuations in equity prices 
with respect to interest rate risk  a reasonably near term rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of cobalt s bond portfolio 
however  because cobalt considers it unlikely that cobalt would need or choose to substantially liquidate its portfolio  cobalt believes that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows 
in addition  cobalt is exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception may affect the value of financial instruments 
the overall goal of the investment portfolio is to support the ongoing operations of cobalt 
cobalt s philosophy is to manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
cobalt manages these risks by establishing gain and loss tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among asset classes and segments within various asset classes  and using performance measurement and reporting 
cobalt uses a sensitivity model to assess the interest rate risk of its fixed income investments 
the model includes all fixed income securities held as of december  and incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on expected cash flows for certain financial assets with prepayment features  such as callable bonds and mortgage backed securities 
the reduction in the fair value of cobalt s modeled financial assets aggregate of bcbsuw and uws portfolios resulting from a hypothetical instantaneous basis point increase in the us treasury yield curve is estimated at million as of december
