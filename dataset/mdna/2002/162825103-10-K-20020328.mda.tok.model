item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  and bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the accompanying financial statements  with the exception of the change in accounting method for revenue recognition  as noted below 
the company believes the following accounting policy is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on the sale of equipment where post shipment obligations exist 
previously  the company recognized revenue for equipment when title transferred  generally upon shipment 
beginning with the first quarter of year  the company began recognizing revenue when installation is complete or other post shipment obligations have been satisfied 
equipment leased to customers under sales type leases is accounted for as the equivalent of a sale 
the present value of such lease revenues is recorded as net revenues  and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of revenues 
the deferred finance charges applicable to these leases are recognized over the terms of the leases using the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method 
rental revenue from equipment under operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease 
service revenue is recognized  for service contracts  on a straight line basis over the contractual period  and  for non contract work  as services are performed 
sales to third party leasing companies are recognized as the equivalent of a sale 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the adequacy of the reserves for doubtful accounts is continually assessed 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if economic or political conditions were to change in the countries where the company does business  it could have a significant impact on the results of operations  and the company s ability to realize the full value of its accounts receivable 
furthermore  the company is dependent on customers in the retail markets 
economic difficulties experienced in those markets could have a significant impact on the results of operations  and the company s ability to realize the full value of its accounts receivables 
inventory reserves 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and identified intangible assets 
long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the fair value of the long lived assets are based upon the company s estimates of future cash flows and other factors 
following the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on december  fiscal year  which requires annual testing for the impairment of goodwill  the fair value of goodwill will be based upon the company s estimates of future cash flows and other factors including discount rates 
if these assets or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
an erosion of future business results in any of the business units could create impairment in goodwill or other long lived assets and require a significant write down in future periods 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company considers future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
accounting for loss contingencies 
the company is involved in certain legal and regulatory actions which  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for contingencies  it continually evaluates  and upon which  it makes various judgements and estimates 
see note if the final outcome of these matters differs from the company s judgements and estimates  such differences could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations all comparisons are with the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
management s discussion and analysis of results of operations has been presented on an as reported basis except for the exclusion in cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expense sg a  of the restructuring and integration charges recorded in   and the annual savings as a result of restructuring charges are included in the discussion of the results of operations

the increase in of the recurring revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is principally due to the acquisition of the meto business 
the company s customers are substantially dependent on retail sales  which are seasonal and subject to significant fluctuations and are difficult to predict

as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues increased from to 
the increase in the company s cost of revenues as a percentage of sales is attributable to an increase in negative overhead absorption variances of approximately million following the company s effort to decrease inventory levels by reducing manufacturing production schedules 
this was partially offset by increased sales of high margin hls products and a reduction in field service and installation costs 
in  the cost of revenues increase was a direct result of the additional revenue related to the inclusion of the meto business for a full year

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in the financial statements 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on the sale of equipment where post shipment obligations exist 
previously  the company recognized revenue for equipment when title transferred  generally upon shipment 
beginning with the first quarter of  the company began recognizing revenue when installation was complete or other post shipment obligations have been satisfied 
during the first quarter of  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a non cash reduction in net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
net earnings loss net earnings loss was million or 
per share  million or 
per share  and million or 
per share for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the weighted average number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share computation were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in the weighted average number of shares from to was primarily due to the exercise of employee stock options 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs have related to  and are expected to continue to relate to  capital investments  acquisitions  and working capital requirements 
the company has met its liquidity needs over the last three years primarily through funds provided by long term borrowings and more recently through cash generated from operations 
the company believes that cash provided from operating activities and funding available under its current credit agreements should be adequate to service debt and meet its capital investment requirements 
the company s operating activities during fiscal generated approximately million compared to approximately million during this change from the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in working capital  especially in inventories and accounts receivable 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of meto ag 
in connection with the acquisition  the company entered into a new million six and one half year senior collateralized multi currency credit facility with a consortium of twenty one banks led by the company s principal lending bank 
the credit facility  which expires on march   included a million equivalent multi currency term note and a million equivalent multi currency revolving line of credit 
interest on the facility resets monthly and is based on the eurocurrency base rate plus an applicable margin 
at december   million euro approximately million and million were outstanding under the term loan 
the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were billion japanese yen approximately million 
on march   the million revolving line of credit was reduced to million 
the company has never paid a cash dividend except for a nominal cash distribution in april  to redeem the rights outstanding under the company s shareholders rights plan 
the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividend in the near future and is limited by existing covenants in the company s debt instruments with regard to paying dividends 
the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the company at december  are summarized below total due in amounts less than due in due in due after due year years years years thousands contractual obligations long term debt     lines of credit   capital lease obligations      operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations      management believes that its anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future can be funded from cash and cash equivalents on hand  the availability under the million revolving credit facility  and cash generated from future operations 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures during fiscal totaled million compared to million during fiscal the reduction in expenditures occurred in manufacturing equipment  it hardware  and office equipment 
the company anticipates its capital expenditures to approximate million in stock repurchase there have been no stock repurchases since furthermore  certain restrictions exist under the terms of the senior secured facility  which prohibit the repurchase of the company s stock 
exposure to international operations the company manufactures products in the usa  the caribbean  europe  and the asia pacific region for both the local marketplace as well as for export to its foreign subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries  in turn  sell these products to customers in their respective geographic area of operation  generally in local currencies 
this method of sale and resale gives rise to the risk of gains or losses as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to reduce the company s exposure resulting from currency fluctuations  the company has been selectively purchasing currency exchange forward contracts on a regular basis 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows the company to shift the risk  whether positive or negative  of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party 
as of december   the company had currency exchange forward contracts totaling approximately million 
the contracts are in the various local currencies covering primarily the company s western european operations along with the company s canadian and australian operations 
historically  the company has not purchased currency exchange forward contracts for its operations in south america and asia 
the company will continue to evaluate the use of currency options in order to reduce the impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on the company s net earnings from sales made by the company s international operations 
the combination of forward exchange contracts and currency options should reduce the company s risks associated with significant exchange rate fluctuations 
other matters new accounting pronouncements and other standards the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached consensus in on issue  accounting for certain sales incentives 
the standard addresses the income statement classification of certain selling costs 
the standard became effective for the company on december  fiscal year 
the company does not expect the standard to result in a material restatement of prior periods 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
for the company  these statements became effective december   although business combinations initiated after july  are subject to the non amortization and purchase accounting provisions 
the impact on the company s pre tax earnings for from the non amortization of goodwill will be approximately million 
in accordance with sfas  the company is currently evaluating goodwill for possible impairment 
the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations on august  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on october  for the company  sfas becomes effective on december  and sfas became effective on december  the effects of these pronouncements on the company s financial statements are currently being assessed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options denominated in foreign currency to hedge certain foreign currency exposure and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow 
see accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions in the summary of significant accounting policies  note  and financial instruments and risk management  note sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices  which are reasonably possible over a one year period  are described below 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices 
the company s financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of fixed rate debt instruments 
these debt instruments have a net fair value of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in interest rates at december  would result in a million decrease in the net market value of the liability 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  would result in a million increase in the net market value of the liability 
the company s million subordinated debentures are also subject to equity price risk 
the fair value of these debentures was a liability of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the year end closing price of the company s common stock  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening in the company s common stock would result in a net increase in the fair value liability of million  while a weakening in the company s common stock would result in a net decrease in the fair value liability of million 
the company s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk include the million euro term loan  the million multi currency revolving credit facility  and the million deutsche mark and million deutsche mark capital leases 
at december   million euro approximately million was outstanding under the term loan 
the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was billion japanese yen approximately million 
the outstanding amounts under the capital leases were million deutsche mark approximately million and million deutsche mark approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro would result in a million decrease in the liability of the term loan  revolving credit facility and capital leases  while a weakening of the us dollar versus the euro would result in a million increase in the liability of the term loan  revolving credit facility  and capital leases 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million decrease in the liability of the revolving credit facility  while a weakening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million increase in the liability of the revolving credit facility 
also subject to foreign currency exchange risk are the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options which represent a net asset position of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus other currencies would result in an increase of million in the net asset position  while a weakening of the dollar versus all other currencies would result in a decrease of million 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts are used to hedge certain of the company s firm foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 
presently  the only significant restrictions on the remittance of funds generated by the company s operations outside the usa are in argentina
