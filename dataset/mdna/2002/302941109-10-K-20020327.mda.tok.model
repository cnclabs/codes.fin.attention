item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fti consulting  inc the company or fti is a multi disciplined consulting firm with leading practices in the areas of financial restructuring  litigation support and engineering and scientific investigation 
we are organized into three distinct operating segments that contribute to the overall performance of our company 
our financial consulting division  which accounted for of our revenues and was our most profitable division  offers a broad range of financial consulting services  such as forensic accounting  bankruptcy and restructuring analysis  expert testimony  damage assessment  cost benefit analysis and business valuations 
our applied sciences division  which accounted for of our revenues  offers forensic engineering and scientific investigation services  accident reconstruction  fire investigation and expert testimony regarding intellectual property rights 
our litigation consulting division  which accounted for of our revenues  provides advice and services in connection with all phases of the litigation process 
we evaluate segment performance based on our operating income before depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expenses and income taxes for each division 
in  our financial consulting division accounted for of our operating income  while our applied sciences division accounted for and our litigation consulting division accounted for 
our direct cost of revenues consists primarily of employee compensation and related payroll benefits  the cost of outside consultants assigned to revenue generating activities and other related expenses billable to clients 
in our direct costs were of revenues  consistent with our overall long term target and an improvement from in selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits paid to office and corporate staff  as well as rent  marketing  corporate overhead expenses and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  accounted for about of our revenues  approximately the same as the result in and consistent with our long term target of excluding depreciation and amortization 
our corporate overhead costs which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses  represented about of revenues in and in critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive most of our revenue from providing professional services to our clients 
most of these services are rendered under arrangements that require the client to pay us a fee for the hours that we incur at agreed upon rates 
we also bill our clients for the cost of the production of our work products and other direct expenses that we incur on behalf of the client  such as travel costs and materials that we purchase to produce presentations for courtroom proceedings 
we recognize our revenue from professional services as our work is performed and expenses are incurred 
because we normally obtain engagement letters and other agreements from our clients prior to performing our services  the revenue that we recognize in any period is generally not subject to the risk that future discounts or allowances will significantly reduce the revenue that we recognized 
bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay our fees or for disputes that affect our ability to fully collect our billed accounts receivable 
we estimate this allowance by reviewing the status of past due accounts and recording general reserves based on historical bad debt expense 
our actual experience has not varied significantly from our estimates 
however  if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay our fees  we may need to record additional allowances in future periods 
mitigating this risk is that we often require retainers from our clients prior to performing significant services 
at december   these retainers totaled million  and are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable 
goodwill we have remaining goodwill of million at december  that was recorded in connection with business combinations that we completed principally in the last five years 
this goodwill represents about of our total assets at december  we amortize this goodwill over useful lives that range from to years 
beginning in january  when we adopt a new accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standards board  we will no longer amortize this goodwill  but rather will make annual assessments of impairment 
in making these impairment assessments  we must make subjective judgments regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the segments of our business that are associated with this goodwill 
it is possible that these judgments may change over time as market conditions or our strategies change  and these changes may cause us to record impairment charges to adjust our goodwill to its estimated fair value 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in connection with our various acquisitions  we recorded goodwill 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
on december   we had about million of unamortized goodwill  which we had been amortizing over to year periods 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statement no 
eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill over finite lives 
rather  the asset must be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting level using an approach defined by the statement 
we will adopt statement no 
in january and accordingly amortization of goodwill will no longer be recorded 
goodwill amortization was approximately million in the statement also provides that any impairment loss recognized as a result of a transitional impairment test of goodwill is recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the period of adoption 
we believe that a transitional impairment charge will not be required 
we discuss goodwill amortization further in amortization of goodwill below 
acquisition on february   we acquired policano manzo  llc p m as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
p m  based in saddle brook  new jersey  specializes in providing financial restructuring  advisory and forensic accounting services to the workout and bankruptcy community 
these services are provided on a nationwide basis to financially distressed businesses  creditors  investors and other interested parties 
the purchase price totaled million  consisting of million in cash   shares of our common stock valued at million and acquisition related expenses of million 
we did not make any acquisitions in results of operations years ended december    and revenues 
total revenues in increased to million from million in our financial consulting division revenues grew by to million in from million in  primarily as a result our ability to recruit seasoned financial professionals to meet the continued strong demand for our financial consulting services in both restructuring and turnaround activities and the forensic accounting and strategic consulting portions of the business  coupled with increases in professional rates 
we believe that the market demand for our services in these areas will continue to be strong throughout  and we have added several new practice areas to the division in early  including crisis management  intellectual property litigation consulting  electronic evidence discovery and utility regulatory and financial consulting 
our applied sciences division experienced revenue growth in to million from million in this division grew faster than its historical rate of to due primarily to a significant number of unanticipated assignments 
these engagements include restoration assignments near the site of the former world trade center that are expected to be completed early in the first quarter of we see no changes in the long term trends for this division and anticipate that its growth for will be within its historical range 
our litigation consulting division revenues decreased to million in from million in  continuing the decline that began in the third quarter of primarily as a result of an unusual number of trials that were deferred or cancelled due to settlement or settlement discussions 
because we do not foresee this trend reversing during  we continue to monitor this business segment closely and have taken significant steps to contain costs  including reorganizing responsibilities along national lines for our two principal practice areas  trial consulting and trial technologies 
our goals are to improve our overall utilization of employees  further standardize practices  install new incentive systems for our sales and marketing efforts  establish new profit incentive programs  continue to reduce costs by flattening our organizational structure and work on enhancing opportunities through our new electronic evidence and intellectual property consulting businesses 
total revenues in increased over our litigation consulting revenues increased from to as a result of an increased volume of cases 
our applied sciences division experienced growth in compared to  the high end of its historical growth trend 
our financial consulting division s revenues grew by in compared to on a pro forma basis  including the acquisition in february of p m described above  the division grew  due in part to the faster than anticipated integration of the acquisition and the strong market demand for our financial consulting services 
direct cost of revenues 
direct cost of revenues was of our total revenues in  in and in the improvement in resulted primarily from the relative growth of the financial consulting division which has a higher operating margin than our other divisions  and is in line with our long term target of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of our total revenues  these expenses  which include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  were in  in and in the decrease in and compared to was primarily attributed to the growth of our financial consulting division that has a lower ratio of selling  general and administrative expenses to revenues than our litigation consulting and applied sciences divisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  was of revenues in  and is consistent with our long term target of 
amortization of goodwill 
annual amortization of goodwill increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of additional contingent consideration related to our acquisitions 
amortization of goodwill increased from million in primarily as a result of the p m acquisition in february described above 
other income and expenses 
interest expense consisted primarily of interest on debt we incurred to purchase businesses over the past several years 
interest expense decreased substantially in because we were able to retire our debt with cash flow from operations and because interest rates were lower 
we used the proceeds of an equity offering in october to repay million of debt  refinanced our remaining debt in late to achieve lower interest rates  used cash generated from operations and proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants to pay down debt  and experienced declining market interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in and in  principally as a reduced effect of some of the goodwill amortization during those periods not being deductible for income tax purposes 
we expect that our effective tax rate will decline to about in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax rates during each of these years  and a summary of the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
extraordinary item  net of taxes 
as a result of the write off of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with the debt that we refinanced or early retirement in  we had a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes in liquidity and capital resources our cash flow generated from operations increased from million in to million in this increase of million is primarily the result of an increase in our net income before non cash charges of million 
we also were able to increase our operating cash flows by reducing our working capital balances  despite significant growth in our revenues 
the average collection period for our fees has declined because we continue to increase the use of retainers when we are engaged on major assignments and because we have improved our collection monitoring processes 
during the year ended december   we spent million for net additions to property and equipment  primarily for the cost of the expansion of five of our major offices 
at december   we had no material commitments for the acquisition of property and equipment 
we also paid million to former owners of businesses we acquired in previous years to satisfy contingent consideration and other obligations 
during  we spent million for additions to property and equipment and million to acquire p m 
during the year ended december   options to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised  generating million in new capital including related tax benefits 
in addition  we sold  shares of common stock to our employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan  generating million of cash 
we used these net proceeds and cash flow from operations to pay down million of debt during the year 
in  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
we used the net proceeds and our other financial resources to repay the million senior subordinated notes that we issued on february  in addition  we retired warrants for  shares of our common stock issued in february in connection with the million senior subordinated notes that were repaid 
in december  we refinanced our million term loan and the million revolving credit facility 
our new credit facility consists of an amortizing term loan of million of which million was outstanding at december   and a million revolving credit line 
at december   we have no outstanding balances on the line of credit the credit facility bears interest at libor plus  which would decline based on our leverage ratio 
the interest rate declined to libor plus at the beginning of august and declined to at the beginning of november we obtained interest rate protection  through interest rate swaps  on the million term loan 
the credit facility is secured by all of our assets 
under the credit facility  we are required to comply with various specified financial covenants related to our operating performance at the end of each quarter  and the payment of dividends is restricted 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants throughout and expect to be in compliance with all loan covenants until the term loan is fully repaid by the end of december required principal payments under the term loan are substantially less in each year than our cash flow from operations for we also believe that our available cash and the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our normal on going operating requirements until the facility expires and do not envision circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect these sources of liquidity 
we do not have any significant capital lease obligations 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments including the aforementioned credit facility are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt      operating leases       total obligations       forward looking statements some of the statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements not to be fully achieved

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
we have managed this risk by entering into interest rate swaps 
these hedges reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  but also reduce the benefits from lower interest rates 
we do not anticipate any material changes to our market risk exposures in interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of million at december  were designated as hedges against outstanding debt and were used to convert the interest rate on our variable rate debt to fixed rates for the life of the swap 
our pay rate on our debt was at december   compared to our receive rate of 
because of the effectiveness of our hedge of variable interest rates associated with our debt  the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps resulting from changes in market interest rates is reported as a component of other comprehensive income
