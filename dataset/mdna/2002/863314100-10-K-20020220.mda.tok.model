net sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses operating income income before income taxes net income percent to net sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses nonrecurring charges income operating income income before income taxes net income we operate in a difficult business environment and through the normal course of business are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the footwear industry is subject to rapid and substantial shifts in consumer tastes and preferences 
the principal markets for our product  the united states and canada  are mature 
in order to increase our business  we must increase our market share relative to our competitors  and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in doing so 
we predominantly sell our products to large retailers 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to trade receivables 
however  there is a risk that some of these retail customers could experience financial difficulties  particularly in a weak economy  that may cause them to extend payment times or to default on their obligations to us 
if a large customer were to default on its financial obligations to us  we could experience a decrease in liquidity 
we believe  however  that we have sufficient financial resources to mitigate the affect that a large default would have on our ability to continue to operate our business 
in addition to the impact on liquidity  we could also experience a decrease in future revenue and operating margins related to this loss of business 
the fashion oriented nature of our business  along with the potential for changes in customer preferences and the extended product development lead times leave us vulnerable to the risk of inventory obsolescence 
we are also exposed to the risk of inventory markdowns for excess or obsolete product  both at stride rite owned retail stores and from independent retailers 
we monitor retail sell through data and make provisions for markdowns as they become known 
our provisions have been adequate in the past and have not fluctuated significantly 
we regularly review our provisions for obsolescence for inventory on hand or committed 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenue and operating margins would suffer if we are unable to effectively do so 
during fiscal  we plan to open approximately additional stride rite owned retail stores 
historically  it has taken twelve to fifteen months for new stores to achieve their normal financial operating performance 
prior to that time  we are likely to incur a use of cash related to both the capital investment required and the disproportionate build up of operating costs compared to revenue 
the licensing arrangement with tommy hilfiger licensing  inc to produce and sell hilfiger branded footwear is a significant portion of our business 
during fiscal  we renewed the agreement for an additional three year term which expires in march whether our license with tommy hilfiger will remain in effect depends on the economics of that business including our achieving certain minimum sales levels for the licensed product 
if we lose the tommy hilfiger license  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant estimates included in these financial statements include valuation allowances and reserves for accounts receivable  inventory and income taxes 
these areas are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above 
actual results  therefore  could differ from those estimates 
net sales during fiscal  consolidated net sales decreased million to million  or below the sales level achieved in fiscal a significant portion of this shortfall from fiscal occurred in the second half of the year  as the economy weakened 
many retail customers  concerned over the health of the economy  responded by tightly managing their inventory levels resulting in an adverse effect on reorders 
this change in our wholesale customers buying plans is expected to continue into fiscal if this trend continues and the economy remains weak  it may negatively affect net sales in fiscal sales of stride rite s branded wholesale operations decreased in fiscal unit shipments of current line merchandise during fiscal for stride rite s wholesale brands were below the prior year  while average selling prices declined from fiscal sales of discontinued products were higher than last year 
sales of the stride rite children s group were higher than fiscal  with a sales increase at stride rite children s retail stores somewhat offset by a decrease in sales to independent dealers  family shoe stores and department stores 
sales at comparable stores open for weeks in each fiscal year stride rite stores increased during fiscal  following a comparable store sales increase in fiscal stride rite children s group opened retail stores in fiscal and closed underperforming stores during the year to leave the year end store count at stores  up from the stores that were open as of december  in fiscal  stride rite concept stores and manufacturers outlets represented approximately of the stride rite children s group sales with the remaining revenues related to sales of stride rite brand products to independent specialty and department stores 
the stride rite children s group retail concept stores are expected to take on increased importance in future years 
current plans call for the opening of approximately new stride rite stores during fiscal these new stores are expected to offset much of the sales decline that will occur after the exit of the leased department store business scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  stride rite children s group began a sub branding strategy to leverage its expertise in children s footwear 
munchkin s products were introduced into the mid tier channel and added approximately million to sales for the fiscal year 
kids smart and baby smart products will be introduced into target stores during the spring season 
we will receive both a design and a sourcing fee on these products 
the overall decrease in our sales in fiscal was driven principally by the keds footwear brand  which recorded an sales decline for the year 
sales of the reinvented women s champion r  although ahead of last year  were not sufficient to offset the declines in the other women s and children s products  down and  respectively 
the decline in other women s products was due to a decline in the keds stretch tm product line and the lower overall sales performance of the keds fall seasonal products 
the keds children s line of business was down due to lower retailer acceptance of fall seasonal items 
net sales for the grasshoppers tm product line  fueled by new distribution and higher sales in existing stores  continued to grow  up from fiscal we opened five keds retail stores in fiscal to evaluate the direct to consumer distribution alternative for existing and new keds products 
four of these keds stores are located in the southeastern part of the united states and one store is located in the midwest 
these keds retail stores are designed to provide a controlled presentation and selection of keds products to the consumer 
these stores are not expected to add significant sales volume to keds during fiscal the general weakness in the department store sector had a significantly negative impact on the sales of both tommy hilfiger and sperry products  due to their reliance on this channel for a significant portion of their sales 
sales of tommy hilfiger footwear products decreased as compared to the same period in fiscal sales of the tommy hilfiger women s and men s products declined and  respectively  from fiscal sales of tommy hilfiger children s products decreased from the prior year  primarily the result of a large customer narrowing the brand s product selection in their stores 
closeout sales for the tommy hilfiger footwear brand increased above the amounts recorded in fiscal due to more aggressive product markdowns and tighter inventory controls 
sales of the sperry top sider brand decreased from fiscal sales of men s and women s boat shoes increased from fiscal and were the only categories that recorded increased sales 
overall  sales of sperry top sider men s products decreased from the prior year while sales of the women s products were lower by 
international division revenues in fiscal were higher than fiscal  due to a launch of the keds brand in mexico  a increase in tommy hilfiger sales in south america and increased royalty income from israel  all of which were somewhat offset by weak canadian sales compared to the prior year 
in fiscal  consolidated net sales decreased million to million or from the sales level achieved in fiscal with sales of stride rite s wholesale brands down and sales of company owned stores above fiscal by 
unit shipments of current line merchandise were lower than the prior year  while the average selling price declined from fiscal sales of discontinued products in fiscal were above fiscal sales of the stride rite children s group increased during fiscal with all of the growth produced by our retail stores 
we opened retail stores in fiscal and closed underperforming stores  ending the year with a store count at stores  up from fiscal year end 
sales at comparable stride rite owned retail stores increased during fiscal sales of the keds brand decreased in fiscal with children s sales down and women s sales below the prior year by 
during fiscal  the keds brand exited several basic women s product lines  the largest being keds ready to wear tm  resulting in a million sales decrease 
sales of keds champion r oxford also declined by 
these sales decreases were partially offset by increased sales of keds stretch tm products and higher sales of discontinued styles 
tommy hilfiger brand sales were down from fiscal due to a reduction in the average selling price and increased sales allowances 
unit shipments of tommy hilfiger products in fiscal were slightly higher than in fiscal in fiscal  sales of sperry declined  while international division sales declined due to lower royalties from sales in japan and the conversion of certain distributors in south america to license arrangements 
gross profit in fiscal  our gross profit of million decreased million or below fiscal our gross profit rate declined percentage points to comparable to the rate achieved in fiscal included in the fiscal cost of sales was a million charge associated with the write down of inventory caused by the exit of the leased department store business by the retail division of the stride rite children s group 
excluding this charge  the gross profit rate for fiscal would have been  percentage points higher than fiscal first quality gross profit declined percentage points from the level achieved in fiscal  principally the result of an unfavorable product mix within the keds product lines 
obsolescence costs also contributed to a decline in gross profit of percentage points as compared to fiscal this decline was offset by an increase in the gross profit percent on closeout sales and the impact of the sales increase at stride rite owned retail stores  which produce a higher gross profit percentage than stride rite s wholesale brands 
our retail operations represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal as compared to of total sales in fiscal our last in  first out lifo provision had little impact on gross profit comparisons with lifo decreasing gross profit by million less than of net sales in fiscal  compared to a decrease of million of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  our gross profit of million decreased million or below fiscal our gross profit rate declined percentage points to compared to the rate achieved in fiscal in fiscal  our gross profit was unfavorably impacted by the lifo provision  reducing profitability by percentage points 
in fiscal  lifo reduced gross profit by million of net sales  while product cost reductions in fiscal helped to produce a lifo benefit of million of net sales 
increased obsolescence charges  retail markdowns and higher sales allowances also had a negative effect on gross profit performance in fiscal with these costs reducing the gross profit percent by an additional percentage points 
fiscal gross profit performance was favorably impacted by sales increases from stride rite owned retail stores  which generally produce a higher gross profit percentage than stride rite s wholesale brands 
operating costs selling and administrative expenses excluding nonrecurring charges in fiscal increased million to million or above the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling and administrative costs were in compared to in fiscal included in expenses for fiscal were executive termination costs of million 
excluding these executive termination costs  selling and administrative costs would have been lower by million  or below fiscal retail store expenses in fiscal increased million from fiscal as we accelerated our pace of store openings during the year 
offsetting these higher costs were lower marketing and advertising spending  down million or from fiscal most of this decrease occurred in the keds and tommy hilfiger brands 
marketing and advertising represent of net sales in fiscal  down from the fiscal spending rate of of sales 
spending on information systems decreased from the fiscal total as we started to benefit from system integration activities completed in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring which eliminated positions from our administrative staff  exited the leased department store business and recorded retail system asset impairment costs 
the restructuring actions are expected to reduce operating costs by approximately million annually beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the consolidated statement of income includes pre tax  nonrecurring charges of million to cover costs associated with these restructuring efforts 
the restructuring amount includes million of severance payments  million of other employee benefit related costs  million for the write down of leaseholds and retail system asset impairment costs and million of other costs 
selling and administrative expenses excluding nonrecurring items in fiscal decreased million to million or below fiscal the restructuring actions completed in fiscal  resulting in the elimination of approximately positions  were a major factor contributing to this decrease 
marketing and advertising costs were million or below fiscal  due to lower contractual payments in the tommy hilfiger footwear business and lower expenses related to the keds brand 
retail store expenses in fiscal increased million from fiscal as we accelerated our pace of opening new stores 
spending on information systems increased as we began to amortize the cost of a new order management system 
we recorded a credit to income of million related to the reversal of unused accruals from the nonrecurring charge 
other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal investment income decreased by million in fiscal  the result of lower average investments and a lower average rate of return 
investment income decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal interest expense in fiscal decreased from fiscal  million as a higher average borrowing level was offset by a lower average interest rate 
interest expense in fiscal increased million from fiscal as higher interest rates during the year offset a reduction in average borrowings 
the average interest rate was in fiscal year  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  other income and expense items decreased pre tax income by million  compared to a decrease of million in fiscal and a decrease of million in fiscal in fiscal  the provision for income taxes decreased million due to a reduction in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate 
the lower tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to a reduction in the need for certain tax accruals recorded in prior periods which were no longer required 
our effective income tax rate was in  in and in net income we earned million in fiscal  million or below fiscal s net income amount 
excluding the nonrecurring charges in fiscal related to the restructuring of our administrative staff  the exit of the leased department store business and retail system asset impairment costs  net income would have decreased  million or in fiscal  to million as compared to million in fiscal the reduced earnings in fiscal resulted from the lower level of net sales and the reduced gross profit percent during the year somewhat offset by the lower income tax rate 
we earned million in fiscal  below fiscal s net income by million or 
excluding the nonrecurring items related to the restructuring of our administrative staff in fiscal  net income decreased from the prior year or million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the reduced earnings in fiscal resulted from the lower level of net sales and the reduced gross profit percent during the year 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  our balance sheet reflected a current ratio of with no long term debt 
our cash and short term investments totaled million at november   up million from the total cash and short term investments of million at the end of fiscal much of this increase was the result of the reallocation of the intermediate term fixed income investments to short term investments  the result of a change in both investment policy and managers 
we place our short term investments with highly rated financial institutions and in investment grade instruments with maturities of less than three months  which limits our credit exposure 
in addition  other assets included million in fiscal and million in fiscal of investments in intermediate term  fixed income instruments 
during fiscal  our operations generated million  following operating cash flows of million in fiscal and million in fiscal our inventory levels increased as compared to the prior year in part because of lower sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  caused by the general slowdown in the economy 
year end inventories totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or from the fiscal year end level  with the largest increase occurring in the keds brand  up from fiscal much of the inventory increase occurred in in line merchandise and is expected to be sold through during fiscal the inventory increase in fiscal followed a decrease of million in fiscal during fiscal  our inventory turnover averaged times compared to turnover rates of in fiscal and in fiscal as of november   accounts receivable totaled million  below the fiscal year end level by million or 
this decrease followed an accounts receivable increase of million during fiscal the lower year end level of accounts receivable in fiscal was impacted by the fourth quarter s lower sales  which were largely the result of lower reorder rates in the department store sector amid the general economic slowdown 
at november   our average day s sales outstanding dso totaled days  favorable compared to the fiscal year end statistic of days  but less favorable than the dso of days in fiscal additions to property and equipment totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal included million related to computer systems as we continued our efforts to upgrade information systems capabilities 
as those new systems have become operational  the rate of spending on information technology has declined 
during fiscal  million was expended on computer systems 
during fiscal  we expended million to expand our huntington  indiana distribution facility 
the additional capacity allowed us to transfer the distribution for our sperry brand to the indiana facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal and to terminate a higher cost outsourcing arrangement 
in fiscal  capital spending related to retail stores totaled million compared to retail expenditures of million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  we opened new retail stores compared to store openings in fiscal we also closed underperforming retail locations in fiscal going forward  we will continue to focus our efforts on improving retail profitability by critically evaluating underperforming locations  analyzing the effectiveness of the test of the keds retail store concept and opening new stride rite concept stores and manufacturers outlets  where appropriate 
in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we expect to open approximately new stores in fiscal these new stores are expected to offset the closing of leased department stores as we will be exiting that business during the second quarter of fiscal funding for capital expenditures will generally be provided from internal sources 
if business conditions do not allow for the funding of capital purchases internally  these plans will be re evaluated 
we returned million to shareholders during fiscal through share repurchases and cash dividends 
we expended million in fiscal to repurchase  common shares under our share repurchase program 
over the three year period ended november   we repurchased a total of million common shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of november   we have million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization that the board of directors approved in december we believe that share repurchases are an effective means of providing value to shareholders and will continue to make opportunistic share repurchases 
we have paid a dividend to shareholders each quarter since we became a public company in cash used for dividends decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result of the reduction in outstanding shares 
funds for these stock repurchases and dividends were provided from internal sources 
under the terms of our revolving credit agreement  we are not allowed to make annual distributions to shareholders in excess of million 
during the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments 
additionally  economic conditions in countries where we source our products could negatively affect future inventory purchase commitments 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from outside the united states 
because these purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we do not engage in forward foreign exchange and other similar contracts because the associated risk is not considered significant 
we utilize cash from operations  short term investments and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
in addition to internal sources of capital  we maintain a bank line of credit to satisfy the seasonal borrowing requirements that are imposed by the sales patterns which are characteristic of stride rite and of the footwear industry 
because of these seasonal demands  there are times during the year when we are less liquid 
during fiscal  we entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with five banks providing for loans of up to million 
we will begin discussion with the bank group during fiscal for the renewal of this credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement requires us to meet certain financial ratios and covenants and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  we may borrow at interest rates which vary with libor 
in addition  the agreement calls for facility fees of per annum on the committed line 
at year end  our borrowings under this credit line totaled million  leaving million available for additional borrowings 
during fiscal  our borrowings averaged million compared to the average borrowings of million in fiscal and million in fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as amended  summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
the company adopted sab in the first quarter of fiscal year adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
interpretation clarifies guidance for certain issues that arose in the application of apb areas of focus within interpretation include repricings  modifications to extend the option term  change of grantee status  modifications to accelerate vesting and options exchanged in a purchase business combination 
should these types of transactions occur  the company will account for them under apb as clarified by interpretation in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
in addition  companies are required to review goodwill and intangible assets reported in connection with prior acquisitions  possibly disaggregate and report separately previously identified intangible assets and possibly reclassify certain intangible assets into goodwill 
sfas no 
establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of this statement provide a single accounting model for impairment of long lived assets 
we are currently assessing the effect of this new standard but do not expect it to affect financial reporting materially 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
cash balances are normally invested in high grade securities with terms shorter than three months 
because of the short term nature of these investments  changes in interest rates would not impact the fair value of these financial instruments 
we have available an unsecured committed revolving line of credit as a source of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under this revolving credit agreement bears interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable spread 
at november   we had million outstanding under this credit facility 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in canada 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar  are generally considered long term 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments
