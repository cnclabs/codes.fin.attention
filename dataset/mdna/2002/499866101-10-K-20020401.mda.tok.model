koala overview we are a leading designer  producer and worldwide marketer of innovative commercial products  systems and custom solutions that create attractive family friendly environments for businesses and other public venues 
our sales are derived from two business segments  family convenience and children s activity products and children s modular play equipment 
our family convenience and activity products include baby changing stations and high chairs  activity tables  carpets and foam play products 
children s modular play equipment includes indoor and outdoor playground equipment and interactive play equipment used in water parks  family entertainment centers and amusement parks 
we intend to capitalize on brand name recognition established through our market leading koala bear kare baby changing station 
our sales have grown from million in to million in  with sales growth generated by both the acquisition of seven businesses and the internal growth achieved by these businesses during this period 
prior to  our sales were derived primarily from the sale of family convenience products  which include baby changing stations  disposable sanitary liners for the baby changing stations  child protection seats  infant seat kradles and booster buddy seats 
one of our strategies has been to reduce our dependence on baby changing stations through the acquisition and development of complementary products 
in furtherance of this strategy  we acquired the following businesses o activities unlimited  a manufacturer of commercial use children s activities products in march  o delta play  a provider of custom children s indoor modular play equipment in june  o park structures  a producer of children s outdoor modular play equipment in december  o superior foam  a manufacturer of children s foam activity products in march  o smart products  a provider of children s safety and parental convenience products in september  o scs  a manufacturer of children s interactive water play equipment in march  and o fibar  a marketer and distributor of playground surfacing systems in august as a result of these acquisitions and introduction of new products  baby changing stations represented less than of our sales in we market our products  systems and custom solutions to a wide range of businesses and public facilities that serve customers and visitors who bring children to their establishments 
we market our products through an integrated program of direct sales and distribution through a network of independent manufacturer s sales representatives and dealers 
since  we have increased our sales and marketing efforts through the addition of manufacturer s sales representatives  dealers and sales representatives 
our gross profit margins are affected by product mix  with the baby changing station and other family convenience products and the children s activity products typically providing higher gross profit margins than the children s modular play equipment 
the children s modular play equipment  however  has higher average selling prices and contributes to our sales growth 
in addition  sales made through dealers provide lower gross profit margins than direct sales due to the expense associated with the manufacturer s sales representatives and dealers 
to the extent we acquire additional companies or product lines  our gross profit margins may be lower than those currently achieved from sales of our current product lines due to a number of factors that may include products with higher average selling prices but lower gross margin percentages 
although our acquisitions have decreased the overall gross profit margin percentages  we believe that the addition of new products and products lines provides opportunities for revenue diversification and increased long term profitability  while also reducing our reliance on the baby changing station 
components of sales and expense we recognize sales for the majority of our operations at either the time our products are shipped  or when installation is complete in cases where we perform the installation services 
at scs interactive included in the modular play segment  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting because the build to install timeline of their jobs is of longer duration 
revenues from shipping and handling are included in sales 
cost of sales consists of components manufactured for us and direct labor and overhead incurred by us 
with the exception of the foam activity products and baby changing stations  all major components for the family convenience products and children s activity products currently are manufactured and assembled by outside vendors 
we fabricate and assemble most of our modular play products 
cost of sales also includes shipping and handling costs 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of commissions paid to manufacturer s sales representatives and other selling expenses  executive  sales  engineering and design  and office salaries  related payroll taxes  advertising expenses and depreciation on office equipment and computer hardware and software 
we provide limited warranties for our products 
we have experienced minimal returns and warranty claims  and therefore no accrual has been made for future claims except for scs  where a reserve of 
of scs s annual sales has been recorded 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty operations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
following is a discussion of some of our more critical accounting policies and judgments 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make judgments regarding these allowances based on our knowledge of the customer  historical patterns and other factors 
we have not established reserves for excess or obsolete inventories at any of our locations because we believe that all of our existing inventory is saleable for a price in excess of its carrying value 
we specifically identify inventory that we believe do not meet this criteria when we perform physical inventories and assign a carrying value based on our best estimate of net realizable value 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our intangible assets for impairment 
we have used estimates of future cash flows which take into account our anticipated results of operations 
key assumptions that we have used to develop these cash flows include estimates with respect to future sales volumes  margins and other expenses 
we believe our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to recover the goodwill under existing accounting rules and other intangible assets we have recorded as a result of acquisitions 
in  we will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
see new accounting standards below for further discussion of the impact of this implementation 
revenue at our scs division is recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
under this method  we make estimates with respect to the percentage of completion of individual jobs and recognize revenue accordingly 
we do not maintain a warranty reserve at any of our divisions other than scs 
we make judgements about the amount of warranty claims based on our knowledge of historical warranty claims 
we make judgments regarding the amount to record for future loss contingencies related to legal actions and other disputes based on the available information and consultation with our legal counsel 
the determination of our tax provision is complex and requires a number of judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets  including our ability to generate future taxable income 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will apply sfas beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately  
per share in we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we expect to complete the first step by june  based on steps we have taken to prepare for the adoption of sfas  it is possible that a portion of the unamortized goodwill will be impaired using the impairment measurement methodology required by sfas we have not yet determined the amount of the potential impairment loss  if any 
any impairment that is required to be recognized when adopting sfas will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we will complete measurement of any impairment loss upon the initial adoption of sfas by december  in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
we will adopt sfas as of january  and do not anticipate any immediate impact from the adoption of this statement 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we will adopt sfas in we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data stated as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles income from operations interest expense other income income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  sales for the fourth quarter of were million as compared to million in in the family convenience and children s activity segment  sales declined from million in to million in sales for the fourth quarter of were million compared to million in we believe the factors that contributed to this decline included a slowing economy and tightened capital budgets for our customers  a cutback in purchases by our customers as a result of the events of september and a falloff in sales of baby changing stations and other activity products that we believe is related to reductions in our direct mail program in the fourth quarter of due to the anthrax scare 
we resumed direct mailings in january of in the modular play equipment segment  sales increased from million in to million in sales for the fourth quarter of were million compared to million in the increase for the year is primarily due to the inclusion of fibar results for a full year in as compared to four months in  partially offset by a slowing economy  the impacts of the september events on the fourth quarter and a significant reduction in the higher end themed sales in the water play division 
we believe results were negatively impacted due to poor weather and reduced attendance at water parks in  which caused this segment of the market to significantly reduce their capital spending for gross profit decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the decrease in sales and a change in the sales mix  with a higher proportion of the sales coming from the modular play segment in as compared to  which has lower margins than the convenience segment 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to of sales in compared to of sales in primarily because of the impact of the lower sales relative to our fixed production costs 
offsetting this were the impacts of the personnel reductions from the operational restructuring described below 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of the increase was due to the inclusion of scs and fibar for a full year in versus ten months and four months  respectively  in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to of sales in compared to in primarily due to the lower sales 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  these cost increases were primarily due to the inclusion of the sales and marketing costs of the newly acquired businesses noted above 
general and administrative expense increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  once again  the increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of a full year of the newly acquired businesses in amortization expense from intangible assets increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to a full year of amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of scs and fibar in we used debt to finance the acquisitions of park structures in december  superior foam and smart products in  and scs and fibar in as a result  we incurred interest expense of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense as a result of the increased borrowings was partially offset by lower average interest rates during our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we have a tax benefit due to our operating losses 
the decline in our effective tax rate for is due primarily to the relationship of our non deductible goodwill to our taxable loss 
because the loss for is less than our pre tax income in  the effect of the fixed amount of non deductible goodwill is relatively larger on the effective tax rate 
as a result of the factors discussed above  we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  during the second half of  we initiated an operational restructuring with the intent of materially reducing operating costs and improving margins 
the strategy includes a consolidation of manufacturing and administrative functions into our new denver headquarters and manufacturing facility  personnel reductions  elimination of certain low margin service offerings and selected price increases 
the restructuring is currently being implemented and we expect to complete the process before the end of during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or 
we expect to make additional reductions during as we consolidate additional functions into the denver facility 
the costs associated with the reduction of our workforce in are included in selling  general and administrative expenses and were not significant 
no costs have been accrued for the potential employee reductions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  a majority of the increase resulted from sales of interactive water play equipment  playground surfacing products and foam activity products included in product lines acquired in and sales in the modular play segment accounted for million of the million increase 
sales in the convenience and activity segment accounted for 
million of the increase 
the smaller contribution by the convenience and activity segment was due primarily to the discontinuance of several children s activity products where gross margins had fallen below the targeted threshold for this segment as well as the effect of the general slowdown in orders during the fourth quarter of due to a softening of the economy  offset by increases in revenues from acquired product lines 
gross profit increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as noted above  the majority of the increase in gross profit resulted from sales of products of the newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to of sales in the period compared to of sales in the period primarily because of a change in product mix that included a higher proportion of sales of children s modular play equipment 
the gross profit percentage was also negatively impacted by higher than expected costs incurred in the modular play equipment segment  including cost overruns on several large jobs  and higher labor costs incurred in the fourth quarter and the addition of quality assurance personnel for the iso program that was certified in early selling  general and administrative expense increased  or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to of sales in the period compared to in the period primarily due to the addition of sales  legal and engineering personnel and increased product liability insurance premiums incurred as a result of higher levels of product liability insurance coverage 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  these cost increases were primarily due to the inclusion of the sales and marketing costs of the newly acquired businesses noted above 
higher expenses for various marketing programs and salaries of sales and marketing personnel added subsequent to the period also contributed to the increase 
general and administrative expense increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  once again  the increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of the newly acquired businesses in and amortization expense from intangible assets increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to the amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of superior foam and smart products in and scs and fibar in we used debt to finance the acquisitions of park structures in december  superior foam and smart products in  as well as the acquisitions of scs and fibar in as a result  we incurred interest expense of million during the year ended december  compared to 
million during the year ended december  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our worldwide effective rate was primarily due to the inclusion of a number of new state tax jurisdictions and non deductible goodwill as a result of the acquisition of scs  offset by an increase in export sales that qualify for the benefit provided by our foreign sales corporation and a one time net operating loss carryback at delta play 
net income decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  net income declined during the period compared to the period primarily due to the inclusion of a larger proportion of the children s modular play equipment line in the product mix 
net income per share diluted decreased  or  to 
for the year ended december  compared to 
for the year ended december  the percentage decrease in net income per share diluted was greater than the percentage decrease in net income as a result of an increase of 
million shares in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
seasonality and quarterly financial information unaudited our business is seasonal due primarily to the slowdown of new construction and inability to install outdoor modular play equipment and surfacing during the winter months in many parts of the country and the general slowdown of purchasing by retailers during their busy holiday season 
as a result  we typically have lower sales and gross profit in the fourth and first calendar quarters 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial information for the years ended december  and the information has been derived from unaudited statements of operations data that we believe are stated on a basis consistent with the audited financial statements and include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
shipping and handling costs in the first three quarters of and all quarters in have been reclassified from revenues to cost of sales to be consistent with the current year end presentation 
these reclassifications had no impact on net income or cash flows

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and from cash advanced under our revolving bank line of credit 
in addition  we have financed various acquisitions using cash advanced under the line of credit 
we increased the maximum amount available under our secured line of credit with us bank us  agent for various lenders  to million on november  the interest rate on amounts borrowed under the line of credit was based on the applicable reserve adjusted libor rate or the bank s prime rate 
at december   the reserve adjusted libor rate was while the bank s prime rate was  compared to and at december   respectively 
in the third quarter of  we amended and restated our existing credit facility and established a revolving credit facility in the amount of million and a term loan in the amount of million the new credit facility 
this facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and requires compliance with financial loan covenants related to leverage  interest coverage  fixed charges and capital expenditures 
availability under the revolving credit facility is determined by a formula based on inventory and accounts receivable balances 
a commitment fee of 
per annum is payable quarterly based on the average daily unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on this facility is the bank s prime rate plus 
the bank s prime rate was at december  the term loan is due september  the revolving credit facility is due september  there was million outstanding under the credit facility as of december   and million outstanding as of december  at september   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants for maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio 
we obtained a waiver of such non compliance which is contained in amendment no 
to the new credit facility 
the waiver required  among other things  the infusion of million of capital into the company by march   which would be used to reduce the amounts outstanding under the term loan  and sets new covenants 
at december   we were again in default of certain covenants under that indebtedness and anticipated  based on our expected results  that we would be in default throughout on april   we obtained a waiver of such non compliance which is contained in amendment no 
to the new credit facility 
under the amendment  the due date of our line of credit has been extended to april   the date to obtain the million of additional capital is changed to april   the quarterly payments for have been reduced to  per quarter and the covenants have been reset 
the amendment also requires us to make up to million in additional principal payments on april  if we meet certain ebitda targets during we have engaged an investment banker to assist us with raising the additional financing 
cash provided by used in operating activities for  and was million  
million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from changes in working capital items as a result of our focus on improving collections and reducing inventories 
the decrease for the year ended december  resulted primarily from funding higher levels of working capital required to support our growth  primarily inventory and overpayment of estimated tax installments in working capital as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively  and cash balances were and 
million for and the relatively low cash balances are the result of our practice of applying all excess cash against the line of credit to minimize interest expense payable on the line of credit 
we have used our operating cash flow and borrowings under our line of credit primarily for the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the acquisition and development new products and product lines  capital expenditures and working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in  we made payments of 
million for holdbacks and earnouts on prior acquisitions 
in  million was used to purchase scs and fibar 
in  million was used to purchase the assets of park structures  superior foam and smart products 
the balance was primarily devoted to capital expenditures for fixed assets  intellectual property and an advance in to one of our officers related to the exercise of stock options in net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of funds in primarily represents the net payments on our line of credit and term loan 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price in for scs and fibar with the revolving credit facility from the bank 
we funded the acquisition of park structures in through a combination of existing cash balances and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in  we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option on a secondary offering we completed in our backlog of orders is comprised primarily of orders from our customers in the modular play equipment segment 
the amount of backlog at any given point in time will vary due to customers seasonal buying patterns and our production capacity 
the backlog of orders was million at december  and approximately million at december  we were not materially affected by changing raw materials prices except for polyethylene prices in  which increased materially due to the increase in costs for all petroleum based products experienced in the united states during the year 
our revolving line of credit and term loan will require significant cash payments in the future 
we have various other contractual obligations  primarily lease agreements  that also require significant future cash payments 
the table below summarizes these future obligations 
contractual obligations total less than years years after years year revolving line of credit   term loan    capital leases    acquisition payments   operating leases      total      in addition to the above  our term loan requires additional payments of up to million by april  if we meet certain ebitda targets for and requires payments of up to of our excess cash flow as defined 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and the unused capacity under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
we are required under our amended loan agreements to obtain an additional million of capital by april  to reduce amounts currently outstanding under our term loan 
if it appears that we will not meet the covenant targets  we will consider taking additional cost reduction steps which could include employee reductions and other spending cuts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates is related primarily to our line of credit  which accrues interest at an adjustable rate 
we do not believe that the future market risks will have material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity  a variance in the interest rate of will result in a change in diluted earnings per share of approximately per share 
delta play is located in canada near vancouver  british columbia 
delta play s sales to customers outside canada and a certain amount of our raw material purchases are transacted in united states dollars 
sales to customers within canada  labor costs and certain raw material purchases are transacted in canadian dollars 
the fluctuation in the exchange rate between united states dollars and canadian dollars during and did not materially affect our business during or and we do not believe  based on historical trends  that future exchange rate fluctuations will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity
