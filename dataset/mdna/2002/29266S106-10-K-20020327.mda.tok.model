item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview organizational history we were formed in  and our common stock began trading publicly in the current radiance medical systems  inc resulted from our acquisition of the portion of our former radiance medical systems subsidiary that we did not already own 
we originally incorporated the former radiance 
table of contents as a separate entity to focus on the research and development of radiation therapy to treat cardiovascular disease  and to obtain outside sources of financing for such research and development 
in january  we paid approximately million in stock   in cash  and million in common stock options to acquire the portion of the former radiance that we did not already own 
in addition  the stockholders and option holders of the former radiance could have received product development milestone payments of for each share of preferred stock and for each share of common stock 
however  no milestones were met note to the consolidated financial statements 
our business we have developed proprietary devices to deliver radiation to prevent the recurrence of blockages in arteries following balloon angioplasty  vascular stenting and other interventional treatments of blockages in coronary and peripheral arteries 
we incorporate our proprietary rdx technology into catheter based systems that deliver beta radiation to the site of a treated blockage in an artery in order to decrease the likelihood of restenosis 
the application of beta radiation inside the artery at the site of a blockage has proven clinically effective in inhibiting cell proliferation  a cause of restenosis 
we designed the rdx system to provide safe and effective treatment for the prevention of restenosis without many of the disadvantages inherent in alternative radiation delivery systems 
our proprietary rdx system carries a radiation source on an inflatable balloon catheter 
this patented technology allows the rdx system to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation with approximately less total radiation activity than competing systems 
as a result  the rdx system is easier to use  does not require supplemental capital equipment  and is readily disposable 
in addition  we believe that the rdx system is suitable to treat arteries that are significantly larger and smaller than can be treated with alternative radiation delivery systems 
prior to june  we focused on manufacturing and selling a broad range of angioplasty catheters and stent products  including our focus technology product line 
as catheter and stent products became widely available and were subject to increasing price pressure  we shifted our focus to the research and development of radiation therapy devices to treat restenosis 
since june  we have licensed our proprietary focus technology for balloon angioplasty to guidant corporation for use in guidant s stent delivery systems  acquired the portion of our former radiance medical systems subsidiary that we did not already own  which was researching and developing radiation therapy treatment devices to prevent blockages in arteries following interventional treatments  sold our vascular access product line and related assets  reduced our direct sales force  and  restructured our operations beginning in september in the first quarter of  we began two us clinical trials of the rdx system 
one trial  brite ii  is a randomized  pivotal trial to test the effectiveness of the rdx system for in stent restenosis  and the other trial  brite svg  is a feasibility study for de novo and in stent restenosis in saphenous vein bypass grafts 
in the second quarter of  we began an international feasibility clinical trial  rapid  of the rdx system for treating restenosis in two main vessels in the leg  the femoral and popliteal arteries 
as of december   we had completed enrollment in the brite ii patients and in the brite svg trials patients 
of the total of patients to be enrolled in the rapid trial  as of december   we had enrolled patients 
we expect that enrollment in the rapid trial will be completed in the second quarter of over the past few years  our source of revenues has shifted gradually from direct sales to royalties from licenses involving our products 
in june  we entered into a technology license agreement with guidant corporation  granting guidant rights  including exclusive rights in the united states  to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents 
in exchange  we 
table of contents received milestone payments based upon the transfer of the technological knowledge to guidant  and continue to receive royalty payments based upon the sale of products by guidant using the focus technology 
the payments under the guidant license are the primary source of our existing revenues note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have experienced an operating loss for each of the last three years and could continue to incur operating losses through at least our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter  and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary significantly in the future 
our quarterly operating results depend upon several factors  including the timing and amount of expenses associated with clinical testing of the rdx system  the progress and success of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  varying product sales by our licensee  and  outcomes from future partnering or technology acquisition agreements  if any 
we discontinued the sale of focus technology products in the fourth quarter of therefore  revenues in the future are almost entirely dependent on license fees from our focus technology license agreement with guidant 
as work is completed on our clinical studies in the next twelve months  our expenses will be significantly reduced  but they will remain relatively fixed 
recent developments and company restructuring in september and november  three companies published the first feasibility clinical study data for drug coated stents  a competing technology to our rdx system 
while our rdx system uses beta radiation to treat restenosis resulting from angioplasty procedures  drug coated stents have drugs that inhibit cell proliferation to limit restenosis 
though drug coated stent feasibility trials were on a relatively small cohort of patients  all three companies reported restenosis rates near or at zero percent 
in addition  in march clinical investigators for johnson johnson reported positive data involving drug coated stents that showed zero restenosis after a month period 
finally  in addition to the positive data regarding the ability of drug coated stents to treat de novo restenosis recently released brazilian research data from a small two year study of patients indicates that drug coated stents are effective in treating in stent restenosis 
unless clinical study data involving drug coated stents from the pivotal  larger studies planned or in progress show restenosis rates significantly higher than reported in pilot studies  the market for the rdx system likely will be limited 
as a result  in order to conserve cash prior to assessing the outcome of our brite ii clinical study and deciding whether to make our rdx system coronary pma filing  and to position ourselves to take advantage of strategic alternatives  we decided in september to restructure our operations 
our restructuring plan consisted of the following discontinue marketing and manufacturing of the rdx system in europe and other international markets in the third quarter of  discontinue marketing and manufacturing of products using our focus technology subject to fulfillment of outstanding orders  cease clinical trials for the rdx system in japan  involuntary termination of employees  which we completed in the first quarter of  and search for additional commercial opportunities by evaluating technologies outside of radiation therapy 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded a  charge  comprised of manufacturing facility set up and sub license fees and non cancelable commitments under the agreements with bebig   in other non cancelable commitments   for the write off of inventory that will not be used 
table of contents to fulfill the outstanding focus technology product orders  million for employee termination benefits and  for other exit costs 
in addition  we concluded that certain rdx technology equipment and tangible assets  previously acquired in fiscal related to the rdx technology  were impaired resulting in a charge of  and million 
we concluded the assets would not generate future cash flows 
because we also decided to cease manufacturing of the focus technology product line  subject to fulfillment of outstanding orders  we recorded a charge of  for equipment used in the production of focus technology products 
we also wrote off  for the carrying value of furniture  computers  software and leasehold improvements that were no longer being used 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of facility needs and recorded a  restructuring charge for non cancelable lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income of following the restructuring  the remaining workforce of nine people is assigned to complete the brite ii pivotal clinical trial and the brite svg and rapid feasibility clinical trials  as well as to identify strategic partners and promising technology 
once the brite ii clinical trial is complete and pivotal clinical trial data on drug coated stents is available  we will decide whether to file for pma for the rdx system 
future operations based on the preliminary results from clinical studies involving drug coated stents  we believe the market for our rdx system likely will be limited 
we have agreed to acquire endologix  inc for the opportunity to develop an alternative technology and to manufacture and market a medical device based on this technology that potentially represents a more promising commercial market 
therefore  if stockholders approve and the merger is consummated  we expect to begin combining the operations of endologix with ours immediately 
although we plan to complete our remaining clinical trials involving the rdx system  unless initial positive results from studies involving competing drug coated stent technologies prove inaccurate  we expect that our ongoing operations following completion of the merger primarily will be research and development of endologix s technology  and the production and distribution of the endologix product s 
definitive merger agreement in february  we signed a definitive merger agreement with endologix  inc the merger is subject to radiance s and endologix shareholders approval and other customary closing conditions 
endologix is a developer and manufacturer of minimally invasive treatment of vascular diseases 
endologix lead technology is the powerlink system  an endoluminal stent graft elg for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we will issue for each share of endologix common stock  for an aggregate amount of cash not to exceed million and one share of our common stock for each share of endologix common stock  not to exceed an aggregate issuance of  shares 
in addition  we may pay contingent consideration in the amount of million in the event pre market approval  or pma  is received for the powerlink system on or before march   or million if pma approval is received by june  we may choose to pay the contingent consideration  if payable  in cash or common stock at our sole discretion 
the merger agreement also provides for the cancellation of endologix treasury stock and  shares of endologix common stock  or of the fully diluted equity of endologix  that we own 
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger  each endologix common shareholder can elect to receive all or a portion of the merger consideration  excluding any milestone payment  in either cash or stock 
if the aggregate amount of cash or stock to be paid by us is insufficient to satisfy all shareholders after we have paid the shareholders who elected to receive cash and stock consideration in a percentage 
table of contents equal to the same percentage of cash and stock we have determined to pay  the remaining consideration will be paid pro rata in accordance with the relative amounts of cash or stock indicated by such remaining shareholder payment elections 
any excess cash or stock  above the amounts elected by endologix shareholders  shall be paid pro rata to the shareholders based on the number of shares of endologix common stock held by each shareholder immediately prior to the effective time of the merger 
notwithstanding any other provision of the agreement  in no event shall the total amount of cash to be paid by us exceed of the total of all of the merger consideration  valuing each share of our common stock at its nasdaq market closing price on the day immediately preceding the payment date of the merger consideration 
endologix shareholders who do not vote in favor of the merger  has perfected such holder s right to an appraisal of the value of their holdings 
endologix will not voluntarily settle any dissenting shareholder s demand for appraisal or make any settlement offers without our prior consent 
in addition  we have agreed to loan endologix up to million in the event the merger is not completed 
the loan will be collateralized by a first priority security interest on all of endologix intellectual property  and will be due on the earlier of october  or upon the closing by endologix of an equity or debt financing of million or more  a merger in which endologix is not the surviving entity  or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets 
significant accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  radiance evaluates its estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
radiance bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
radiance believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowances for accounts receivable and inventory  long lived assets  including intangible assets  and income taxes 
radiance maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on the company s review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to the company indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
radiance writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we revised our estimate of demand for our focus technology products in  which resulted in the write down of inventory 
radiance records an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations  such as our decision to discontinue new sales of our focus product  adverse market conditions or the introduction of competing technologies  such as drug coated stents  among other things  could cause us to write down the asset ie  record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
radiance reduces its deferred tax assets to zero due to uncertainties concerning the 
table of contents future realization of the related tax benefits  primarily due to our history of losses 
in the event radiance was to determine that it would be able to realize some or all of the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance would be reduced  resulting in increased income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   as a result of increased competition for angioplasty catheter and stent products 
because we discontinued manufacturing and marketing of our focus technology products as part of our restructuring plan  we anticipate only minor product sales in from our existing products 
however  we have signed a definitive merger agreement with endologix 
if the shareholders of both companies approve the merger  the amount and composition of our product sales could change in the future 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  our technology license agreement with guidant resulted in million in royalties in each of and in addition  we recognized  in minimum royalties in and  in minimum royalties in  under our agreement with escalon medical corporation escalon 
we currently do not expect to receive more than the minimum royalties due under the escalon agreement  which we will recognize as revenue when cash is collected due to the uncertainty as to whether escalon has the ability to pay the amounts due under the agreement 
the source of license revenues is primarily royalties received from sales of licensed products by guidant 
thus  changes in guidant s sales of licensed products will significantly impact future revenues 
although the license agreement with guidant expires in june  if at any time guidant discontinued selling licensed products  we would not receive royalties from them in excess of the minimum annual amount of  cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in product sales to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   partially offset by an increase in cost of product sales of  due to inventory reserves for expired products 
although sales decreased  because cost of sales includes costs that are fixed and do not vary with production  the cost of sales for did not decrease by the same percentage 
cost of sales from restructuring 
due to our restructuring and discontinuance of the marketing of existing products that we announced in the third quarter of  we wrote off  of inventory that would not be used to fulfill existing customer orders 
we do not anticipate any more write offs of inventory due to the restructuring 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  was due primarily to the inventory write off of  as a result of the restructuring  a decrease in product sales of million because of increasing competition and the aging of our focus technology product line  and a decrease in license revenue of  under the escalon agreement following its amendment in february gross profit on product sales decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   due primarily to a decrease in product sales of million and the fixed cost component of cost of sales that does not vary with production 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the primary 
table of contents reason for this increase was additional spending on clinical trials and development of pilot production for the rdx system 
because we discontinued new research and development projects as part of our restructuring plan  we anticipate materially lower research and development expenses in for our existing technology 
if the merger with endologix is approved  because they are conducting research and development projects and a pivotal us clinical trial  and plan future clinical trials  our research and development expenses for the newly combined company could be significantly higher than our current projection for marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the expiration of a marketing allowance for cathex  our japanese focus technology distributor  in the fourth quarter of because we discontinued marketing and sales of our existing products as part of our restructuring plan  we do not anticipate any marketing and sales expenses in for our existing products 
endologix is marketing its powerlink system in europe and is spending funds to develop its international sales and distribution network 
because of this  if the merger is approved  our marketing and sales expenses could be significantly higher than our current forecast for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to lower bonus and payroll expenses from personnel reductions 
we anticipate that general and administration expenses for will be materially lower than for  unless the merger with endologix is approved 
assuming that the merger is approved  we still anticipate that the total general and administration expense for will be comparable to that of restructuring charges 
we recognized restructuring charges totaling million in the year ended december  the charges consisted of a million impairment charge for previously acquired rdx developed technology  million of involuntary employee termination costs  a  impairment charge for manufacturing and other operating assets   charge  comprised of manufacturing facility setup and sub license fees and non cancelable commitments under agreements with bebig   in other non cancelable commitments   of non cancelable lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income of  and  of other non cancelable commitments and exit costs 
other income expense 
other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  interest income was million in each of the years ended december  and gain on sale of assets decreased to  in from million in the primary source for the gain on sale of assets was the sale of an option to purchase an equity investment  which expired without exercise in december comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in january  we sold our vascular access product line and related assets and acquired the former radiance 
as a result of increased competition for angioplasty catheter products  sales of our focus technology products decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in year ended december  as a result of our sale of the vascular access product line  there were no sales of vascular access products in the year ended december  compared to  in sales in the year ended december  license revenue 
license fee and other revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in  we signed a technology license agreement with guidant  which resulted in million in milestone related license fees and  in royalties in and million in royalties in in addition  in each of and  we recognized  in minimum royalties under the agreement with escalon 

table of contents cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in sales to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in gross profit for the year ended december  was due primarily a million increase in license revenue  for which there is no associated cost of sales  and was partially offset by a decrease in product sales 
gross profit on product sales decreased to  in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  although product sales decreased  the decrease in gross profit for product sales was just because a larger percentage of the product sales for were in markets where we charged more for the same products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the primary reason for this increase was additional spending on clinical trials and development of pilot production for the rdx system 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease primarily was the result of the expiration of a marketing allowance for cathex  our japanese focus technology distributor  in the fourth quarter of reductions in our international sales force and related expenses also contributed to the decrease in expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to  in legal costs associated with the endosonics litigation and higher bad debt expense of  in compared with charge for acquired in process research and development 
we recognized a charge of million in the year ended december  we incurred the charge for the acquisition in january of the shares of the former radiance medical systems that we did not already own 
other income expense 
other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  interest income increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in interest income was due primarily to an increase in invested cash from our secondary offering in october gain on sale of assets decreased to million in from million in as the gain included the sale of the assets of the vascular access product line and related assets 
the primary source for the gain on sale of assets was the sale of an option to purchase certain equity investments held by us 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily by selling our equity securities  obtaining advances from endosonics  our former parent company  licensing our technologies  and  entering into international product distribution agreements 
prior to our initial public offering in  we raised an aggregate of approximately million from the private sales of preferred and common stock and million in working capital advances from endosonics  which we repaid during the third quarter of 
table of contents in the second quarter of  we closed our initial public offering of common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering 
in the third quarter of  scimed life systems  inc exercised  common stock warrants  obtained from us through a stock purchase and technology license agreement  for  we also received  from the sale of  shares of our common stock to cathex  ltd 
under a may agreement that gave cathex exclusive product distribution rights in japan for our existing products until january  we agreed to terminate the distribution agreement with cathex in the fourth quarter of in january  we also sold substantially all of our vascular access product line and related assets to escalon medical corporation for approximately million 
in lieu of minimum royalties payable through january  we are receiving periodic payments of interest and principal under a note with a face value of  note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  we granted cosmotec co  ltd 
of japan the exclusive distribution rights to market our vascular radiation therapy products in japan 
we received million from cosmotec as an upfront cash payment and began recognizing income ratably over the estimated seven year term of the agreement 
as part of the transaction with cosmotec  in august  we acquired a interest  for  in a joint venture named radiatec  with an affiliate of cosmotec to gain regulatory approval of and provide distribution for the rdx system in japan 
we borrowed million from cosmotec and recorded million in debt in june to reflect the fair value of the  million face amount convertible debenture 
on september   cosmotec converted the debenture into  shares of our common stock at per share note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  we entered into a two year contract manufacturing agreement with bebig gmbh bebig to activate the radioactive sources and complete final assembly of the rdx system in europe 
pursuant to the agreement  which was amended in july  we paid  during and were committed to pay approximately  in of certain facility set up fees 
in february  we agreed to second and third amendments of the manufacturing agreement 
the second amendment called for the expansion of the production capacity  and we were committed to pay additional fees of approximately  in  bringing the total fees for to approximately million 
during  we paid all of the aforementioned fees following the achievement of manufacturing milestones by bebig  with the exception of a portion of one milestone for  that bebig did not complete before manufacturing was discontinued following our restructuring note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we completed the preparation of certain manufacturing equipment to be used by bebig to perform the final assembly of the rdx system during the second quarter of and bebig purchased it for  which approximated our cost 
the third amendment  which had a one year term  increased the amount we would pay bebig for each unit produced and set a minimum facility charge 
we also agreed to pay all material and third party costs associated with production validation and an agreed amount for each unit produced 
in  we paid a total of  for minimum facility fees   for reimbursement of third party costs for charges incurred prior to the discontinuance of manufacturing following our restructuring  and  in non cancelable commitments through the term of the manufacturing agreement 
in may  we agreed to a fourth amendment to the agreement under which bebig would fulfill customer service functions for an annual fee of  in  we paid  in fees for services performed and the remaining  excluding  in associated taxes  for the non cancelable commitment under the agreement through april in conjunction with the contract manufacturing agreement  we entered into a three year sub license agreement with bebig for radiation technology that we believed might be useful in the development of its radiation therapy products 
during  we recorded  in license fee expense and paid an 
table of contents additional  for license rights through november all license fees due under the license agreement for prior periods were offset by payments under the manufacturing agreement 
the sub license was subject to renewal  without cost  until the underlying patents expiration dates 
we have expensed  as research and development costs  all costs associated with the contract manufacturing and license agreements with bebig  except those expensed as restructuring costs 
in september  we implemented a restructuring plan that included the discontinuance of european manufacturing note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the remaining non cancelable contractual commitments due under the agreements with bebig  including the remaining minimum sub license fee totaling  was included as a component of the restructuring charge that we paid in the fourth quarter of we did not owe any amounts to bebig at december  as a result of the restructuring  at december  we had  in accrued liabilities  of which  will be paid in and  will be paid in net cash used in operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used resulted primarily from higher research  development and clinical expenses for compared with due to our restructuring  we believe that research and development expenses will decrease for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   without taking into account the increase that would result if we complete the merger with endologix 
if the merger with endologix is approved  we anticipate that net cash used in operating activities will be somewhat less than that for at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of million 
we expect to incur substantial costs related to  among other things  us clinical testing prior to achieving positive cash flow from operations in late we anticipate that our cash and anticipated revenues from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the second quarter of however  if the merger with endologix is approved by both company s shareholders  we will pay million to endologix shareholders as part of the merger consideration and our capital requirements will be substantially higher 
moreover  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including approval of the merger with endologix  our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the regulatory approval process  the costs involved in intellectual property rights enforcement or litigation  competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties  and  the ability to develop technology and to commercialize products 
we likely will need to raise funds through additional financings  including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with existing or new corporate partners 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to grant rights to technologies or products that we would not otherwise grant 
trade accounts receivable  net  decreased to  at december  from  at december  the decrease resulted primarily from lower product sales 

table of contents other receivables decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is attributable primarily to the  reimbursement of a portion of the secondary offering costs by endosonics corporation  and a  decrease in royalty revenue receivable from escalon medical corporation  partially offset by an increase of  in royalty revenue receivable from guidant corporation 
inventory decreased to  at december  from million at december  the decrease was due primarily to the write off of  of excess and unsalable inventories because we discontinued rdx catheter and focus technology production under the restructuring plan 
the decrease in inventories also was due to the disposal of focus technology related inventories because of our estimation of decreasing demand 
property and equipment  net  decreased to  at december  from  at december   due primarily to an impairment charge of  in september as part of our restructuring 
intangibles  net  which were comprised of acquired  developed rdx technology and the acquired value of the assembled rdx workforce  decreased to zero at december  from million at december  this decrease was due to amortization of  in  followed by an impairment charge of million taken at the end of the third quarter following our decision to restructure and to discontinue rdx system sales 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was attributable to higher accruals for clinical expenditures of  and accrued restructuring expenses  including  for involuntary employee terminations and  for non cancelable commitments 
deferred revenue decreased to  at december  from  at december  the decrease was due to continuing amortization of deferred distributor fees from cosmotec note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
an investment involves a high degree of risk 
risks related to our business we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability 
from our formation in to december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  and incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  we expect to be profitable in  but it is possible that we may never achieve profitability 
because endologix management does not anticipate profitable operations for at least the next two years  the pending merger with endologix  if approved  will result in combined operations that we expect will be unprofitable for at least the next two years 
we will not seek u 
s 
regulatory approval of the rdx system if we don t believe that it can compete against drug coated stents or other rival products 
unless clinical study data involving drug coated stents from the pivotal  larger studies planned or in progress show restenosis rates significantly higher than reported in pilot studies  the market for the rdx system likely will be limited 
depending upon our estimate of the market for our rdx system  based on 
table of contents the clinical data for drug coated stents or other products  we may not seek us regulatory approval to market the rdx system 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals for the rdx system 
we need to complete a us pivotal human clinical trial for the rdx system 
the rdx system is the only product we have under development and it has not been approved for marketing by the food and drug administration  or fda 
prior to granting approval  the fda may require more information or clarification of information provided in our regulatory submissions  or more clinical studies  which could require significant additional expenditures 
if granted  the fda may impose limitations on the uses for which or how we may market the rdx system 
should we experience delays or be unable to obtain regulatory approvals  we may never generate significant revenues  and our business prospects will be substantially impaired 
even if we receive necessary regulatory approval  we may not be able to commercialize the rdx system successfully 
the rdx system and any other product that we choose to develop require significant testing 
our development of products is subject to the risks of failure commonly experienced in the development of new products based on innovative or novel technologies 
any or all of these proposed technologies and products might prove to be ineffective  unsafe or uneconomical to manufacture commercially 
even if our products are safe and effective  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture or market them successfully  either on our own or through third parties  or that we will manage the expansion of our operations successfully 
if we receive regulatory approval for our products and decide to market them  we will need to grow rapidly 
rapid growth may strain the capabilities of our managers  operations and facilities and  consequently  could harm our business 
if we obtain the required u 
s 
regulatory approval for the rdx system  commercial scale production will require us to expand our operations 
rapid growth may strain our managerial and other organizational resources 
our ability to manage our growth will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to operate or contract with production facilities that can handle the radiation sources required for the manufacture of the rdx system  manage the simultaneous manufacture of different products efficiently and integrate the manufacture of new products with existing product lines  address difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel  and  implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
we rely on a single vendor to supply our radioactive sources and perform final assembly of the rdx system  and any disruption in our supply could delay or prevent us from completing our clinical trials 
although we did manufacture components and sub assemblies for the rdx system  we do not apply the beta radiation 
currently  we rely on a small  us based manufacturer to supply us with radioactive source balloons for use in clinical trials 
in addition  our reliance on sole source manufacturers exposes our operations to disruptions in supply caused by failure of our suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements  any strike or work stoppage  
table of contents disruptions in shipping  a natural disaster caused by fire  floods or earthquakes  a supply shortage experienced by our sole source manufacturer  and the fiscal health and manufacturing strength of our contract manufacturer 
the occurrence of any of the above disruptions in supply or other unforeseen events that could cause a disruption in supply from our sole source contract manufacturer likely would cause us to halt or delay our clinical trials 
because of the short shelf life of the rdx system  it is unlikely that we would have sufficient inventory to mitigate the adverse impact of any supply disruption 
in addition  the risk of a supply disruption could occur because our supplier fails to comply with extensive radiation safety regulations in the united states 
the complexity of these regulations and the danger inherent in handling radioactive material increases the possibility of a supply disruption by one of our contract manufacturers 
because we do not have alternative suppliers and manufacturers  our sales and profitability would be harmed in the event of a disruption 
the short shelf life of the rdx system will require us to develop an efficient distribution system and increases the likelihood of product waste  reduced margins and losses 
the beta radiation we use in the rdx system has a relatively short half life 
therefore  we expect the rdx system to have a shelf life of approximately days  which will make it critical for us and for our contract manufacturers to ship the products as close to the date of use as possible before the radioactive isotope decays into stable  non radioactive elements 
to do this  we will need to develop an efficient distribution system with a high degree of coordination among a contract manufacturer  the distributor  the shipping carrier  the end user and us if we eventually market the product in the us if we fail to establish adequate shipping and logistic capabilities or manufacturing sources  we will be unable to commercialize the rdx system successfully 
moreover  even if we establish an efficient distribution system  any disruption or lack of coordination will result in product waste  which would reduce our margins and may make sales of the rdx system unprofitable 
we are currently only developing a single technology  the rdx system  and are seeking new technology to add to our potential product base 
if we do not complete the merger with endologix  we will have only one product technology  which may be obsolete 
although we are seeking new technology  we may not be able to identify a technology suitable for our business that can be obtained on acceptable terms 
we have agreed to merge with endologix but need to obtain shareholder approval to consummate the transaction 
if the shareholders of both companies do not approve the merger  the rdx system will remain our only technology in development 
based on initial data from clinical studies involving drug coated stents  a competing technology to our rdx system  we believe the market for the rdx system likely will be limited 
our operations are capital intensive  and we may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our operations 
our activities are capital intensive 
although our current cash balance should be sufficient to reach fda approval for the rdx system if we seek approval  it may not be sufficient to fund the development of both the rdx system and endologix s powerlink system to fda approval  if we complete the merger with endologix 
although we believe that our cash and anticipated revenues from operations will be sufficient to meet our planned capital requirements at least through the second quarter of  we most likely will require additional capital thereafter 
our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors  including whether we complete the merger with endologix  the scope and results of our clinical trials  
table of contents the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the establishment of high volume manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  and  our success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties 
to finance these activities  we may seek funds through additional rounds of financing  including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
we may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms  or not at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we issue debt securities  these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock  and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations 
we might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies  product candidates or products that we otherwise would not relinquish 
if adequate funds are not available  we might have to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which would impair our future prospects 
the use of radioactive material in our product may increase our risk in the event of product liability claims or accidental exposure 
our third party manufacturer must comply with extensive radiation safety regulations in the united states that govern the import export  manufacture  distribution  use and disposal of radioactive materials 
for example bebig and any other manufacturer  supplier and distributor must obtain licenses from united states and international nuclear regulators  as applicable  such as the us nrc  to distribute radiation sources commercially  bebig or any other manufacturer  supplier and distributor must comply with us or international nuclear regulations  us department of transportation and international air transport association regulations  as applicable  governing the labeling and packaging requirements for shipment of radiation sources to hospitals or to the other users of the rdx system  and hospitals may need to obtain or expand their licenses to use and handle beta radiation prior to using the rdx system 
violations of these regulations and laws by us  our suppliers or our distributors  or any malfunctions of our system or errors by hospitals and physicians in administering treatment  could result in accidental contamination or injury  as well as unexpected remedial costs and penalties 
any such violation or incident could lead to suspension of our trials of the rdx system 
regulatory enforcement action such as civil penalties or license suspension or revocation likewise could lead to suspension of our clinical trials 
even if our clinical trials are not affected  we may need to spend substantial funds to litigate and defend ourselves from any claims or pay any settlements 
in addition  because the rdx system is a new treatment  any similar regulatory violations or incidents involving our competitors could reduce the likelihood of regulatory approval for the rdx system or could delay or erode acceptance of the rdx system by physicians and patients 
in the event of an accidental release of radioactive material into a patient  we may face significant liability to the patient  to medical personnel exposed to the release and to other third parties affected by the exposure 
although we maintain product liability insurance  in the event of such a release  our liability would be difficult to estimate  as it would depend on such factors as the nature and extent of the exposure to the radiation and the probable long term effects of such an exposure 
the liability could materially exceed our product liability insurance limits 

table of contents our primary source of revenues is our focus technology license agreement with guidant 
our current and future revenues depend on the number of stent delivery systems that incorporate our focus technology that are sold by guidant corporation 
approximately of our total revenues in the year ended december  were revenues pursuant to a license agreement with guidant 
this agreement grants guidant the right to manufacture and distribute stent delivery products using our focus technology  including exclusive rights within the united states 
under the agreement  we receive royalty payments based upon the sale of products using the focus technology 
we expect that our revenues from the guidant license agreement will decline over the next few years as technological changes in the stent market make our focus stent technology obsolete 
our revenues may decline precipitously  and our business may be harmed  if guidant terminates the license agreement  is unable to sell stent delivery systems that incorporate our focus technology  or does not incorporate our focus technology into future generations of its stent delivery systems 
we will need to devote significant resources to market our products and technology to physicians in order to achieve market acceptance 
if we fail to achieve market acceptance  our business will suffer 
although the fda has approved a johnson johnson gamma radiation device and a novoste beta radiation device  we believe that unless clinical study data involving drug coated stents from pivotal  larger studies show restenosis rates significantly higher than reported for feasibility studies  physicians are unlikely to accept vascular radiation therapy products 
we also cannot predict how the short shelf life of our products will affect clinical acceptance by physicians 
other companies may have superior resources to market similar products or technologies or have superior technologies and products to market 
therefore  even if our products gain regulatory approval  we will need to spend significant resources prior to achieving market acceptance 
any failure of our products to achieve commercial acceptance  or any inability on our part to devote the requisite resources necessary to market our products  will harm our business 
we may rely on third party distributors to sell and market any product we develop 
they may do so ineffectively 
we may depend on medical device distributors and strategic relationships  some of which may be with our competitors  to distribute the rdx system or any other product we develop 
significant consolidation among medical device suppliers has made it increasingly difficult for smaller suppliers like us to distribute products effectively without a relationship with one or more of the major suppliers 
consequently  we may enter into agreements with third parties to distribute any product we develop 
if we enter into such relationships  we will depend directly on their efforts to market the any product we develop  yet we will be unable to control their efforts completely 
if our distributors fail to market and sell our products effectively  our operating results and business may suffer substantially  or we may have to make significant additional expenditures to market our products 
the rdx system relies upon our non exclusive sub license of the hehrlein patents from bebig 
we may lose the rights to the hehrlein patents and be forced to re configure our existing base technology and seek new regulatory approvals 
we own two united states patent and own several pending patent applications relating to the proprietary devices comprising the rdx system 
we also have obtained a non exclusive license from bebig to utilize technology covered by the hehrlein patents concerning the uniform application of radiation to a balloon 
the license with bebig expires in november  although either party may renew the sub license through the date that the license expires  at which time the rights to the hehrlein patents will revert to hehrlein 
if we subsequently decide to market the rdx system  we may be unable to obtain the rights to the hehrlein patents 
furthermore  either party may terminate the sub license for material breach 
in the event that bebig terminates the sub license  we may be forced to re design the rdx 
table of contents system to allow for the application of radiation to the balloon catheter in a manner that is still effective in treating restenosis  and also may need to seek new regulatory approvals  which would substantially delay product sales 
the market for our products is highly competitive  and competing medical device technologies  especially drug coated stents  may prove more effective in treating these conditions than our product candidates 
competition in the market for devices used in the treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease is intense  and we expect it to increase 
the rdx system and other potential products will compete with treatment methods that are well established in the medical community  as well as treatments based on new technologies  such as drug coated stents 
we face competition from manufacturers of other catheter based atherectomy devices  vascular stents and pharmaceutical products intended to treat vascular disease 
drug coated stents are the most likely competitive device we face 
however  even in the event drug coated stents do not prove to be as effective as initial clinical data indicates  we also would expect to face competition from treatments based on technologies that novoste corporation  johnson johnson  guidant and others are developing 
the most significant treatments  other than drug coated stents  that pose a competitive challenge to us include novoste s beta radiation seed based system  which is available in the us and europe  johnson johnson s gamma radiation wire based system  which is available in the us and europe  guidant s beta radiation wire based system  drugs  other radioactive wire based systems  and other technologies in various phases of development  including gene therapy  x ray and ultrasound 
any of these treatments could prove to be more effective or may achieve greater market acceptance than the rdx system 
even if these treatments are not as effective as the rdx system  many of the companies pursuing these treatments and technologies have significantly greater financial  management and other resources  more extensive research and development capability  the mix between pilot production of new products and full scalle manufacturing of existing products  established market positions  larger sales and marketing organizations  and  variations in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  we believe that many of the purchasers and potential purchasers of our competitors products prefer to purchase catheter and stent products from a single source 
accordingly  many of our competitors  because of their size and range of product offerings  will have an advantage over us 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this fluctuation may negatively impact our stock price in the future 
because the rdx system is still in the research and development phase  we cannot predict when  if ever  we will have revenues based on the us sales of the rdx system 
also  our current revenues are attributable primarily to a license agreement with guidant  which limits our ability to predict future 
table of contents revenues 
moreover  we expect revenues pursuant to the license agreement with guidant to diminish in the future as technology changes 
in addition to the foregoing factors  our quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to the conduct of clinical trials  the timing of regulatory approvals  fluctuations in our expenses associated with expanding our operations  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  and  changes in third party payors reimbursement policies 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparison of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock  which could cause you to lose some or all of the value of your investment 
risks related to our industry our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the fda and similar agencies in foreign countries 
these requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities  an extensive fda review process and other costly and time consuming procedures 
it often takes companies several years to satisfy these requirements  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
we also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
some of the most important requirements we face include fda pre market approval process  us  individual state and foreign nuclear requirements  california department of health services requirements  iso en certification  us department of transportation and international air transport association requirements  and european union ce mark requirements 
government regulation may impede our ability to conduct clinical trials and to manufacture the rdx system and other prospective products 
government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities 
the fda and other regulatory agencies may not approve any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  such approvals could impede our marketing of any proposed products and reduce our product revenues 
further  regulations may change  and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies  which could harm our business 
we also could be subject to new federal  state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways 
if this happens  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations 

table of contents we cannot predict the extent to which third party payors may provide reimbursement for the use of our products 
our success in marketing products based on novel or innovative technology depends in large part on whether domestic and international government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse customers for the cost of our product 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
further  many international markets have government managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
we cannot assure you that sufficient reimbursement will be available for any product that we may develop  in either the united states or internationally  to establish and maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on the development of our new products 
if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our new products  it will be very difficult for us to market our products to doctors and hospitals  and we may not achieve commercial success 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property from infringement 
a failure to protect our technology may affect our business negatively 
the market for medical devices is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
it is possible that our patents or licenses may not withstand challenges made by others or protect our rights adequately 
our success depends in large part on our ability to secure effective patent protection for our products and processes in the united states and internationally 
we have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications for various aspects of our technology 
however  we face the risks that we may fail to secure necessary patents prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances  thereby permitting competitors to market competing products  and our already granted patents may be reexamined  reissued or invalidated 
we also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties 
we cannot be certain that any of the confidentiality agreements will be honored or  if breached  that we would have enough remedies to protect our confidential information 
further  our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies 
to the extent that our consultants  key employees or others apply technological information to our projects that they develop independently or others develop  disputes may arise regarding the ownership of proprietary rights to such information and there is no guarantee that such disputes will be resolved in our favor 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  our business and commercial prospects likely will suffer 
if our current products or licensed products infringe upon the intellectual property of our competitors  the sale of these products may be challenged and we may have to defend costly and time consuming infringement claims 
we may need to engage in expensive and prolonged litigation to assert any of our rights or to determine the scope and validity of rights claimed by other parties 
with no certainty as to the outcome  litigation could be too expensive for us to pursue 
our failure to pursue litigation could result in the loss of our rights that could hurt our business substantially 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  if at all 

table of contents our failure to obtain rights to intellectual property of third parties or the potential for intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  making or using our products that use the disputed intellectual property  obtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling  making  licensing or using our products  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  redesign our products or services  and subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products or license our technology and may suffer severe financial harm 
whether or not an intellectual property claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
we may face product liability that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims 
although we never have been subject to a product liability claim  and have discontinued marketing or products following the restructuring  we cannot assure you that there will not be any claims brought against us in the future 
even then  the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the reputation and sales of our products and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products 
the price of our stock may fluctuate unpredictably in response to factors unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock market periodically experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to drop 
in particular  the market price of securities of small medical device companies  like ours  has been very unpredictable and may vary in response to announcements by us or our competitors concerning technological innovations  introductions of new products  fda and foreign regulatory actions  developments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights  public concern over the safety of radiation based therapeutic products  failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  changes in healthcare policy in the united states or other countries  and general stock market conditions 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit your ability to receive a premium price for your shares 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares without 
table of contents stockholder approval 
any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes for staggered terms of three years 
these provisions may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 
substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and make it difficult for you to recover the full value of your investment in our shares 
most of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable 
the market price of our common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares or the perception that such sales could occur 
these factors also could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
we have approximately  shares of common stock outstanding 
all of these shares are freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act 
we will issue up to an additional  shares of our common stock if we complete the merger with endologix 
we have agreed to register these shares for resale within ten business days after the completion of the merger 
although the officers and directors of endologix will be unable to sell their shares of our common stock until days after the date the shares are registered  the possibility that the remaining shares issued in the merger could be sold may cause the market price of our common stock to drop 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio included only high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper and government bonds all with remaining maturities of less than two years
