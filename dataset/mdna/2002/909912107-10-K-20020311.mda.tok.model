managemen t continues to believe that the real estate market is overvalued and accordingl y recent acquisitions have been limited to those select properties that meet th e company s stringent financial requirements 
management believes that the available working capital along with the million of availability o n the revolving credit facility discussed below  puts the company in an opportun e position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio if and when attractiv e long term opportunities become available

although it is currently uncertain which leases  if any k mart will reject or affirm as part of its reorganization  management believe s that its leases and the leases of the joint venture with k mart are at or belo w the fair market rent for comparable properties and as a result  the rejection o f one or more leases is not expected to have a material adverse effect on th e consolidated financial position of the company

the company has an interest rate swap agreement the swap to effectivel y convert its floating rate term loan to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing th e impact of interest rate changes on future expense 
under the swap  the compan y agreed to exchange with the counterparty a commercial bank the differenc e between the fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
the swap is classified a s a cash flow hedge and is recorded as a component of accounts payable and accrue d liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and othe r comprehensive income has been reduced by the same amount  with no impact o n earnings 
the differential to be paid or received on the swap is recognized ove r the term of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell commo n stock short and participate in put and or call options 
the company is highl y selective when participating in such transactions

settlements have been reached with all carriers in thi s matter 
see note  commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidate d financial statements for further discussion on this matter 
the current liabilities of the company have historically exceeded its curren t assets principally due to the financing of the purchase of long term asset s utilizing short term borrowings and from the classification of current mortgag e obligations without the corresponding current asset for such properties 
futur e financial statements may reflect current liabilities in excess of curren t assets 
management is confident that through cash flow generated fro m operations  together with borrowings available under the revolver and the sal e of select assets  all obligations will be satisfied as they come due 
previous purchases of the company s common stock have reduced the company s additional paid in capital to zero and accordingly current year purchases i n excess of par value have reduced retained earnings 
during  the compan y purchased and retired  shares of the company s common stock fo r approximately million 
future repurchases of the company s common stoc k will also reduce retained earnings by amounts in excess of the par value repurchases of the company s common stock will be made from time to time in th e open market at prevailing market prices and may be made in privately negotiate d transactions  subject to available resources 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated b y current operations and additional borrowings 
it is expected that futur e operational cash needs and the cash required to repurchase the company s commo n stock will also be satisfied from existing cash balances  equity securities ongoing operations and borrowings under the revolver 
the primary source o f capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additiona l high yield mortgage loans will come from existing funds  borrowings under th e revolver  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties an d from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection wit h specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting o f cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties i n exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company ma y also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings fro m institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equit y securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from th e potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result o f fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodit y prices 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company principally i n the hedging of overall market risks and the management of its interest rat e exposure 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserv e principal and maximize yields without significantly increasing market risk 
t o achieve this  management maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents an d investments in a variety of securities  primarily us investments in bot h common and preferred equity issues 
the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level s of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interes t earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
the company s available for sale and trading securities consist of us investments in bot h common and preferred equity issues and are subject to the fluctuations in u 
s stock markets 
most of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate and sel f amortizing from the net cash flow of the underlying properties 
the company s derivative instruments consist of short stock sales  put and or call options an d the swap 
such derivatives are subject to the fluctuations in us stoc k markets 
the company s term loan has a variable rate but is effectively hedge d by the swap  whose notional amount matches the principal balance of the variabl e rate debt it hedges 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sell s its products in those markets as well as the european  south american and asia n markets 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected b y factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economi c conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
a portion of th e company s receivables are denominated in french francs or euro dollars and ar e exposed to changes in exchange rates with the us dollar 
when the us dolla r strengthens against the french franc or euro dollar  the value of th e nonfunctional currency sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens th e functional currency amount of sales increases 
overall  the company is a ne t receiver of french francs or euro dollars and  as such  benefits from a weake r dollar but is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to the frenc h franc or euro dollar 
beginning in  all of the company s europea n receivables will be denominated in euro dollars 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commoditie s principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
while key metal s purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may impact materials pricing the company is unable to quantify the effects of such fluctuations  however  i t does enter into purchase commitments for certain key metals that generally d o not exceed twelve months which tend to minimize short term currenc y fluctuations 
the company s financial results  however  could be significantl y affected by fluctuations in metals pricing
