additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also impair the company s business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of the company s common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
company risks ihc will exercise significant influence over the company s business and affairs  which may result in potential conflicts of interest between ihc and the company the company s operations are being directed by ihc management and employees  which may result in potential conflicts of interest between ihc and the company 
for example  a conflict may arise if ihc were to engage in activities or pursue corporate opportunities that overlap with the company s business 
because ihc s management will also constitute the company s management  these individuals will have fiduciary duties to both companies  which could result in conflicts of interest  including the company foregoing opportunities or taking actions that disproportionately benefit ihc 
ihc will also have at least two representatives on the company s board of directors who will have similar conflicts of interest 
these conflicts could harm the company s business 
the occurrence of various events may adversely affect the company s ability to utilize fully its tax net operating loss carryforwards one of the potential benefits of the company s acquisition of iahc is the company s expectation that the company s us federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million may be used against any subsequent profits from iahc s business 
however  events outside of the control of the company or ihc  such as certain acquisitions and dispositions of the company s common stock  may limit the use of all or a portion of the company s tax net operating loss carryforwards 
if such events were to occur  the company s expectation of using its tax net operating loss carryforwards against potential iahc profits would not be realized and the company could potentially have a higher tax liability in the future than it would otherwise have had 
as a result of the company s acquisition of iahc  the company will operate in the insurance and reinsurance industry  an industry in which the company has not previously operated the company has not previously operated in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
as such  the company is faced with risks that are new to the company and which may adversely affect the company 
the company is relying upon the management and expertise of officers of ihc who will serve as officers of the company post closing 
the company cannot assure you of the effect this will have on the company s future operating results or stock price 
these risks include the following iahc s results may fluctuate as a result of factors generally affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry the results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general could also cause iahc s results to fluctuate 
the industry s and iahc s financial condition and results of operations may be affected significantly by fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts  rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  events like the september l  attacks  which affected the insurance and reinsurance markets generally  changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 
decrease in rates for accident and health reinsurance and insurance could reduce iahc s net income iahc primarily writes accident and health insurance and reinsurance 
rates for accident and health insurance and reinsurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of iahc s control and historically have been highly cyclical 
any significant decrease in the rates for accident and health insurance or reinsurance could reduce iahc s net income 
if the rating agencies downgrade iahc s insurance company  iahc s results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
iahc s insurance subsidiary independence american insurance company independence american is rated b very good by am best company  inc  whose ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position  and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders  and are not evaluations directed to investors 
the rating of independence american is subject to periodic review by am best company  inc  and iahc cannot assure you of the continued retention of this rating 
if am best company  inc reduces independence american s ratings from its current levels  iahc s business would be adversely affected 
iahc s loss reserves are based on an estimate of its future liability  and if actual claims prove to be greater than iahc s reserves  its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected iahc maintains loss reserves to cover iahc s estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of iahc s general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  iahc cannot assure you that current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
if iahc s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  iahc would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings  and these charges could be material 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what iahc expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on iahc s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  inflation  judicial trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance 
additionally  there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to iahc 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed 
iahc s inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce its net income iahc s success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if iahc fails to assess accurately the risks it retains  iahc may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and iahc s reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses  requiring augmentation of iahc s reserves  which in turn could reduce iahc s net income 
if iahc is unsuccessful in competing against larger or more well established competitors  iahc s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected iahc s industry is highly competitive and has experienced severe price competition from time to time over the last several years 
iahc faces competition from domestic and international insurance and reinsurance companies  underwriting agencies  and from diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than iahc 
some of these competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources than iahc  have been operating longer than iahc and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition to competition in the operation of iahc s business  iahc faces competition from a variety of sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees 
iahc cannot assure you that it will maintain its current competitive position in the markets in which it operates  or that it will be able to expand its operations into new markets and compete effectively in the future 
if iahc fails to do so  its business could be materially adversely affected 
if iahc fails to comply with extensive state and federal regulations  iahc will be subject to penalties  which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect iahc s results of operations and financial condition 
iahc is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors 
this regulation  generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which iahc does business  relates to  among other things approval of policy forms and premium rates  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  which are a measure developed by the national association of insurance commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the ability of independence american s insurance company to pay dividends to iahc  restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates  restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy  requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders  requiring certain methods of accounting  periodic examinations of independence american s operations and finances  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed  and requiring reserves for unearned premium  losses and other purposes 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 
iahc s business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and its ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for its operations 
regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant  renew  or revoke licenses and approvals 
regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including the violation of regulations 
in some instances  iahc follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations  or those that it believes to be generally followed by the industry  which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities 
if iahc does not have the requisite licenses and approvals and does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend iahc from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize it 
that type of action could have a material adverse effect on iahc s business 
also  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal  state or foreign  or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  could have a material adverse effect on iahc s business 
certain proposed federal and state legislation may  if adopted  adversely affect iahc s reinsurance of medical stop loss 
individuals who obtain health coverage through self insured plans cannot currently sue their employer in state court for punitive or compensatory damages  but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can be ordered to cover a wrongfully denied benefit 
in the continuing debate over health care reform  certain federal and state legislation has been proposed which could have the effect of making plan sponsors  administrators  or certain other parties liable for punitive damages in state court 
while iahc cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or what  if any  impact enactment of any of these would have on its reinsurance of medical stop loss  the number of employers offering health benefits or choosing self insured plans could be reduced  plans could increase the portion paid by employees thereby reducing participation  pricing and coverage options could be affected  and independence american could be faced with greater liability exposures  although this would be somewhat mitigated since independence american would not be the issuing carrier 
decreases in the fair market value of fixed income securities may greatly reduce the value of iahc s investment portfolio  and as a result  iahc s financial condition may suffer at september    of iahc s  investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities 
the fair market value of these fixed income securities and the investment income from these fixed income securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
with respect to iahc s investments in fixed income securities  the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by iahc from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
an investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates 
historically  the impact of market fluctuations has affected iahc s financial statements 
because all of iahc s fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair market value of iahc s securities are reflected in iahc s other comprehensive income 
similar treatment is not available for liabilities 
therefore  interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect iahc s stockholders equity  total comprehensive income and or cash flows 
regulatory restrictions limit iahc s ability to obtain dividends from independence american one of iahc s principal assets is the shares of capital stock of independence american 
iahc may rely on dividends from independence american to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations  dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses 
the payment of dividends by independence american is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of independence american  as well as the regulatory restrictions 
as a result  should iahc s other sources of funds prove to be inadequate  iahc may not be able to receive dividends from independence american at times and in amounts necessary to meet its obligations 
iahc is dependent on key personnel iahc s success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on its ability to retain the services of its existing key executive officers  who are also executive officers of ihc  and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any of its key executive officers or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect iahc s ability to conduct its business 
new laws and regulations addressing privacy and electronic transaction issues create uncertainty and risk for insurers in recent years  the united states congress passed the gramm leach bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act 
these acts afford protection for nonpublic personal information relating to consumers  and require certain transactions to be conducted on an electronic basis 
federal regulators have implemented several requirements of these acts 
additionally  virtually all state legislatures or regulatory bodies have adopted  or are considering the adoption of  additional laws and regulations to address privacy and electronic transaction issues 
these new laws create uncertainty and risks for insurers  which need to accurately describe their privacy practices and develop appropriate procedures to manage  protect and transmit certain types of customer data 
while iahc has implemented a process to monitor and achieve compliance with these laws  the associated costs and potential risks and liabilities are difficult or impossible to quantify 
iahc is unable to predict the precise nature and content of future laws and regulations  or the effects that they may have on the business  operations  operating results or financial condition of iahc 
potential areas of exposure facing the industry as a whole include failure to accurately or adequately describe privacy practices or to protect customer information from unauthorized disclosure 
the company s acquisition of iahc may adversely affect the company s financial condition the acquisition of iahc may have potential negative effects on the company s reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and amortization of other intangible assets 
as a result of the iahc acquisition  the company may record additional intangible assets  which may adversely affect the company s earnings and profitability for the foreseeable future 
if the amount of such recorded intangible assets is increased or if the company has future losses and is unable to demonstrate the company s ability to recover the amount of intangible assets recorded during such time periods  the intangible asset can be written down or the period of amortization could be shortened  which may further increase annual amortization charges 
in such event  the company s business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if the company is unable to successfully integrate any future acquisitions into the company s operations  then the company s results and financial condition may be adversely affected following its acquisition of iahc  the company expects to acquire other managing general underwriter businesses 
the company cannot predict if or when any prospective acquisitions will occur or the likelihood that they will be completed on favorable terms 
acquiring a business involves many risks  including diversion of resources and management time  dilution to existing stockholders if the company uses equity securities to finance acquisitions  incurrence of unforeseen obligations or liabilities  inability of management to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  difficulty assimilating the acquired operations and personnel  risks of entering markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience  and impairment of relationships with employees as a result of changes in management 
the company cannot assure you that it will make any acquisitions or that it will be able to obtain additional financing for such acquisitions  if necessary 
if any acquisitions are made  the company cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into its operations or that the acquired business will perform as expected 
the company s equity investments in other companies may not yield any returns although the company does not intend to do so in the future  the company has made equity investments in internet related companies 
in most instances  these investments are in the form of unregistered securities of private companies 
these companies typically are in an early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses 
the company s investments in these companies may not yield any returns 
furthermore  if these companies are not successful  the company could incur and has incurred charges related to the write down or write off of these investments 
for example  the company wrote down equity investments by  for the year ended september  the company also records and continues to record a share of the net losses in these companies  up to its cost basis 
the company may make additional investments in the future 
losses or charges resulting from these investments could harm the company s operating results 
the company s stock price is volatile the volatility of the company s stock price may make it difficult for holders of the common stock to transfer their shares at the prices they want 
the market price for the company s common stock has been volatile in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include announcements of developments related to the company s business  fluctuations in the company s results of operations  sales of substantial amounts of the company s securities in the marketplace  general conditions in the company s industries or the worldwide economy  an outbreak of war or hostilities  a shortfall in earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and changes in the company s relationships with the company s suppliers 
the market price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future  and these fluctuations may be unrelated to the company s performance 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  and thus  the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices 
prospective anti takeover provisions could negatively impact the company s stockholders the company is a delaware corporation 
the delaware general corporation law contains certain provisions that may discourage or delay a change in control of the company  make a change in control of the company more difficult or prevent the removal of incumbent directors 
in addition  the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that have the same or a similar effect 
these provisions may have a negative impact on the price of the company s common stock and may discourage third party bidders from making a bid for the company or may reduce any premiums paid to stockholders for their common stock 
the company has a history of losses and may face unexpected liabilities in winding down the businesses of intellicom  isp channel and aerzone the company has sustained substantial losses over the last five fiscal years 
for the year ended september   the company had a net loss of  at september   the company had an accumulated deficit of  while the company expects the process of winding down intellicom to be substantially completed by december   the company cannot assure you that it will be able to do so 
the company expects to incur significant costs related to terminating contracts  reducing the workforce and recovering and disposing of deployed assets 
while the businesses of isp channel  intellicom  and aerzone have been substantially wound down  the company also cannot assure you that all claims and issues have been resolved 
in addition  the company is currently involved in litigation  and may in the future be involved in additional litigation  with respect to the winding down of these former businesses 
the company cannot assure you of the outcome of any such litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income the company can earn on its investment portfolio  and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense the company must pay with respect to its various outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities  which are tied to market rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments or engage in hedging activities in its investment portfolio 
the company ensures the safety and preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities 
the company had short term investments of  at september  except for investments in common and preferred stock  these short term investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of between three and twenty three months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by from levels at september   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to fall by an immaterial amount 
since the company is not required to sell these investments before maturity  it has the ability to avoid realizing losses on these investments due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
on the other hand  declines in the interest rates over time will reduce its interest income 
interest rate increases  however  will increase interest expense associated with future borrowing by the company  if any 
the company does not hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
currency exchange risk the company has historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as such  has not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk
