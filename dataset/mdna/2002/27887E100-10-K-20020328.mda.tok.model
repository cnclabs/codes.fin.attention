item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ecollege is a leading provider of technology and services that enable colleges  universities  k schools  and corporations to offer an online environment for distance and on campus learning 
our technology enables our customers to reach a large number of students who wish to take online courses at convenient times and locations 
our customers can also use our technology to supplement their on campus courses with an online learning environment 
additionally  we offer services to assist in the development of online programs  including online course and campus design  development  management and hosting  as well as ongoing administration  faculty  instructor and student support  and evaluation and consulting services 
we were founded and began delivering our products and services in as of december   we have customer contracts covering approximately  individual campuses 
since our inception our customers have had approximately  student enrollments in online courses or course supplements and have purchased or ordered more than  online courses and course supplements  of which approximately  included course development services 
we have invested  and continue to invest  in our service capabilities by expanding our infrastructure 
our expenditures have exceeded our revenues since our inception and our accumulated losses have increased as a result of our growth strategy 
for the spring  summer and fall academic terms  our customers had approximately   and  student enrollments in online courses  respectively 
our customers also had approximately   and  student enrollments in our lower priced course supplements during these respective academic terms 
the number of customers for which we provide development  licensing and hosting services of their virtual campuses increased by approximately during however  the number of orders for new online courses to be developed by our professionals decreased by approximately in as we look at these important trends in our business  we expect to see continued growth in revenue in  but at a slower rate than the growth we experienced in as a result of the following factors we expect our customers student enrollments for the spring term to be significantly greater than in the fall term 
we have historically seen an increase in fall enrollments over spring  although due to issues associated with the terrorist attacks in september and other factors we did not experience that traditional growth pattern in we are uncertain if will return to our historical trend  however we do believe our customers student enrollments will grow substantially in the long term  we expect strong overall growth in our customers student enrollments in however  our pricing provides discounts to our customers as their programs grow 
therefore  while we expect our student fee revenue to show a strong increase  the increase will likely not be directly proportional to the anticipated increases in student enrollments  we expect to see our course development revenue decrease as more customers elect to self develop courses 
while we are planning to introduce new course development services  we do not expect these to have a significant impact until  and our grant from the national institute of standards and technology  or nist  concludes in april this will negatively impact our revenue  but will improve our gross margins  as we were only reimbursed for approximately of our costs of research and development under the grant 
any increases in our cost of revenue should be significantly less than our increases in revenue 
we expect to see gross margins improve as student fees increase and we utilize existing capacity in our data center 
we expect our operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future  as we utilize our current resources to support anticipated revenue growth 
revenue since inception  we have primarily generated revenue from three sources enrollment fees for students enrolled in online courses  design and development  licensing and hosting services fees for online campuses  and design and development services fees to build online courses 
our other revenue sources have primarily been professional consulting and research grant activities 
we enter into contracts with our customers to provide our online learning products and services 
our contracts typically have one to five year initial terms 
each contract specifies the type and price of the online campus purchased and the number and price of online courses purchased  as well as the fees for student enrollments and any other services purchased 
our business model is based upon a number of factors  including increasing the acceptance of online learning among colleges  universities  k schools and corporations  adding new customers  adding new schools and programs within existing customers  developing additional courses for our existing customers  increasing student enrollment in online courses  and selling new products and services to our clients 
from our inception through december   the majority of our revenue was generated by development and design services fees for building campuses and courses  and  to a lesser extent  student fees 
campus and course development revenue continued to grow in  and  however student fees have become a larger percentage of total revenue as the number of online courses offered by our customers and the number of students enrolled in those courses continue to increase at an even greater pace 
we expect this trend in our revenue mix to continue 
as our pricing and product mix change  and as our customers online programs grow and mature  we anticipate that student enrollments will increase  with resulting increases in student fee revenue 
however  due to volume discounts that we offer and competitive pricing in our industry  the increases in student fee revenue will likely not be directly proportional to the anticipated increases in student enrollments 
we continue to improve our core online products teaching solutions and campus solutions 
teaching solutions includes ecourse  an online version of a traditional classroom course delivered to students who might not otherwise have access  and ecompanion  an online teaching supplement to enhance classroom based courses 
campus solutions complements most aspects of an institution s physical presence with an online dimension  incorporating the customer s unique look and feel into our campus portals 
these online campuses allow a customer to access and manage online courses  and provide access to the online community and organizations 
we also generate a smaller portion of our total revenue from additional sources under our service solutions  content solutions and evaluation and survey products 
these additional sources include technical consulting  instructional design and faculty training and support services  ecourseevaluation  a fully hosted application that supports evaluation administration  reporting and dissemination processes in a secure environment  and ecampussurvey  for large scale institutional research surveys 
in october  we announced that our campusportal product completed a successful six month beta trial 
campusportal  the most comprehensive of our campus solutions tools  enables an institution to complement and connect most aspects of the physical campus online  including academic  administrative  social  and personal resources 
we expect this product to supplement our other campus solutions products and therefore provide an alternative for customers seeking a larger scale solution 
in late  we released a new version of our course delivery software that includes more robust self authoring tools  designed to allow customers to easily develop their own online courses without needing html or other programming knowledge 
in  we released a new version of our campus software that allows campus administrators to make certain changes to their virtual campuses without our assistance 
accordingly  we began offering new services for fees  including the complete design and development of an online course 
this service includes complete design and development of the online course by ecollege  subject to our customer s approval  and is differentiated from our standard course development services where our customers lead the course design and development efforts  and we support their efforts 
we are also offering course audit services  a comprehensive review and analysis of online courses  along with recommended modifications and improvements 
with the ease of use features and improved self authoring functionality of these products  we have seen and may continue to see customers update their own online campuses and self design and develop online courses  resulting in lower development revenue from our campus and course development services 
however  we expect our customers to continue to add additional courses  which are either self authored or developed by us  and for students to enroll in these additional courses which are hosted by us  thereby increasing our student fee revenue 
in  we began offering a new campus pricing model for access to our campus software for new customers exclusively offering distance education and for existing customers as their contracts come up for renewal 
under this program  we generally charge a one time set up and design fee to implement an online campus  an annual license fee for access to our software  and an annual hosting fee 
we also charge an annual maintenance fee to manage the online campus during the term of the agreement 
we also began offering a new pricing model for our ecompanion product under which we charge an annual license fee 
historically  we have charged a per enrollment student fee for such services 
we feel that this new pricing model will create additional market opportunities  however we do not expect a significant change in the amount of revenue we generate from this product 
generally  revenue from these fees is recognized ratably over the related period 
in october  the company was awarded a grant of approximately  by nist  a department of the us department of commerce 
the company is entitled to receive payments under the grant as research related to automated course content creation and organization  and tutoring delivery systems is performed 
maximum payments under the grant  which expired in january   are  pursuant to the terms of the nist grant  work must be performed at a prescribed format and pace 
we were granted an extension until april to complete the necessary documentation of our research 
we believe we will be able to perform under the terms of the nist grant  however  there is no assurance we will continue to receive payments under the nist grant or that we will receive the maximum payments under the nist grant 
this revenue is recognized as the work is performed by the company or its subcontractors 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized revenue of   and  respectively 
the company recorded direct expenses associated with the grant within cost of revenue of   and  for these same periods 
we do not expect that revenue from such grants will constitute a significant portion of our revenue in the future  nor will we continue to incur costs associated with the current grant after apirl we may apply for other grants in the future  although we have no present plans to do so 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy for our business 
as stated in note in the notes to financial statements  we adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on revenue recognition for public companies  effective january  as a result  the company reviewed the terms of its current contracts and determined that the provisions of sab materially impact the company s revenue recognition for our campus and course development revenue  effectively deferring the recognition of such revenue 
under sab  campus set up  design and development fees are recognized from the campus launch date through the end of the contract period or the expected life of the customer relationship  whichever is greater 
the average recognition period is slightly less than three years 
annual fees for campus licenses  hosting and maintenance services are recogniz ed on a straight line basis over months 
course development fees are recognized on a straight line basis over months from the date the course is ordered by the customer  which approximates the period over which our services are provided 
the month period may change in the future based upon changes in our experience of providing such services 
we are in the process of re evaluating this period  and expect that the recognition period may decrease in the future  resulting in revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time 
changes in our contract terms and expected contract life may also affect the period over which development fees are recognized 
student fees are recognized on a straight line basis over each course s specific academic term or over the length of the student technology license purchased by the customer  depending upon contract terms 
all other revenue sources are recognized over the length of the service period eg  annual maintenance fees or are recognized over the period of the performance of the service eg  consulting 
we accounted for the implementation of the revenue recognition guidelines of sab as a change in accounting principle effective january   and therefore have not restated the or prior years financial statements 
modifications to generally accepted accounting principles for revenue recognition could result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition policies and such changes could significantly affect the timing of recognition of future revenue and results of operations 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits for account management  online campus development  course design  technical personnel  help desk  and sales commissions 
our cost of revenue also includes personnel expense  software and hardware costs  and other direct costs associated with maintaining our data center operations  our web servers and our network infrastructure 
non marketing related costs of our grant program  as discussed below  are also included in cost of revenue 
we also allocate a portion of our occupancy and infrastructure costs to cost of revenue 
for the year  sales commissions were recorded as revenue was recognized  but were paid only after we had received an initial payment from the customer 
sales representatives also began receiving additional commissions for achieving significant goals such as signing large customers and increasing program offerings within current customers 
historically  we have recorded and paid sales commissions as contracts were signed and as revenue was recognized 
on april  we started to capitalize software development costs related to our campusportal product as required by aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
as of march   we had capitalized  of costs related to development of this product 
in april the campusportal software was determined to be ready for its intended use and we began amortizing the total cost over its expected useful life of three years 
accordingly   of amortization expense has been recorded as of december  and is included in cost of revenue 
realization of the capitalized software development costs is dependent upon generating revenue from the related software products and services during the useful life of such capitalized software 
it is reasonably possible that a review of the recorded amount of capitalized software development costs in the future could indicate that they are impaired  and the amount of impairment could be significant 
additionally  the technology we use to support our customers can be subject to significant changes as new technology and software products are introduced into the marketplace by others 
because of the volatility of the technological environment  it is reasonably possible that a change in our technology strategy could result in a conclusion that all or a portion of the recorded balance is impaired 
we expect that our cost of revenue will continue to decline in the future as a percent of revenue 
we anticipate experiencing this decline as we achieve operating efficiencies  since many of these costs do not increase in direct proportion to our revenue  and as our revenue mix changes to be more heavily weighted towards student and license fees which have a lower cost than revenue derived from our other service offerings 
grant program we implemented a grant program in late designed to assist new and existing customers by increasing the quality and number of online courses they offer and the number of students pursuing online degrees 
seventy two grants were awarded  at our discretion  to institutions based on demonstrated commitment to a quality online degree program  the number of current and potential students  the college or university s unique approach to online learning and other factors 
we do not anticipate offering new grant awards 
funds granted consist of both marketing funds and educational support funds 
marketing funds are reimbursed to customers based on demonstration of payment for approved marketing activities 
these expenses are recorded as marketing expenses when it is estimated they are incurred by our customers to third parties 
educational support funds consist of faculty stipends and technology and travel funds  and are considered contract costs 
to date  we have granted approximately million  which consists of million in marketing funds and million in educational support funds 
pursuant to the terms of the grants  funds are paid to the grant recipients after they have provided evidence of payment for appropriate expenditures 
customer expenditures for our services are not considered reimbursable under terms of the grants 
reimbursements for marketing expenditures totaled  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  disbursements under the grant program of  and  were made primarily for faculty stipends to encourage the generation of digital course content and hardware technology purchases 
the estimated remaining disbursements under the grant program for reimbursed marketing and educational support funds are  and million  respectively  at december  and are expected to be paid during if contract costs  including appropriate educational support funds  are in excess of the revenue guaranteed under the related agreement  such excess is expensed in the quarter in which the excess is first identified 
for the year ending december   the company recognized such a loss of  as we recognize course development revenue under these contracts  the grant loss accrual is reduced such that the gross margin related to this revenue is zero 
this reduction is reflected in cost of revenue and was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remaining estimated grant loss accrual at december  is  and is included in grant liabilities on the balance sheet 
the determination of the grant loss requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the total amount of costs to be incurred 
these estimates and assumptions may change and affect the reported amounts of the contingent liability on the date o f the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
as contracts are completed  actual results could impact reported amount of expense in the current reporting period 
we recorded   and  of expenses related to educational support  before any reduction of the grant loss accrual  in  and  respectively 
gross margin as our product mix continues to change and diversify  we expect that the mix of our cost of revenue will change accordingly 
our investments in our infrastructure and personnel should be able to support future growth and with increased utilization  we have been able to achieve cost of revenue that is lower than our revenue 
since we expect our revenue to increase in the future while our cost of revenue decreases due to operating efficiencies and the expiration of grant program expense  we expect continued improvement in our gross margin 
product development product development includes costs of maintaining  developing and improving our software products 
these costs consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  consulting fees  occupancy and depreciation expenses 
we expect our development costs to remain at approximately the same level as in as we continue to develop new products to respond to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
selling and marketing the principal components of our selling and marketing expenses are employee compensation and benefits  advertising  industry conferences  and travel 
other significant components include marketing collaterals and direct mailings  consulting fees  occupancy and depreciation expenses 
our grant program includes reimbursement of approved third party expenditures to our customers for marketing their online degree programs 
these funds are recorded as marketing expense as we estimate that our customers incur them and we incur the obligation to reimburse them 
we recorded  and  of marketing expenses associated with the grant program in and  respectively 
we expect a slight decrease in total selling and marketing expenses in as we implement more focused and cost effective selling techniques 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include accounting and finance  legal services  business development  corporate facilities  executive  and internal technical network administration and support 
employee compensation and benefits represent the most significant component of general and administrative expense 
other components include rent  depreciation  communications  professional and consulting fees  and stock based compensation 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will not change significantly in absolute dollars in the year results of continuing operations we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we believe that our revenue growth will continue in the year primarily based upon growth in student fees 
at the same time we intend to continue to make investments in technology which may involve the development  acquisition or licensing of technologies that complement or augment our existing services and technologies 
our selling and marketing expense should decrease slightly as a result of our focused strategy in we also intend to utilize our existing administrative resources and operating efficiencies to continue to support our business at slightly lower costs 
our operating loss decreased significantly during and we expect this trend to continue 
we expect our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization of capitalized software costs and stock based compensation to be slightly positive for the year and plan to realize operating profits in  although there can be no guarantee thereof 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
student enrollments in ecourses increased to approximately  from approximately  in the prior year 
student enrollments in our lower priced ecompanion course supplements increased to approximately  from approximately  in the prior year 
student fees represented  and  of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
campus and course development fees represented  and  of total revenue for the year ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized revenue from developing  licensing and hosting virtual campuses forof different customers during  up from the customers that had virtual campuses in there were  new ecourses developed on our platform in  of which were developed by our professionals 
this compares to  and  respectively in with the ease of use features and improved self authoring functionality of our products  we have seen and may continue to see customers update their own online campuses and self design and develop online courses  resulting in lower development revenue from our campus and course development services 
other revenue includes professional consulting revenue of  and  and revenue from the nist grant of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  our cost of revenue increased primarily due to the amortization of  of software development costs related to our campusportal product previously capitalized and additional depreciation and occupancy costs related to cost of revenue of  we also had an increase in information technology expenses associated with hosting our customers programs 
the amount of expenses related to our grant program included in cost of revenue also increased by  to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in personnel costs  as we were able to support our revenue growth through increased operating efficiencies 
our operations and account management personnel decreased to an average of in from during  with most of the reductions coming in march total cost of revenue was approximately and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin 
we experienced a positive gross margin of  or of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to a negative gross margin of  for the year ended december  the favorable increase of  in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in our student fees resulting from our increased student enrollments  which have a higher contribution margin than our other revenue sources  as well as improved utilization of our professional services staff and realization of operating leverage on our fixed expenses as our revenue increased 
product development 
during the year ended december   we expanded and improved our teaching solutions product line  including the release of the next generation of our elearning platform  ecollege au 
the new platform provides enhanced features with increased customization capabilities  usability and accessibility for our customers 
additionally  due to the significant investments we made in to improve our efficiency in developing online campuses and courses  we were able to reduce our overall product development costs in product development expenses decreased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to our decreased use of external consulting for product development during staffing levels of our product development personnel remained consistent with the prior year  averaging in and in we also capitalized  of internal use sof tware development costs related to our campusportal product during the year ended december   compared to the  capitalized during the year ended december  therefore  we had a total of  and  in product development expenditures during and  respectively 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in advertising and marketing personnel salaries and benefits expense  as we averaged and marketing related employees during and  respectively 
marketing costs associated with our grant program were  less than in the same period last year 
external advertising expenses also decreased  during the year ended december   as we focused our marketing strategy on more efficient methods 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses also reflects decreases in amounts spent on marketing collaterals  trade show participation and other promotional activities 
our sales personnel decreased slightly to an average of employees in from in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was due in large part to a decrease in amortization of deferred compensation due to employee terminations  as well as decreases in executive compensation and severance  consulting services and other cost savings due to improved efficiencies in our administrative departments 
our executive and administrative personnel decreased to an average of in from during  including the termination of our president and chief operating officer 
through december   we recorded aggregate deferred compensation totaling  in connection with the grant of stock options and restricted common stock to employees  officers  directors and former executives 
the deferred charge is being amortized over the vesting period of such options or restricted stock  which ranges from to years 
of the total deferred compensation   was amortized in the year ended december   while  was amortized in the year ended december  the majority of compensation expense related to such options is included in general and administrative expense 
however  a portion of such compensation expense has been allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense and product development expense as appropriate 
we expect the majority of the remaining  of deferred compensation recorded as of december  to be amortized during other general and administrative expense 
additional non cash general and administrative expenses of  reflect the fair market value of fully vested options issued during the third quarter of to a non employee investment partnership in exchange for the services of our chief executive officer in lieu of salary  benefits and other compensation 
this expense was not incurred during the year ended december  other income expense 
interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash invested as a result of the use of such cash in our operations 
interest expense decreased slightly during compared to other expense of  is primarily due to the net realized losses on sales of our short term investments during the year ended december  as a result of a change in our investment policy during the third quarter of to limit risk exposure  all of our invested cash is in money market accounts as of december   therefore we do not anticipate incurring such losses in the future 
net loss 
our net loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased to  or per share  from  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december  effective january   the company recorded a  one time cumulative adjustment in connection with the adoption of sab therefore  our net loss decreased to  or per share  from  or per share  for the years ended december   as compared with the year ended december  years ended december  and revenue 
as previously discussed  in response to the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
issued in december  we have changed our revenue recognition of campus and course development fees 
as a result  total revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  in  or 
if this accounting change had not been implemented january   the revenue for the year ended december  would have been  under the percent complete method  which is the same method used to recognize revenue in therefore  on a comparable basis  revenue would have increased  or versus increases in revenue are due to increased student enrollment in online courses  as well as an increased number of online campuses and courses developed 
student fees represented  and  of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
campus and course development fees and other revenue represented  and  of total revenue  respectively  for these same periods 
if the accounting change had not been implemented january   the campus and course development and other revenue for would have been  under the percent complete method 
revenue from the nist grant was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively and is included in other revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  in  or 
as previously discussed  we have changed our revenue recognition of campus and course development fees in accordance with sab as a result  the amount of expenses related to our grant program included in cost of revenue decreased by  if the change in accounting principle had not been implemented as of january   the total cost of revenue for the year ended december  would have been  under the percent complete method 
therefore  on a comparable basis  cost of revenue would have increased  or over cost of revenue increased primarily due to additional personnel costs to support revenue growth 
our operations and account management personnel increased from an average of in to during costs associated with expanding and improving our web servers  database architecture  and network infrastructure increased by  over depreciation and occupancy costs related to cost of revenue increased by  these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in the amount of grant expense and a  decrease in sales commissions 
total cost of revenue was approximately and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin 
we experienced a negative gross margin of  for the year ended december  as compared to a negative gross margin of  in for a improvement 
our gross margin would have been a positive  or of total revenue  had the accounting change for sab not been implemented january  excluding the expense of our grant program  we would have recognized a positive gross margin of  for the year ended december  compared to a negative gross margin of  for the year ended december  our gross margin for would have been a positive  excluding the grant program and had the accounting change for sab not been implemented january  the improvement in gross margin this year was primarily due to the increase in our student fees  which have a higher contribution margin  improved utilization of our professional services staff and realizing operating leverage on our fixed expenses as our revenues increase 
product development 
for the year ended december   we made substantial investments in expanding and improving our teaching solutions product 
we also incurred significant expenses in developing tools to improve our efficiency in developing online campuses and courses 
accordingly  product development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the number of product development personnel increased to at december  from at december  we also incurred an increase of  in occupancy and depreciation charges allocated to development activities 
on april   we started to capitalize software development costs related to our campusportal product 
as of december   we have capitalized  in development costs  which will be amortized through cost of revenue as we begin to recognize revenue associated with this new product 
therefore  we had a total of  in product development expenditures during selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing costs associated with the grant program of  for from in the increase in selling and marketing expenses also reflects increases in the number of selling and marketing personnel  additional trade show participation and other promotional activities  and increases in travel expense 
our selling and marketing personnel increased from an average of in to in we also incurred additional marketing activity costs of  in associated with enhancing our corporate website  as well as an increase of  in occupancy and depreciation charges allocated to selling and marketing activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  expenses increased in the form of additional salaries  consulting  professional fees  and travel expenses as we built and developed our management team and operating infrastructure 
we also incurred an increase of  in occupancy and depreciation charges allocated to general and administrative activities 
additional general and administrative expenses for include severance pay of approximately  for the former chief executive officer 
in addition  outside consulting  professional fees  recruiting fees and travel expenses increased  reflecting our expanded business activities 
the number of general and administrative personnel as of december  was  consisting of employees in the corporate services area which includes finance  human resources  legal  facilities and travel  employees in systems administration  and employees in executive and business development 
the number of employees at december  was through december   we recorded aggregate deferred compensation totaling  in connection with the grant of options to employees 
the deferred charge is being amortized over the vesting period of such options  which ranges from to years 
of the total deferred compensation   was amortized in the year ended december  and  was amortized during the year ended december  the majority of compensation expense related to such options is included in general and administrative expense 
however  a portion of such compensation expense has been allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense and product development expense as appropriate 
other general and administrative expense 
additional non cash general and administrative expenses of  reflect the fair market value of options issued during the third quarter of to a non employee investment partnership in exchange for the services of our chief executive officer in lieu of salary  benefits and other compensation 
other income expense 
interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  increased to  in from  in this increase is primarily due to an increase in cash as a result of proceeds from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of and the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in the first quarter of of  and  respectively 
interest expense associated with our capital lease facility and interest resulting from amortization of warrants and prepaid fees associated with establishing the line of credit in was  in compared to  in net loss 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  and a total net loss after the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  as compared to a net loss of  in effective january   the company recorded a  one time cumulative adjustment in response to sab if this accounting change had not been implemented january   the net loss for the year ended december  would have been  or per share 
our net loss applicable to common stockholders increased to  or per share  from  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss applicable to common stockholders in includes the impact of dividends and accretion related to our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
income taxes income taxes consist of federal  state and local taxes 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in net tax loss carryforwards 
and while we believe that our revenue growth will continue in the year  we do not expect to realize net taxable income in the foreseeable future  and therefore we expect to generate additional net operating loss carryforwards 
however  utilization of such prospective net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations 
significant changes in ownership such as our public offering in may also limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
in addition  income taxes may be payable during this time due to operating income in certain tax jurisdictions which cannot be offset by operating loss carryforwards 
if we achieve net taxable income and the net operating loss carryforwards are not available  because they have been exhausted or have expired  we may experience significant tax expense 
we have rec orded no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes because we incurred net operating losses from inception through december  as of december   we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in varying amounts beginning in we have established a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our deferred tax asset because our management has not been able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the deferred tax asset  due primarily to our history of operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased  to  at december  from  at december  the increase from december  was primarily due to cash proceeds from sales of marketable securities of  and cash provided by financing activities of  including net borrowings under our line of credit of  in  partially offset by cash used in operating activities of  and purchases of marketable securities of  overall  our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities decreased  to  at december  from  at december we have financed the majority of our operations through the issuance of equity securities 
we have sold common stock and preferred stock generating aggregate proceeds of  from inception through december   including our initial public offering 
in january  we received net proceeds of  from the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the amount received was net of the underwriting offering expenses 
in may  we received  from the exercise of warrants for common stock 
we leased  of equipment under a  sale leaseback agreement entered into in the second quarter of at the end of the initial month lease term  we are required to purchase the equipment for of the amount drawn 
as of december   we have leased  of equipment under a  sale leaseback agreement entered into in the second quarter of  and therefore have  available under the new agreement 
at the end of the initial month lease term  we are required to purchase the equipment for of the amount drawn 
these leases are treated as capital leases for accounting purposes 
as of december  and  the company leased  and  of equipment  respectively 
accumulated depreciation on leased equipment was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
our total capital lease obligations  including interest  as of december  and were  and  respec tively 
we have a  revolving line of credit with a maturity date of march  which we expect to renew through march the line of credit is secured by all of our assets 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is an adjustable rate of prime  which was as of december   plus 
in december  the company drew  from the revolving line which remained outstanding at december  the entire  draw was subsequently repaid in january in december  the company drew  from the revolving line which remained outstanding at december  the entire  draw was subsequently repaid in january the lease agreements and line of credit contain certain financial covenants 
we were out of compliance with the quick ratio covenant as of june  however  we received a written waiver of the covenant as of june  and the covenant was subsequently amended during the third quarter of this year to exclude deferred revenue in the calculations 
we were out of compliance with the maximum loss covenant as of december  we received a written waiver of the covenant in march in connection with the bank line of credit  we issued warrants to the lender for  shares of common stock 
the exercise price of the warrants is  the offering price of common shares sold in connection with our initial public offering on december  the value of the warrants at the date of issuance was  which was recorded as a deferred financing cost and was amortized to interest expense over the original term of the revolving line of credit 
we used the net proceeds from our equity financings for funding capital expenditures and supporting sales  marketing  product development activities  expanding our data center  investing in short term marketable securities with maturities of one year or less  enhancing new accounting and financial information systems and for other expenses associated with our growth 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and working capital together with cash generated from operations  are sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
because we expect to incur net losses during  our cash and cash equivalents will decrease as necessary to fund such losses 
although at this time our plans do not require us to raise additional capital  in the future  we may desire to raise additional capital 
in the event that we need to raise additional capital  we cannot assure that additional funds will be available or that funds will be available on terms favorable to ecollege 
our need to raise additional funds could also directly and adversely affect our stockholders investment in our common stock 
when a company raises funds by issuing shares of stock  the percentage ownership of the existing stockholders of that company is reduced  or diluted 
if we raise funds in the future by issuing additional shares of stock  stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares 
stockholders may also experience dilution in the value of their shares if we issue additional shares of stock and receive funds from the exercise of outstanding stock options 
risk factors we have a history of net operating losses  and we anticipate future losses we have experienced aggregate net losses from operations of  since our inception in july these losses consist of  for the period from inception to december   and     and  for the years ended december     and  respectively 
we may never achieve profitability  and if we do  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
in we invested heavily to develop our services and establish our development  sales and marketing capabilities  in the belief that our success depends  among other things  on our ability to develop new relationships with colleges  universities and other potential clients and maintain existing customer relationships 
although we continue to hold this belief  we reduced our sales staff and marketing expenditures in march to achieve cost savings and greater operating efficiency 
if we are unable to continue to increase our revenues with this reduced sales staff and marketing budget  our business and financial results will be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may be below the expectations of analysts and investors because of the emerging nature of the online learning market  we may be unable to accurately forecast our revenues 
the sales cycle for our products and services varies widely and it is difficult for us to predict the timing of particular sales  the rate at which online campuses  courses and or course supplements will be implemented or the number of students who will enroll in the online courses 
the cancellation or delay of even a small number of campus and or course implementations could cause our revenues to fall short of projections 
since most of our costs are fixed and are based on anticipated revenue levels  small variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that such comparisons may not be accurate indicators of future performance 
since we may be unable to adjus t spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant decrease in revenue would likely have an immediate material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
due to the change in our method of recognizing revenue from campus and course development fees as of january   these fluctuations in our revenues have diminished  but still occur due to the significance of our student fee revenue 
in addition  if our future operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
we operate in a highly competitive market and we may not have adequate resources to compete successfully the online learning market is quickly evolving and is subject to rapid technological change 
although the market is highly fragmented with no single competitor accounting for a dominant market share  competition is intense 
competition is most intense from colleges and universities internal information technology departments 
some colleges and universities construct online learning systems utilizing in house personnel and creating their own software or purchasing software components from a vendor 
we also face significant competition from a variety of companies including other companies which seek to offer a complete solution including software and services  software companies with specific products for the college and university market  systems integrators  and hardware vendors 
other competitors in this market include a wide range of education and training providers 
these companies use video  cable  correspondence  cd rom  computer based training  and online training 
we believe that the level of competition will continue to intensify as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do and may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and well financed companies 
certain competitors may be able to secure alliances with customers and affiliates on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to systems development than we can 
in addition  new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressures we face 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  as well as loss of market share and brand recognition 
we may not b e able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and competitive pressures we face could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we depend on our key personnel our success depends on the performance of senior management and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified technical professionals 
the loss of the services of a number of senior management personnel or highly qualified technical professionals could have a material adverse effect on us 
competition for highly skilled employees is intense in our line of business  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining these personnel 
we continue to refine our business model  cannot predict whether the ongoing changes will be accepted  and may continue to make changes over the past few years we have implemented several changes in our business model to increase revenues  and we continue to develop new pricing structures to meet the needs of our customers 
we cannot predict whether ongoing refinements we make to our business model will be accepted by our existing customer base or by prospective customers 
under our current model  customers pay a one time set up fee at the time they enter into a contract with us and a license fee  hosting fee and maintenance fee on an annual basis over the length of their contract 
we cannot predict whether our current pricing model will continue to be accepted by our existing customers or whether prospective customers will be deterred from contracting with us in part because of these terms 
we therefore cannot predict whether these terms will achieve or maintain revenue growth in the future 
moreover  we may continue to make changes to our business model to attempt to achieve greater efficiency or to respond to ch anges in our evolving industry 
we cannot predict whether these future changes will impact our business negatively 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated from a relatively small number of clients revenue from a small number of customers has comprised a substantial portion of our revenue and is expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
in  our top customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in  our top customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in work performed for these principal clients  or failure to collect accounts receivable from these principal clients  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our sales cycle is lengthy and can vary widely the sales cycle between initial customer contact and signing of a contract varies widely  reflecting differences in our customers decision making processes and budget cycles 
as a result  we may not be able to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales and resulting revenue 
our customers typically conduct extensive and lengthy evaluations before committing to our system 
delays in the sales cycle can result from  among other things  changes in a customer s budget  the need for approval from both the customer s administration and faculty  and the need to educate customers as to the potential applications of and cost savings associated with our services 
we generally have little or no control over these factors  which may cause a potential customer to favor a competitor s products and services  or to delay or forego purchases altogether 
the delay in or failure to complete planned transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and coul d cause our financial results to vary significantly from period to period 
we depend on third parties to market certain of our products a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from enrollment fees for each enrollment in an online course that we implement 
generally  we do not market the ecollege brand directly to students and therefore have little influence on the number of students that enroll 
we are therefore dependent on the institutions and organizations that purchase our products and services to market to individual students 
the failure of these third parties to effectively attract  maintain  and increase student enrollments could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
the undeveloped and rapidly changing market for our products and services makes it difficult to predict future growth the market for our products and services is rapidly evolving in response to ongoing developments relating to online technology 
the market is characterized by evolving industry standards and customer demands  and an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed online products and services 
it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate  if any  of this market 
as is typical in the case of a rapidly evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to continue to improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  and we cannot assure that we will be successful in developing  integrating or marketing such products or services 
in addition  our new product releases may contain undetected errors that require significant design modifications  resulting in a loss of customer confidence and adversely affecting our business 
our network infrastructure and computer systems may fail the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our network infrastructure and computer systems is critical to our success 
any system failure that causes interruptions in our ability to provide services could reduce customer satisfaction and  if sustained or repeated  would reduce the attractiveness of our technology and services to our customers and their students 
an increase in the number of students online through our servers could strain the capacity of our software or hardware  which could lead to slower response times or system failures 
we periodically test our user capacity by simulating load capacity based on our student enrollment 
to the extent we do not successfully address any capacity constraints  such constraints would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer systems against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failures  vandalism and other malicious acts  and similar unexpected adverse events  including the consequences of terrorist attacks 
in addition  the failure of our telecommunications provider or our network backbone provider  which provides us with our internet connection  to provide the data communications capacity and network infrastructure in the time frame we require could cause service interruptions or slower response times 
despite precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions or delays in the delivery of our products and services 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our network may be vulnerable to security risks our success depends on our ability to provide superior network security protection and the confidence of our customers in that ability 
our system is designed to prevent unauthorized access from the internet and  to date  our operations have not been affected by security breaks  nevertheless  in the future we may not be able to prevent unauthorized disruptions of our network operations  whether caused unintentionally or by computer hackers 
due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on the websites hosted by us  such as students grades  our websites may be targeted by hackers 
as such  disruptions may result in liability to us and harm to our customers  and our failure to prevent such disruptions would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we must protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technology  such as our trade and product names  and the software included in our products 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect these rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to duplicate or copy aspects of our services or software or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the software underlying our services is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists  software piracy in general will likely be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
as a consequence  effective trademark  service mark  copyright  and trade secret protection m ay not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available 
our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we may from time to time encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
these disputes could lead to litigation  which may be time consuming and costly even if successful  cause product release delays  require us to redesign our products or services  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
although we believe that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to market our existing services without incurring liability to third parties  we might not prevail in such disputes 
failure to prevail in one or more such disputes could impair our right to market our services  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
online learning may not be broadly accepted by academics and educators through our relationships with educational institutions and educators we understand that some academics and educators are opposed to online learning in principle 
they also have expressed concerns regarding the perceived loss of control over the education process that can result from the outsourcing of online campuses and courses 
some of these critics  particularly college and university professors  have the capacity to influence the market for our services  and their opposition could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
the market for online learning in higher education is in an early stage and may not continue to develop the market for online learning is relatively new and emerging 
our success depends upon colleges  universities and other educational organizations adopting online learning 
although we have entered into contracts with some colleges and universities  these colleges and universities may not continue to use the online learning products and services we provide 
further  given their relatively early entry into the market for online learning  the colleges and universities with which we have contracts are likely to be less risk averse than most colleges and universities 
accordingly  the rate at which we have been able to enter into contracts with colleges and universities in the past may not be indicative of the rate at which we will be able to enter into contracts in the future 
any failure of online learning to gain continuing market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our stock price is likely to be volatile the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  changes in market valuations of other online service companies  future sales of our common stock  stock market price and volume fluctuations  and other risk factors described in this form k 
moreover  our stock is thinly traded  and we have a relatively small public float 
domestic and international stock markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions  such as a recession or terrorist attacks or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market prices for stocks of many internet related and technology companies have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations that appeared to bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
these market prices are subject to wide variations 
we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms although at this time our plans do not require us to raise additional capital  we may seek to raise additional capital in the future 
the circumstances that could cause us to consider raising additional capital include acquisitions 
in the event that we need to raise additional capital  we cannot assure that additional funds will be available or that funds will be available on terms favorable to us 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial position 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our need to raise additional funds could also directly and adversely affect our stockholders investment in our common stock 
when a company raises funds by issuing shares of stock  the percentage ownership of the existing stockholders of that company is reduced  or diluted 
if we raise funds in the future by issuin g additional shares of stock  stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares 
any acquisitions or investments we make could be disruptive to our business  have adverse accounting consequences or be dilutive to our investors although we have no present agreement or understanding relating to any material acquisition or investment  from time to time we have had discussions with companies regarding our acquiring  or investing in  their businesses 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating its operations  or assimilating and retaining its key personnel 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and employees 
also  acquisitions may result in a variety of accounting charges which would increase our reported expenses  including impairment of goodwill and the write off of acquired in process research and development 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue dilutive equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions or investments 
as a result  any future business acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
government regulation may adversely affect our future operating results we are increasing our presence in many states across the country 
due to this increased presence  we may be subject to additional tax laws and government regulations which may adversely affect our future operating results 
our violation of any state statutes  laws or other regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition  it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  relating to user privacy  content  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or expansion of the internet  and may cause us to incur unanticipated compliance costs 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business 
we are subject to risk from general economic conditions our revenues are subject to fluctuation as a result of general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services to colleges and universities 
should current weak economic conditions continue or worsen  these organizations may not increase or may reduce their expenditures  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
general economic conditions may impact the value and realizability of our investment securities factors influencing the financial condition of security issuers may impact their ability meet their financial obligations and could impact the realizability of our security portfolio 
our short term investment portfolio is managed on a discretionary basis by a third party  subject to our investment policy 
the company s current investment policy requires that its investment portfolio be limited to investment securities of less than one year in maturity 
as of december  all of our invested cash is in money market accounts  however  in the event our investment policy changes  we could invest cash in securities which are less liquid and subject to more market risk 
our plans to expand our international presence may not be successful a component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence in select foreign markets 
it may be costly to establish international operations  promote our brand internationally  and develop localized products and support 
revenue from international activities may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign operations 
in addition  we may not be successful in marketing and distributing our products due to our limited experience in these markets 
our business and future operating results are subject to a broad range of uncertainties arising out of the terrorist attacks on the united states our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the terrorist attacks on the united states of america in september these uncertainties include the potential worsening or extension of the current global economic slowdown and the economic consequences of military action or additional terrorist activities 
while the recent terrorist attacks have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  any future attacks or events arising as a result of the attacks  such as interruptions to the international telecommunications network or the internet  could have a material impact on our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

in accordance with an amendment subsequently issued in  the company was required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  to date  we have not entered into any arrangements that would fall under the scope of sfas no 
 and therefore the adoption of sfas no 
has not had an impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june   and for all business combinations accounted for under the purchase method initiated before but completed after june  in addition  in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and applies to all goodwill and other intangibles recognized in the financial statements at that date 
the adoption of these standards is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  any business combinations initiated from this point forward will be impacted by these two standards 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement applies to recognized long lived assets of an entity to be held and used or to be disposed of 
this statement does not apply to goodwill  intangible assets not being amortized  financial instruments  and deferred tax assets 
this statement requires an impairment loss to be recorded for assets to be held and used when the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
an asset that is classified as held for sale shall be recorded at the lower of it s carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we are is required to adopt this statement for the first quarter of we do not believe that this statement will materially impact our results of operations 
in april and july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on two issues within issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf was subsequently codified along with other related eitf issues into eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor or a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
among other issues  eitf addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendor s products is a an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be included as a cost or an expense when recognized in the vendor s income statement 
under our grant program described in the notes to our financial statements  we have historically accounted for our grant payments to institutions as costs of revenue or operating expenses in our income statement 
we are currently evaluating eitf and are in the process of determining the impact eitf will have on our income statement classifications  if any 
if it is determined that eitf does impact the company s financial statements  we are required to adopt eitf for financial statements presented for periods beginning after december   and financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes would be reclassified to comply with the income statement classification requirements of eitf seasonality due to seasonality inherent in the academic calendar  which typically consists of three academic terms  as well as our customers plans for online campus and course development  we experience fluctuations in our sequential quarterly results 
we typically have lower revenue in the summer academic term which spans the second and third calendar quarters 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature and seasonal fluctuations in revenue will result in seasonal fluctuation in our operating results 
as a result  sequential quarter to quarter financial results are not directly comparable 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that our revenue and other operating results should not be relied upon as indications of future performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
the company is  or may become  exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was  at december  historically we have invested available cash in money market accounts  certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that generally had maturities of three months or less  as well as debt securities of united states government agencies and corporate bonds 
our short term investment portfolio is managed on a discretionary basis by a third party  subject to our investment policy 
the company s investment policy requires that its investment portfolio be limited to investment securities of less than one year in maturity 
furthermore  as a result of a change in the company s investment strategy during the third quarter of to limit risk exposure  all of our invested cash is in money market accounts as of december  as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low 
however  factors influencing the financial condition of security issuers may impact their ability meet their financial obligations and could impact the realizability of our security portfolio 
we have not undertaken any other interest rate market risk management activities 
included in the results of operations for the year ending december  are net realized losses of  these losses are primarily due to the  loss sustained upon the sale of our investment in a commercial bond issued by southern california edison 
due to certain circumstances related to the state of california s regulatory environment  the fair value of our investment in the southern california edison bond had declined from its original purchased cost of  and we believed that the future value of these bonds would continue to be uncertain 
therefore  the company elected to sell these bonds in september to reduce the risk in our investment portfolio 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s debt instruments or our cash equivalents nor would it materially impact the earnings or cash flow associated with our cash investments 
see note to the financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
although our revolving line of credit bears interest at an adjustable rate of prime plus  a hypothetical ten percent change in the market rates as of december  would not have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows in  as the entire borrowings outstanding at december  were repaid on january  we anticipate drawing on our line of credit only for short term working capital needs during
