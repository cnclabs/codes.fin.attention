item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the actual results achieved by temple inland may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include general economic  market  or business conditions  the opportunities or lack thereof that may be presented to and pursued by temple inland and its subsidiaries  the availability and price of raw materials used by temple inland and its subsidiaries  competitive actions by other companies  changes in laws or regulations  and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of temple inland and its subsidiaries 
results of operations for the years ended december  and summary consolidated revenues were billion in  billion in and billion in income from continuing operations was million in  million in  and million in income from continuing operations per diluted share was in  in  and in business segments temple inland manages its operations through three business segments paper  building products and financial services 
each of these business segments is affected by the factors of supply and demand and changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
these conditions include changes in interest rates  new housing starts  home repair and remodeling activities  and the strength of the us dollar  some or all of which may have varying degrees of impact on the business segments 
as used herein the term parent company refers to temple inland and its manufacturing business segments  paper and building products with the financial services group reported on the equity method 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  temple inland follows generally accepted accounting policies  which in many cases require temple inland to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
many of these policies are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few policies that are critical because they are important in determining the financial condition and results and they are difficult to apply 
within the parent company  they include asset impairments and pension accounting and within the financial services group  they include the allowance for loan losses and mortgage servicing rights 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that have to be made currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations as well as management intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning that actual results can and probably will be different from those currently estimated 
temple inland bases its assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other reasonable factors 
measuring assets for impairments requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in management intentions  market conditions or operating performance could indicate that impairment charges might be necessary 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  consideration is given to both historical returns and future returns over the next quarter century 
differences between actual and expected returns will adjust future pension expense 
allowances for loan losses are based on loan classifications  historical experiences and evaluations of future cash flows and collateral values and are subject to regulatory scrutiny 
changes in general economic conditions or loan specific circumstances will inevitably change those evaluations 
measuring for impairment and amortizing mortgage servicing rights is largely dependent upon the speed at which loans are repaid and market rates of return 
changes in interest rates will affect both of these variables and could indicate that impairments or adjustments of the rate of amortization might be necessary 
the paper group the paper group manufactures linerboard and corrugating medium that it converts into a complete line of corrugated and specialty packaging 
the paper group operations consist of linerboard mills  corrugating medium mill  converting plants  specialty converting plants and an interest in a gypsum facing paper joint venture 
the paper group s facilities are located throughout the united states and in mexico and puerto rico 
during  the paper group completed the acquisition of the corrugated packaging operations of chesapeake corporation  elgin corrugated box company and compro packaging llc 
these operations consist of corrugated converting plants in eight states 
these acquired operations did not contribute significantly to the paper group s operating income 
during january  the parent company initiated a tender offer to acquire gaylord container corporation 
the transaction is contingent on several matters including the tender of at least two thirds of the outstanding shares and at least percent in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes and percent of the senior subordinated notes 
the tender is scheduled to expire on february   and will be funded from a bank financing commitment 
the paper group s revenues come principally from the sales of corrugated packaging products and to a lesser degree from the sales of linerboard in the domestic and export markets 
the paper group s revenues were billion in  billion in and billion in while revenues were flat in and up percent in  the mix of revenues is changing 
corrugated packaging revenues represent percent of total revenues in and percent in and in  the corrugated packaging revenues derived from the acquired corrugated packaging operations  approximately million  were offset by declines in domestic shipments due to the weakening economy 
average box prices were up percent  and box shipments were unchanged 
excluding the acquired corrugated packaging operations  average box prices would have been up percent  and shipments would have been down percent 
revenues and volumes were also affected by the poor performance of the specialty packaging operations 
until the economy improves  box shipments will likely remain weak  and box prices will likely trend downward 
the changes in revenues in and were due to increases in average box prices  up percent in and percent in with essentially no change in volumes 
the decrease in linerboard revenues in was due to lower prices  down percent  and lower shipments  down percent 
the weakening economy softened the market for domestic linerboard while increased offshore capacity and a strong us dollar continued to affect export markets 
until the economy improves  the downward trend in the domestic linerboard market will probably continue 
it is likely that the downward trend in export demand will continue during due to significant new offshore capacity 
the changes in revenues in and were due to increases in average prices  up percent in and percent in  with volumes down percent in and up percent in costs  which include production  distribution and administrative costs  were billion in  billion in and billion in the change in costs in was due to the acquired corrugated packaging operations and higher costs for energy  principally natural gas  up million  labor and benefit costs  up million  and new technology systems  up million 
costs were also affected by the poor performance of the specialty packaging operations 
partially offsetting these increases were lower occ costs  down million  and lower depreciation expense  down million 
the changes in costs in were due to higher energy costs  up million  and higher occ costs coupled with increased outside purchases of corrugating medium 
energy costs began to rise during the second quarter and continued to rise through the second quarter energy costs peaked during the second quarter and began to decline the remainder of reaching more normalized levels by year end occ represented percent  percent and percent of the fiber requirements during the last three years 
occ prices began to decline near the end of the second quarter and continued to decline through the second quarter occ prices have remained relatively constant since then 
occ costs averaged per ton in  per ton in and per ton in year end occ prices were per ton in  per ton in and per ton in the reduction in depreciation expense was due to the lengthening of estimated useful lives of certain production equipment beginning january mill production was million tons in  million tons in and million tons in of the mill linerboard production  percent in and percent in and was used by the corrugated packaging operations  the remainder was sold in the domestic and export markets 
production was affected by curtailments due to market  maintenance and operational factors in and and by the conversion of the newport medium mill  ton annual capacity in production curtailments totaled  tons in and  tons in production curtailments were minimal in the no 
paper machine  ton annual capacity at the orange  texas linerboard mill was shut down for an indefinite period in december due to weak market conditions 
absent an improvement in market conditions  it is likely that the paper group will continue to curtail production in the joint venture conversion of the newport mill to enable it to produce lightweight gypsum facing paper was completed during third quarter start up and production issues coupled with weak market conditions have hampered this venture 
consequently  the mill continues to produce some corrugating medium  a large portion of which was purchased by the paper group   tons in and  tons in the joint venture expects to have the production issues resolved during the first quarter  however  it is uncertain when market conditions for gypsum facing paper will improve 
the paper group is continuing its efforts to enhance return on investment  including reviewing operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determining appropriate courses of actions 
during  the paper group sold its corrugated packaging operation in chile at a loss of million 
the paper group also restructured and downsized its specialty packaging operations at a loss of million and recognized an impairment charge of million related to its interest in a glass bottling venture operation in puerto rico 
these losses are included in other expenses 
other initiatives included the december sale of the bleached paperboard operation  which resulted in a loss on disposal of million 
the paper group s operating income was million in  million in and million in the building products group the building products group manufactures a variety of building products including lumber  particleboard  medium density fiberboard mdf and gypsum wallboard 
the building products group operations consist of facilities including a particleboard plant and an mdf plant operated under long term operating lease agreements and interests in a gypsum joint venture and an mdf joint venture 
the building products group operates in the united states and canada and manages the company s million acres of owned and leased timberlands located in texas  louisiana  georgia and alabama 
the building products group s revenues were million in  million in and million in average prices for lumber  particleboard  and gypsum fell during during  prices for lumber were down percent  particleboard down percent and gypsum down percent while prices for mdf were up percent due to improved product mix 
for  shipments of lumber were up percent  particleboard down percent  gypsum down percent and mdf up percent 
lumber shipments were up primarily due to the new pineland sawmill  which began operations in second quarter particleboard shipments were down due to the explosion at the mount jewett facility  which closed the facility for about five months during and weaker market conditions 
other revenue includes sales of small tracts of high value use timberlands million in  million in and million in and deliveries under a long term fiber supply agreement entered into in connection with the sale of the bleached paperboard operations 
the lumber  particleboard and gypsum markets continue to be affected by over capacity and weak demand 
it is likely that these conditions will continue for much of the mdf markets could also be affected by new industry capacity coming on line in costs  which include production  distribution and administrative costs  were million in  million in and million in the change in costs in was due to lower production volumes  lower depreciation expense and the disposition of the fiber cement venture during the third quarter offset by higher energy costs  principally natural gas 
fiber costs were relatively unchanged 
depreciation expense was reduced by million due to the lengthening of estimated useful lives of certain production equipment beginning january energy costs were up million 
energy costs peaked during the second quarter and began to decline during the remainder of reaching more normalized levels by year end the change in costs in was due to additional manufacturing facilities  an increase in energy costs  up million  and million of operating losses from the fiber cement venture 
production was curtailed due to market conditions to varying degrees in most product lines beginning the third quarter and continuing through year end for  production averaged from a low of percent to a high of percent of capacity in the various product lines 
production curtailments were minimal in the building products group s joint venture operations also experienced production curtailments during due to market conditions 
during the first quarter  the mdf joint venture in el dorado  arkansas was shut down due to market conditions  higher energy prices and reconstruction of the heat energy system of the plant 
production at this facility resumed in the second quarter absent an improvement in market conditions  it is likely that the building products group and its joint venture operations will continue to curtail production to varying degrees in the various product lines in the building products group is continuing its efforts to enhance return on investment  including reviewing operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determining appropriate courses of action 
during  the building products group performed a review of its  acres of timberlands in georgia and alabama and identified approximately  acres of non strategic fee and leased timberlands 
during september  approximately  acres of these non strategic timberlands were sold for million resulting in a gain of million  which is included in other income 
the remaining non strategic timberlands will be sold over time 
this review also identified approximately  acres of timberlands in georgia that will be converted over time to higher value use 
in addition  the building products group is addressing production cost issues at its mdf facilities 
the building products group s operating income was million in  million in and million in the financial services group the financial services group operates a savings bank and engages in mortgage banking  real estate and insurance brokerage activities 
the savings bank  guaranty bank guaranty  primarily conducts business through banking centers in texas and california

the provision for loan losses was million in  million in and million in the increase in was primarily the result of a decline in asset quality related to loans in the construction and development senior housing and commercial and business asset based portfolios 
loan growth and a change in the mix of the loan portfolio affected both and noninterest income includes service charges  fees  and the revenues from mortgage banking  real estate and insurance activities 
noninterest income was million in and million in and in the growth in noninterest income in was due to increased mortgage banking and insurance revenues and fee based products 
mortgage banking revenues were up almost percent due to acquisitions and the high level of refinance activity resulting from low interest rates 
this was partially offset by a reduction in servicing revenues due to the sale of billion in loans during the second quarter and an increase in amortization expense and impairment reserves due to the high level of prepayments 
in  the growth in fee based products was offset by declines in mortgage banking revenues due to the impact of the higher interest rate environment on mortgage financing and refinancing activities 
noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits  real estate operations  occupancy and data processing expenses

these changes to the loan portfolio provide further product and geographic diversification 
lending activities are subject to underwriting standards and liquidity considerations 
specific underwriting criteria for each type of loan are outlined in a credit policy approved by the board of directors of the savings bank 
in general  commercial loans are evaluated based on cash flow  collateral  market conditions  prevailing economic trends  character and leverage capacity of the borrower and capital and investment in a particular property  if applicable 
most small business and consumer loans are underwritten using credit scoring models that consider factors including payment capacity  credit history and collateral 
in addition  market conditions  economic trends and the character of the borrower are considered 
the credit policy  including the underwriting criteria for loan categories  is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted when warranted 
construction and development and commercial and business loans by maturity date at year end follow construction and development commercial and business variable rate fixed rate variable rate fixed rate total in millions due within one year   after one but within five years   after five years asset quality several important measures are used to evaluate and monitor asset quality

interest payments received on nonperforming loans are applied to reduce principal if there is doubt as to the collectibility of contractually due principal and interest 
nonperforming loans increased in due to loans in the construction and development senior housing and commercial and business asset based portfolios 
one of the asset based loans was affected by the events of september   and is currently being restructured 
this increase in nonperforming loans resulted in a decline in the allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans  percent at year end compared with percent at year end the allowance as a percent of total loans increased to percent at year end compared with percent at year end nonperforming loans declined in both dollars and as a percent of total loans in  the allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans increased in loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more  and restructured or other potential problem loans were less than percent of total loans as of the most recent five year ends 
the aggregate amounts and the interest income foregone on such loans are immaterial 
the investment in impaired loans was million at year end and million at year end  with a related allowance for loan losses of million and million  respectively 
the average investment in impaired loans during and was million and million  respectively 
the related amount of interest income recognized on impaired loans for and was immaterial 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific allowances  general allowances and an unallocated allowance 
management continuously evaluates the allowance for loan losses to ensure the level is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by charges to income and by the portion of the purchase price related to credit risk on loans acquired through bulk purchases and acquisitions  and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
specific allowances are based on a thorough review of the financial condition of the borrower  general economic conditions affecting the borrower  collateral values and other factors 
general allowances are based on historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors  including delinquency rates  current economic conditions  loan size  industry competition and consolidation  and the effect of government regulation 
the unallocated allowance provides for inherent loss exposures not yet identified 
the evaluation of the appropriate level of unallocated allowance considers current risk factors that may not be apparent in historical factors used to determine the specific and general allowances 
these factors include inherent delays in obtaining information and the volatility of economic conditions 
changes in the allowance for loan losses were for the year in millions balance at beginning of year charge offs real estate mortgage commercial and business consumer and other recoveries real estate mortgage consumer and other net charge offs additions charged to operations acquisitions and bulk purchases of loans  net of adjustments balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs during the year to average loans outstanding during the year 




an analysis of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses follows 
allocation of a portion of the allowance does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories of loans 
at year end category category category category as a of as a of as a of as a of total total total total allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans in millions real estate mortgage construction and development commercial and business consumer and other unallocated total at year end category as a of total allowance loans in millions real estate mortgage construction and development commercial and business consumer and other unallocated total the allowance allocated to real estate mortgage was down in due to a reduction in loans outstanding and improved credit quality and down in due to charge offs of loans previously provided for 
the amount allocated to construction and development was up in and due to loans in the senior housing industry 
the amount allocated to commercial and business loans was up in due to the growth in asset based lending partially offset by charge offs of syndicated loans previously provided for 
the decrease in the unallocated allowance in was the result of a more mature construction and development portfolio reducing construction period and lease up risk 
the unallocated amount was up in as a reflection of slowing economic activity and an increase in the size of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is considered adequate based on information currently available 
however  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates and intent as to asset disposition options 
in addition  regulatory authorities periodically review the allowance for loan losses as a part of their examination process 
based on their review  the regulatory authorities may require adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment about the information available to them at the time of their review 
mortgage banking activities mortgage loan originations were billion in  billion in and billion in the record production in was due to the acquisition of production operations in the upper mid west and mid atlantic regions and the high level of refinance activity resulting from the low interest rate environment 
higher interest rates during resulted in a significant reduction in mortgage refinancing activity  contributing to a reduction in mortgage loan originations 
mortgage servicing portfolio runoff was percent in  percent in and percent in the changes in the runoff rates are due to the lower interest rate environments in and  leading to high levels of refinancing  and a relatively higher interest rate environment in resulting in low levels of refinancing 
the mortgage servicing portfolio was billion at year end and billion at year end the decrease was due to the sale of billion in servicing during the second quarter and the accelerated runoff rate 
the accelerated runoff rate was due to prepayments in the lower rate environment  partially offset by the retention of servicing on a portion of the mortgage loans originated 
other matters the financial services group is continuing its efforts to enhance return on investment  including reviewing operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determining appropriate courses of action 
during january and february  a plan was enacted to exit certain businesses and product delivery methods that were not expected to meet return objectives in the near term 
this action resulted in a reduction in force and the write off of certain technology investments  however  the ongoing cost savings from these actions is anticipated to exceed significantly the related severance and write off expenses 
during  the financial services group completed acquisitions that significantly increased its mortgage production capacity 
in addition  the mortgage loan servicing portfolio was reduced by approximately percent during the year through a bulk sale of servicing and an increase in the sale of servicing with loan production 
the acquisitions and change in the size of the servicing portfolio were designed to reposition the mortgage banking operations to be more of a production operation and to minimize impairment risk associated with mortgage servicing rights

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk temple inland is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments such as adjustable rate debt and other borrowings  as well as the lending and deposit gathering activities of the financial services group 
the following table illustrates the estimated impact on pre tax income of immediate  parallel and sustained shifts in interest rates for the subsequent month period at year end  with comparative information at year end increase decrease in income before taxes change in interest rates in millions the change in exposure to interest rate risk from year end is primarily due to changes in the composition of assets and liabilities in the financial services group 
the operations of the financial services group s savings bank are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different times or in differing amounts 
since year end  the duration of the liabilities has lengthened while the duration of the assets has shortened 
the lengthened duration of liabilities is the result of significant originations in longer term fixed rate certificates of deposit 
the shortened duration of assets is the result of composition changes caused by increased prepayments on the mortgage and mortgage backed securities portfolios  stemming from the lower interest rate environment  and the growth in the loan portfolio 
additionally  the fair value of the financial services group s mortgage servicing rights estimated at million at year end is also affected by changes in interest rates 
temple inland estimates that a percent decline in interest rates from current levels would decrease the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights by approximately million 
foreign currency risk the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on its financial instruments is not material because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk from time to time the company uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to changes in product pricing and manufacturing costs 
these instruments cover a small portion of the company s volume and range in duration from three months to three years 
based on the fair value of these instruments at year end  the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent change in the underlying commodity prices would not be significant
