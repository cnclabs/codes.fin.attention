item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the results of operations for the years ended december   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k and in conjunction with the risk factors described below 
overview we develop  market and sell high speed  multi port network performance analysis systems for advanced optical communications equipment and networks  as well as electrical communications equipment and networks 
our products address a broad range of network equipment and systems that are used throughout the internet and local  metropolitan and wide area networks 
our products allow customers to generate network and internet protocol traffic and analyze the performance  accuracy and reliability of equipment and systems that they either manufacture for sale to others or purchase for use in their own networks 
our customers include manufacturers of network equipment  internet and network service providers  communications chip manufacturers and network users 
our product offerings include a variety of interface cards  chassis that can hold up to interface cards each and related software products 
our interface cards can generate traffic over a variety of optical and electrical interfaces such as packet over sonet and gigabit ethernet 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our net revenues by principal product category in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  products in thousands  except percentages optical interface cards electrical interface cards chassis  software and other products total sales to our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately million  or  of our net revenues in  million  or  in and million  or  in to date  we have sold our systems primarily to network equipment manufacturers 
while we expect that we will continue to have some customer concentration for the foreseeable future  we have sold our systems to a wide variety of customers 
through december   we had shipped our systems to approximately customers 
to the extent we develop a broader and more diverse customer base  we anticipate that our reliance on any one customer will diminish 
net revenues 
our revenues consist primarily of product sales 
the hardware and software components of our products are sold as an integrated system 
the software component of our products does not require significant modification or customization  and our sales do not involve any significant future obligations or customer acceptance terms 
accordingly  revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment 
we warrant our products for one year after sale 
at the time of sale we defer that portion of our revenues that relates to our post contract support and recognize it ratably over the month service period 
revenues from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 

table of contents cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  payments to third party manufacturers  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel and the warranty cost of hardware to be replaced during the one year warranty period 
we outsource the majority of our manufacturing operations  and we conduct final assembly  supply chain management  quality assurance  documentation control and shipping at our facility 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
in addition  cost of revenues includes a non cash component related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation allocated to manufacturing personnel 
gross margins 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation  the gross margins of our various interface cards have generally been consistent and have exceeded the gross margins of our chassis 
in general  our gross margins are primarily affected by the following factors the mix of our products sold  the pricing we are able to obtain from our component suppliers and contract manufacturers  new product introductions by us and by our competitors  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  demand for our products  production volume  and the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold 
operating expenses 
we generally recognize our operating expenses as we incur them in three general operational categories research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel and consulting costs related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our systems 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we also capitalize and depreciate over a two year period some costs of our systems used for internal purposes 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we seek to attain our strategic product development objectives and to meet changing customer requirements and technological advances 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales and marketing and customer support functions  as well as costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in line with revenue increases 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  human resources  information technology and administrative personnel  as well as recruiting and professional fees  insurance costs and other general corporate expenses  including rent 
we expect modest sequential increases in general and administrative expenses as the company continues to grow 
in connection with the grant of stock options and warrants and the sale of restricted stock  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million in and million in these amounts represent the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of the options or warrants at the date of grant or the purchase price of the restricted stock 
deferred stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity  with amortization recorded over the vesting period  which is typically four years 
in  we reduced the deferred stock based compensation balance by million as a result of the forfeitures of stock options and changes in the market value of the company s common stock that affected certain equity instruments which received variable accounting treatment 
we amortized to the respective operating expense categories million of deferred stock based compensation in  million in and million in based on the unvested options  warrants and stock subject to repurchase as of december  
table of contents we expect to record additional stock based compensation expense relating to deferred stock based compensation approximately as follows million during  million during and  during the amount of deferred stock based compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options and stock subject to repurchase for which unearned compensation has been recorded are forfeited or repurchased 
changes in the market value of the company s common stock could also affect future stock based compensation expense related to equity instruments  which receive variable accounting treatment 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolete inventory  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
we recognize revenue as discussed in the overview section 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand is less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas which generally requires us to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
upon implementation of sfas on january   we will use the fair value method to assess our goodwill annually and the undiscounted cash flows method will continue to be used for qualifying identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these

in  net revenues increased to million from the million recorded in net revenues in were positively affected by sales to new customers and the introduction of new product lines during the year 
this increase was offset by a significant reduction in customer orders across all product lines due to the slowdown in the economy and in telecommunications spending 
sales to our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately million or of our net revenues in compared to million or of net revenues in gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in our gross margin decreased to in from in this decrease in gross margin primarily reflects changes in the product mix of products sold in as compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in stock based compensation included in research and development expense decreased to million in from million in excluding stock based compensation  research and development expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to higher compensation and related benefit costs as a result of the addition of engineering personnel and increased prototype costs associated with new product development 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in stock based compensation included in sales and marketing expense decreased to million 
table of contents in from million in excluding stock based compensation  sales and marketing expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in the number of direct sales and marketing personnel and fixed asset depreciation on demonstration and evaluation equipment

liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash generated from operations in  and was primarily provided by net income adjusted for significant non cash expenses and changes in working capital requirements 
additionally  for  million of the million of cash provided by operations relates to the timing of payments for our estimated income tax liability 
due to the method in which estimated income tax payments are made  in we paid only  in estimated taxes during the year and  as of december   we had accrued million in income taxes payable 
during march  we made an estimated income tax payment of million relating to the liability 
had this payment been made in  net cash provided by operations would have been million in and million in cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities in consisted of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of caimis  inc  which was completed in november  and capital expenditures for property and equipment

financing activities provided net cash of million in  million in and used net cash of  in financing activities in consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the proceeds from related party receivables 
in  financing activities included million from the completion of our initial public offering in october  proceeds from option exercises and proceeds from a related party receivable 
financing activities in consisted of repayment of a  note issued to a shareholder and cash proceeds from the sale of common stock and stock option exercises 
as of december  we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
as of december  we had total minimum lease obligations of million through may  under non cancelable operating leases 
we do not have any capital leases 
on february   the company completed the acquisition from empirix  inc of the assets associated with the production and sale of the anvl automated network validation library product line 
the purchase price was million in cash 
in addition  a contingent cash payment of up to million may be paid based upon our sales through march  of anvl products and services 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and cash flow expected to be generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the growth rate of our net revenues  our profitability  our capital expenditures  acquisition of key technology  working capital requirements  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and the expansion of our sales  marketing and technical support efforts 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of 
table of contents accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the company has accounted for the acquisition of caimis  inc in accordance with the provisions of sfas in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective january  sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires the company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption and annually or whenever events or circumstance occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
the company has accounted for the acquisition of caimis  inc in accordance with the provisions of sfas under the transition provisions of sfas  the company has not recorded amortization of goodwill relating to the caimis  inc acquisition 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
risk factors the statements that are not historical facts contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements reflect the current belief  expectations or intent of the company s management and are subject to and involve certain risks and uncertainties 
many of these risks and uncertainties are outside of our control and are difficult for us to forecast or mitigate 
in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in certain of our other securities and exchange act commission filings  the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by us in any forward looking statements contained herein or made elsewhere by or on behalf of ixia 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of new product introductions and other factors which could cause our stock price to decline significantly our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  most of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that could cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate include the other risks discussed in this risk factors section 
we may experience a shortfall or delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons 
orders on hand at the beginning of a quarter and orders generated in a quarter do not always result in the shipment of products and the recognition of revenues for that quarter 
failure to ship products by the end of the quarter in which they are ordered may adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
our customer agreements typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty 
because we incur operating expenses based on anticipated revenues trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our quarterly results of operations 
additionally  our operating results may vary as a result of the timing of our release of new products 
the introduction of a new product in any quarter may cause an increase in revenues in that quarter that may not be sustainable in subsequent quarters 

table of contents if we are unable to successfully introduce new products to keep pace with the rapid technological changes that characterize our market  our results of operations will be significantly harmed the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change such as the recent development of optical fiber and wireless technologies  frequent new product introductions such as higher speed and more complex routers  evolving industry standards such as new internet protocols  changing customer needs such as the increase in the levels of service agreed to between network service providers and their customers  and short product life cycles as a result of rapid changes in our customers products 
we expect that new technologies will continue to emerge as the need for higher and more cost effective bandwidth increases 
our performance will depend on our successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced performance analysis products that address these new technologies and changes in customer requirements 
if we experience any delay in the development or introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products  our operating results may suffer 
for instance  undetected software or hardware errors  which frequently occur when new products are first introduced  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and the loss of credibility with our customers 
in addition  if we are not able to develop  or license from third parties  the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements  our existing products are likely to become technologically obsolete over time and our operating results will suffer 
if the rate of development of new technologies and transmission protocols by our customers is delayed  the growth of the market for our products and therefore our sales and operating results may be harmed 
our ability to successfully introduce new products in a timely fashion will depend on several factors  including our ability to anticipate technological changes and industry trends  properly identify customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  hire and retain necessary technical personnel  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  timely obtain key components for the manufacture of new products  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  price our products competitively  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely or cost effective basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  emerging industry standards or product announcements by our 
table of contents competitors 
if we fail to respond to technological change and the needs of our markets  we will lose revenues and our competitive position will suffer 
we depend on sales of a narrow range of products and if customers do not purchase our products  our revenues and results of operations would be significantly harmed our business and products are concentrated in the market for systems that analyze and measure the performance of network equipment and systems 
this market is in an early stage of development and there is uncertainty regarding its size and scope 
our performance will depend on increased sales of our existing systems and the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing these sales or in developing and introducing new products 
our failure to do so would significantly harm our revenues and results of operations 
some key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply  which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase a number of key components used to manufacture our products from sole or limited sources of supply for which alternative sources may not be available 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages of key components  including chips  oscillators and optical modules 
we and our contract manufacturers have no guaranteed or long term supply arrangements for these or other components  including field programmable gate arrays  or fpga s  which are integrated circuits that can be repeatedly reprogrammed to perform different sets of functions as required 
financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in market demand for necessary components could limit the availability to us and our contract manufacturers of these components 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales 
in addition  the purchase of these components on a sole source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems 
consolidation involving suppliers could further reduce the number of alternatives available to us and affect the cost of components 
an increase in the cost of components could make our products less competitive and result in lower margins 
there are no substitute supplies available for many of these components  including field programmable gate arrays 
all of these components are critical to the production of our products  and competition exists with other manufacturers for these key components 
in the event that we can no longer obtain materials from a sole source supplier  we might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion  or at all 
competition in our market could significantly harm our results of operations the market for our products is highly competitive 
we face competition primarily from test equipment manufacturers such as agilent technologies and spirent communications 
we also compete with start up companies such as antara and gnubi  which are focused on network performance analysis and measurement 
in the network monitoring and optimization market we expect to compete with test equipment manufacturers such as exfo as well as with start up companies  such as brix and adlex 
additionally  some of our network equipment manufacturer customers have developed  or may develop  in house performance analysis products for their own use or for sale to others 
for example  cisco systems  our largest customer  has used internally developed test products for a number of years 
although cisco systems has always accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues  we cannot assure you that it will continue to do so 
as we broaden our product offerings  we may move into new markets and face additional competition 
moreover  our competitors may have more experience operating in these new markets and be better established with the customers in these new markets 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution capabilities than we do 
moreover  our competitors may 
table of contents consolidate with each other  or with other companies  giving them even greater capabilities with which to compete against us 
increased competition in the network performance analysis and measurement market could result in increased pressure on us to reduce prices and could result in a reduction in our revenues and or a decrease in our margins  each of which could significantly harm our results of operations 
in addition  increased competition could prevent us from increasing our market share  or cause us to lose our existing market share  either of which would harm our revenues and profitability 
we cannot predict whether our current or future competitors will develop or market technologies and products that offer higher performance or more features or are more cost effective than our current or future products 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop cost effective products and product enhancements which offer higher performance and more functionality 
our failure to do so will harm our revenues and results of operations 
if we do not diversify our customer base  we may not be able to grow our business or increase our profitability our growth depends in part on our ability to diversify our customer base by increasing sales to internet and network service providers  communications chip manufacturers and network users 
to effectively compete for the business of these customers  we must develop new products and enhancements to existing products and expand our sales  marketing and customer support capabilities  which will result in increases in operating costs 
if we cannot offset these increases in costs with an increase in our revenues  our net income and our stock price may fall 
some of our existing and potential competitors have existing relationships with many internet and network service providers  communications chip manufacturers and network users 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing our sales presence in these markets 
any failure by us to increase sales in these markets would adversely affect our growth 
because we depend on a limited number of network equipment manufacturers for a majority of our revenues  any cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations historically  a small number of network equipment manufacturing customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues 
sales to our five largest customers represented of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and our net revenues in sales to cisco systems  our largest customer  accounted for of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future and that our operating results will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers 
our dependence on large orders from a limited number of network equipment manufacturers makes our relationships with these manufacturers critical to the success of our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers  that we will be able to increase our sales to our other existing customers or that we will be able to attract additional customers 
from time to time  we have experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers 
in addition  our customers have sought price concessions from us and may continue to do so 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers  and our major customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our competitors 
the loss of one or more of our largest customers  any reduction or delay in sales to these customers  our inability to successfully develop and maintain relationships with existing and new customers or requirements that we make price concessions could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations 

table of contents as our customers consolidate  they may reduce purchases of our products and demand more favorable terms and conditions from us  which would harm our revenues and profitability consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold 
some of our customers have recently merged 
these merged customers could obtain products from a source other than us or demand more favorable terms and conditions from us  which would harm our revenues and profitability 
in addition  our network equipment manufacturer customers may merge with or acquire our competitors and discontinue their relationships with us 
if we are unable to expand our sales and distribution channels or are unable to successfully manage our expanded sales organization  our revenues and results of operations will be harmed historically  we have relied primarily on a limited direct sales organization  supported by third party manufacturers representatives and distributors  to sell our products 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding our direct sales organization and our network of manufacturers representatives and distributors 
we may not be able to successfully expand our sales and distribution channels  and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenues that we generate 
to the extent that we are successful in expanding our sales and distribution channels  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against the significantly larger and better funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential competitors 
we have granted exclusive rights to substantially all of our distributors and manufacturers representatives to market our products in their specified territories 
our distributors and manufacturers representatives may not market our products effectively or devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
our inability to effectively manage the expansion of our sales and support staff  or to maintain existing or establish new relationships with successful manufacturers representatives and distributors  would harm our revenues and results of operations 
if we are unable to expand our international sales and distribution channels or manage them effectively  our results of operations would be harmed historically  a significant portion of our sales have been made to customers in the united states 
sales in the united states accounted for of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in in the past  we have depended on distributors for the substantial majority of our international sales 
the loss of one or more of our international distributors or their failure to sell our products would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenues in international markets 
we intend to expand or enter into additional international markets  including europe and the asia pacific region  by adding distributors and international sales and support personnel 
our failure in these efforts could significantly harm our results of operations and decrease the value of our stock 
we only have limited international sales experience and believe that the growth of our sales outside of the united states will be subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties  including adoption of different local technical and regulatory standards  the need to maintain and establish new relationships with distributors and the sales performance of these distributors  who may not be as effective or loyal as our employees  the costs and complexity of staffing and managing more widely dispersed foreign sales activities  including the ability to identify  attract and retain qualified managers and sales personnel  overcoming cultural  linguistic and nationalistic barriers and adapting to foreign business practices  longer payment cycles of foreign customers compared with customers in the united states  seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world  such as during the summer months in europe  legal uncertainties regarding liability  export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  
table of contents potential political and economic instability  and inadequate protection of intellectual property in some countries 
any of these factors could significantly harm our international sales or significantly impair our ability to expand into international markets 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less cost effective in international markets 
if we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs and experience manufacturing delays we provide our contract manufacturers with rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our manufacturing requirements 
some of the components used in our products have significant lead times or lead times which may unexpectedly increase depending on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and the demand for components at a given time 
because of these long lead times  we are often forced to forecast and order products before we know what our specific manufacturing requirements will be 
if we overestimate our product orders  our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory of completed products which we would be obligated to purchase 
this will lead to increased costs and the risk of obsolescence 
if we underestimate our product orders  our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory  which could result in delays in shipments  the loss or deferral of revenues and higher costs of sales 
it may also add costs to our products to expedite delivery of our products to customers or those components with long lead times to our contract manufacturers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately forecast our product orders and may in the future carry excess or obsolete inventory  be unable to fulfill customer demand  or both  thereby harming our revenues  results of operations and customer relationships 
failure by our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products could harm our revenues  results of operations  competitive position and reputation we currently rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our products 
we may experience delays in receiving product shipments from contract manufacturers or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by effectively coordinating with our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
we do not have any long term contracts with our contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of any of our contract manufacturers would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill customer orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would harm our revenues  results of operations  competitive position and reputation 
we may not be able to expand our contract manufacturing capacity or our internal testing or quality assurance functions as required to keep up with demand for our products 
any such failure would in turn hinder our growth 
if we do not expand these capacities and functions effectively or in a timely manner  we may experience disruptions in product flow which could limit our revenues  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional cost  cancellation of orders or both 
because of intense competition for technical personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel on a cost effective basis our success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  hire  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
we plan to increase the number of our research and development  marketing  sales  customer support 
table of contents and operations employees 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense 
in addition  employees may leave our company and subsequently compete against us 
our failure to attract and retain these qualified employees could significantly harm our ability to develop new products and maintain customer relationships 
the loss of the services of any of our qualified employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could hinder the development and introduction of new and enhanced products and harm our ability to sell our products 
moreover  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may be subject to such claims as we seek to retain or hire qualified personnel  some of whom may currently be working for our competitors 
some of these claims may result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us 
the loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management  technical  marketing and sales employees  particularly errol ginsberg  our president and chief executive officer 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our key employees or that we can attract or retain additional skilled personnel as required 
failure to retain key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position 
continued rapid growth will strain our operations and require us to incur costs to maintain and upgrade our management and operational resources we have experienced and are continuing to experience a period of growth 
unless we manage our growth effectively  we may have difficulty in operating our business 
as a result  we may inaccurately forecast sales and materials requirements  fail to integrate new personnel or fail to maintain adequate internal controls  which may result in fluctuations in our operating results and cause the price of our stock to decline 
we plan to continue to expand our operations which may place a significant strain on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage our growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
if we cannot manage growth effectively  our profitability could be significantly harmed 
our products may contain defects which may cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers our existing products and any new or enhanced products we introduce may contain undetected software or hardware defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
these problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relation problems or loss of customers and reputation  all of which would harm our results of operations 
a successful claim against us for an amount exceeding the limit on our product liability insurance policy would force us to use our own resources  to the extent available  to pay the claim  which could result in an increase in our expenses and a reduction of our working capital available for other uses  thereby harming our profitability and capital resources 
our failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our results of operations and reputation our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary rights to our intellectual property 
we currently rely on a combination of trade secret  trademark and copyright laws to establish and protect our intellectual property 
we also expect to rely on patents to protect some of our proprietary technology 
to date  we have relied primarily on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary processes and know how 
although we have filed applications for two us patents  we cannot assure you that either 
table of contents of these applications will issue into patents or that  if issued  the patents will be upheld 
we also cannot assure you that such patents  if issued  will be effective in protecting our proprietary technology 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our officers  employees and consultants 
we also generally limit access to and distribution of our source code and further limit the disclosure and use of our other proprietary information 
however  these measures provide only limited protection of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may not have signed agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case  and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances 
further  we have not included copyright notices on all of our copyrightable intellectual property 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of one or more competitive advantages and decreased revenues 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing trade secret  copyright  patent and trademark laws afford us only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
others may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to deter others from developing similar technologies 
further  monitoring the unauthorized use of our products and our proprietary rights is difficult 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products from time to time  other parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
we cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights 
we have not conducted a search to determine whether the technology we have in our products infringes or misappropriates intellectual property held by third parties 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which could relate to our products 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could significantly harm our results of operations 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  require us to develop alternative technology  thereby causing product shipment delays and the loss or deferral of revenues  require us to cease selling the products containing the infringing intellectual property  require us to pay substantial damage awards  damage our reputation  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents in the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our revenues  results of operations and competitive position would be harmed 
we are exposed to general economic and market conditions our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
in recent quarters  our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending in the united states  europe and asia 
in particular  sales to network equipment manufacturers in north america were adversely affected during fiscal if the economic conditions do not improve  or if there is a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
some of our customers may not have the resources to pay for our products or to order our products as a result of the current economic environment with the recent economic slowdown  some of our customers are forecasting that their revenue for the foreseeable future will generally be lower than anticipated 
some of these customers are experiencing  or are likely to experience  serious cash flow problems  and they are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms  if at all 
as a result  if some of these customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or securing alternate financing arrangements  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment for the amounts that they owe us 
furthermore  they may not order as many products from us as originally forecast or any products at all 
the inability of our customers to pay us for our products will adversely affect our cash flow and the timing of our revenue recognition and harm our results of operation 
the failure of our customers to order product will also result in decreased revenues 
if we fail to maintain our relationships with industry experts  our products may lose industry and market recognition and sales could decline our relationships with industry experts in the field of performance analysis and measurement of networks and network equipment are critical for maintaining our industry credibility and for developing new products and testing methodologies in a timely fashion 
these experts have established standard testing methodologies that evaluate new network equipment products and technologies 
we provide these experts and their testing labs with our products and engineering assistance to perform tests on these new network equipment products and technologies 
these industry experts refer to our products in their publications which has given our products industry recognition 
in addition  these labs offer us the opportunity to test our products on the newest network equipment and technologies  thereby assisting us in developing new products that are designed to meet evolving technological needs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our relationships with industry experts or that our competitors will not obtain similar or superior relationships with industry experts 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with industry experts  our products may lose industry and market recognition which could harm our reputation and competitive position and cause our sales to decline 
acquisitions undertaken and any that we may undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute shareholder value and significantly harm our operating results on november   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of caimis  inc  and on february   we completed the acquisition from empirix  inc of the assets associated with the producing of the anvl automated network validation library product line 
we expect to continue to review opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway  we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any further acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute existing shareholders percentage 
table of contents ownership  incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies and believe acquisitions could involve the following risks problems assimilating the acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers  contract manufacturers  customers and industry experts  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of the acquired organization s or our own key employees 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems in connection with our past or future acquisitions  and our inability to do so could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations 
our headquarters  many of our customers and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in california where natural disasters may occur currently  our corporate headquarters  many of our customers and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in california 
california historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we and some of our customers  contract manufacturers and suppliers do not have redundant  multiple site capacity 
in the event of a natural disaster  our ability to conduct business could be significantly disrupted  thereby harming our results of operations 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and an agreement with our principal shareholder may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefits to our shareholders our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock are subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
furthermore  some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
technology capital group sa  our principal shareholder  has agreed that for a period of three years beyond october or until any earlier time that it owns less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  it will provide us with at least days advance notice before agreeing to a sale or other disposition of one percent or more of our outstanding shares in a private transaction 
this notice requirement may delay a third party s acquisition of the shares of our common stock held by technology capital group and also provide us with an opportunity to propose other buyers for the shares who may be more acceptable to us  to propose to repurchase the shares proposed to be sold or to propose to register the shares for sale in an underwritten public offering 
this notice requirement may also discourage third parties from attempting to acquire the shares of our common stock held by technology capital group during that period 
these provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and this agreement may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in our control despite possible benefits to our shareholders  may discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may harm the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our shareholders

we do not have any financial liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk 
we do not expect any material loss from our investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
we do not use any derivatives or similar instruments to manage our interest rate risk
