critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our investments are generally made in office properties 
we are  therefore  generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply of or demand for office properties or tenants for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our tenant s ability to honor their lease obligations which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectibility of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for tenant balances that are over days past due and for tenant receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes in their operations to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value 
as of december   none of the company s assets were considered to be impaired 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates and assumptions 
funds from operations 
management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in march  nareit issued a clarification of the definition of ffo 
the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets are not to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo 
in addition  effective january   nareit clarified that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results except those defined as extraordinary items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
the company s calculation of ffo shown below is consistent with nareit s recent clarification and includes an adjustment of  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively  to include gains on sales of real estate held for sale and real estate equity securities during those years 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents the company s ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income before extraordinary item adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates preferred dividends convertible preferred dividends gain loss on real estate amortization of discounts deferred gains and other funds from operations nareit has recommended supplemental disclosure concerning certain capital expenditures  leasing costs and straight line rents as shown below in thousands year ended december straight line rents amortization of restricted stock building improvements tenant improvements new leases lease renewals leasing commissions new leases lease renewals leasing commissions amortized upgrades on acquisitions anticipated at the date of purchase net gains on sale of real estate securities and land held for sale inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base rent if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate
