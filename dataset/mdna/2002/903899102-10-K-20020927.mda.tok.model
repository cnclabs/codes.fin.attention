general ultralife batteries  inc develops  manufactures and markets a wide range of standard and customized lithium primary non rechargeable and rechargeable batteries for use in a wide array of applications 
the company believes that its technologies allow the company to offer batteries that are flexibly configured  lightweight and generally achieve longer operating time than many competing batteries currently available 
the company has focused on manufacturing a family of lithium primary batteries for industrial  military and consumer applications  which it believes is one of the most comprehensive lines of lithium manganese dioxide primary batteries commercially available 
the company also supplies rechargeable and lithium ion batteries for use in portable electronic applications 
for several years  the company has incurred net operating losses primarily as a result of funding research and development activities and  to a lesser extent  incurring manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs 
during fiscal  the company realigned its resources to bring costs more in line with revenues  moving the company closer to its targets of operating cash breakeven and profitability 
in addition  the company refined its rechargeable strategy to allow it to be more effective in the marketplace 
the company believes that its current growth strategy will be successful in the long term 
however  at the present time  the status of the company s cash and credit situation is of serious concern  and much of the company s ability to succeed in the near term is dependent upon continued revenue growth and a favorable product mix that will generate cash 
if the company is unsuccessful in growing the business sufficiently in the near term to generate adequate levels of cash  it will need to find alternative sources of funds to allow it to continue to operate in its current capacity 
some possible funding alternatives include obtaining additional debt  issuing equity or selling assets 
while the company has been successful at raising funds in the past and is optimistic that it will be able to do so again if necessary  there is no assurance that the company will be able to do so under the current circumstances 
the company reports its results in four operating segments primary batteries  rechargeable batteries  technology contracts and corporate 
the primary batteries segment includes volt  cylindrical and various other non rechargeable specialty batteries 
the rechargeable batteries segment includes the company s lithium polymer and lithium ion rechargeable batteries 
the technology contracts segment includes revenues and related costs associated with various government and military development contracts 
the corporate segment consists of all other items that do not specifically relate to the three other segments and are not considered in the performance of the other segments 
currently  the company does not experience significant seasonal trends in primary battery revenues and does not have enough sales history on the rechargeable batteries to determine if there is seasonality 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared with the fiscal year ended june  revenues 
total revenues of the company increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  primary battery sales increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the increase in primary battery sales was primarily due to growth in cylindrical battery sales  particularly to military customers  and higher volt battery sales 
rechargeable battery sales increased modestly from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june   as the company broadened its strategy in the latter portion of fiscal from simply selling polymer batteries it manufactures to selling a rechargeable solution that encompasses sourcing cells from other lithium battery manufacturers and assembling them to meet customer needs 
technology contract revenues decreased  from  to  due to the scheduled reduction of certain nonrenewable government contracts  which concluded in fiscal cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue improved from approximately to for the year ended june  consolidated gross margins improved from a negative in fiscal of sales to a positive in fiscal in october and november  the company realigned its resources to address changing market conditions and to better meet customer demand in areas of the business that were growing 
a majority of employees affected by this realignment were re deployed from the rechargeable segment and support functions into open direct labor positions in the primary segment  due to the significantly growing demand for primary batteries from the military 
again in february  the company took further actions to reduce costs in its ongoing effort to improve liquidity and to bring costs more in line with current and near term anticipated revenues 
these cost reductions included employee terminations and salary reductions  discontinuance of certain employee benefits and other cost savings initiatives in general and administrative areas 
overall  the company reduced its workforce by more than during the year 
approximately one half of these cost savings reduced cost of products sold  with the other half reducing r d and selling  general and administrative costs 
severance costs associated with these actions were incurred in the period of the force reductions  although they were not material 
in total  the actions taken during fiscal generated total cost savings of more than  per quarter from the expense run rate that the company experienced during its first quarter of fiscal in the primary battery segment  the cost of batteries sold increased  from  to  in  mainly related to increased sales volume 
as a percent of total primary battery sales  cost of primary products sold improved from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   reflecting improved manufacturing efficiencies related to higher volumes and the impact from certain of the cost savings initiatives referred to above  as well as the ongoing positive effects from the implementation of lean manufacturing disciplines 
in the rechargeable battery segment  the cost of products sold decreased  in fiscal from  in fiscal to  in during fiscal  in anticipation of significant increases in rechargeable sales volume  the company added resources to prepare for this expected growth 
as economic conditions changed during fiscal  the company reacted and reduced its resources accordingly by realigning its resources and reducing manpower as described above 
in general  the decrease in costs from to primarily resulted from the cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the year 
technology contracts cost of sales decreased  or approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june   in line with the decrease in revenues 
technology contracts cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in  consistent with the prior year 
operating and other expenses 
in june  the company recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of  this impairment charge related to a writedown of long lived assets in the company s rechargeable production operations  reflecting a change in the company s strategy 
changes in external economic conditions culminated in june  reflecting a slowdown in the mobile electronics marketplace and a realization that near term business opportunities utilizing the high volume rechargeable production equipment had dissipated 
these changes caused the company to shift away from high volume polymer rechargeable battery production to higher value  lower volume opportunities 
the company s redefined strategy eliminates the need for its high volume production line that had been built mainly to manufacture nokia cell phone replacement batteries 
the new strategy is a three pronged approach 
first  the company will manufacture in house for the higher value  lower volume polymer rechargeable opportunities 
second  the company will utilize its affiliate in taiwan  ultralife taiwan  inc  as a source for both polymer and liquid lithium cells 
third  the company will look to other rechargeable cell manufacturers as sources for cells that the company can then assemble into completed battery packs 
in the future  the impairment of the rechargeable fixed assets will result in lower depreciation charges of approximately  per year 
total operating and other expenses increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  excluding the impairment charge  operating and other expenses increased  from  in to  in  mainly as a result of higher research and development expenses 
operating and other expenses as a percentage of revenue  excluding the impairment charge  improved from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  research and development costs increased  or from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this increase was mainly due to higher costs related to the development of new cylindrical batteries for the military applications  as the company focused more extensively on this significant market opportunity 
r d expenditures related to rechargeable battery development diminished during the year as a result of the cost savings actions discussed previously 
the company anticipates that r d costs overall will decline significantly in fiscal as compared with due to the sizeable reduction in rechargeable development efforts and the expected near term transition of the new cylindrical battery development to manufacturing during fiscal selling  general and administration expenses decreased  approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june   even though revenues rose 
selling and marketing expenses declined  from fiscal to fiscal as a result of a more targeted sales coverage strategy using fewer resources and lower marketing and advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses  on the other hand  rose  as a result of higher insurance expenses and certain severance costs pertaining to an executive employment agreement incurred in conjunction with the company s resource realignment during the second fiscal quarter 
other income expense 
interest income decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this decrease is mainly the result of lower average balances of cash and investment securities  as well as lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased  form  in to  in as a result of lower average balances of debt 
equity loss in affiliates  pertaining to the company s equity interest in ultralife taiwan  inc uti  was zero in fiscal  compared with a loss of  in fiscal since uti continued to report losses during fiscal  the company did not reflect its share of the losses as the investment had been reduced to zero as of the end of miscellaneous income expense changed from an expense of  in to income of  in  primarily as a result of unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions due mainly to the strengthening of the uk pounds sterling relative to the us dollar 
net losses 
the consolidated net loss for the year ended june  was  or per share 
excluding the  impairment charge for long lived assets  the consolidated net loss improved  from a loss of  or per share  for the year ended june  to a loss of  or per share  for the year ended june   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
fiscal year ended june  compared with the fiscal year ended june  revenues 
total revenues of the company decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  primary battery sales increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the increase in primary battery sales was primarily due to the introduction of new cylindrical products in fiscal and an increase in volt battery shipments related to higher demand 
these increases were offset by a decline in sales from the uk subsidiary due to the delay in renewing a government contract 
rechargeable battery sales increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june   mainly as a result of the commercial launch of the company s polymer batteries in june and shipments of retail and custom sized batteries 
technology contract revenues decreased  from  to  due to the scheduled reduction of certain nonrenewable government contracts 
the company expects revenues from technology contracts to continue to decline in fiscal cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue increased from approximately to for the year ended june  cost of primary batteries sold decreased  from  or of revenues  for the year ended june  to  or of revenues  for the year ended june  the decrease in cost of primary batteries sold as a percentage of revenues was principally the result of improvements in the manufacturing process due to the implementation of lean manufacturing practices 
to date  lean manufacturing practices in the primary battery segment have resulted in the reduction of inventory  quicker manufacturing throughput times and improvements in operating efficiencies throughout the company 
in fiscal  the improvements in gross margins in the primary segment were offset by losses in the rechargeable segment 
rechargeable battery cost of products sold increased  in fiscal due to the launch of commercial production of polymer rechargeable batteries in june  which resulted in initial expenditures necessary to start production of the polymer cells  including approximately  in additional depreciation for the year  as equipment was placed in service 
prior to commencing production of polymer cells  most of these costs  including engineering  were charged to research and development 
technology contracts cost of sales decreased  or approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  technology contracts cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was consistent year over year 
operating and other expenses 
operating and other expenses decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  operating and other expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from approximately to for the year ended june  of the company s operating and other expenses  research and development expenses decreased  or from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  research and development expenses decreased due to the commercial launch of polymer rechargeable in june  which shifted costs to cost of sales 
selling  general and administration expenses increased  approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  selling and marketing expenses increased as a result of new sales people added to significantly enhance the company s overall market coverage 
other income expense 
net interest income decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the decrease in interest income is the result of lower average balances on cash and investment securities which were used for operations 
the equity loss of  in fiscal and  in fiscal resulted from the company s ownership interest in its venture in taiwan 
the increase in the equity loss includes compensation expense related to a stock distribution to uti employees totaling  the company recognized approximately  equity loss for the transaction representing its share of the total uti expense 
the gain on sale of securities of  in fiscal resulted from the sale of the company s investment in intermagnetics general corporation common shares 
no similar sale of securities occurred in net losses 
net losses increased  or approximately  from  or per share  for the year ended june  to  or per share  for the year ended june   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled  excluding restricted cash of  during the year ended june   the company used  of cash in operating activities as compared to  for the year ended june  cash used in operations in was mainly a result of the company s reported net loss  net of non cash items such as depreciation and impairment charges 
also during  accounts receivable rose  due to higher shipments made at the end of fiscal compared with  the  improvement in cash used in operations was primarily a result of decreasing net losses net of non cash expenses  offset in part by higher cash usage attributable to changes in working capital related to higher volumes of business 
in the year ended june   the company used  to purchase plant  property and equipment  which was offset by proceeds from a sale leaseback of  of the  of equipment purchases   related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment for the company s primary battery operations   related to rechargeable battery machinery and equipment and the balance was substantially for facilities upgrades 
months cost of sales in inventory at june  was months as compared to months at june  this metric is indicative of the company s continuing focus to improve purchasing procedures and inventory controls 
the company s days sales outstanding dsos was an average of days for  compared with an average of days for this modest slowdown in collections is mainly attributable to increased business with non us customers who typically take longer to pay than the us customers 
at june   the company had a capital lease obligation outstanding of  for the company s newark  new york offices and manufacturing facilities 
in addition  the company had a capital lease on computer equipment  which had an outstanding balance of  at june  as of june   the company had made commitments to purchase approximately  of production machinery and equipment 
in june  the company entered into a year   secured credit facility with a lending institution 
the financing agreement consisted of an initial  term loan component and a revolving credit facility component for an initial  based on eligible net accounts receivable as defined and eligible net inventory as defined 
the amount available under the term loan component amortizes over time 
principal and interest are paid monthly on outstanding amounts borrowed 
initially   was borrowed under the term loan component in june  and this amount is being repaid over a five year period 
debt issue costs amounting to  were incurred in connection with the initiation of the agreement and are being amortized over the term of the loan 
in december and june  the company and its commercial lender agreed to revise downward the adjusted net worth covenant to better reflect the company s equity position at that particular time 
in october  this lending institution informed the company that its borrowing availability under its  credit facility had been effectively reduced to zero as a result of a recent appraisal of its fixed assets 
in february  the company and its primary lending institution amended the credit facility 
the amended facility was reduced to a total of  mainly due to the reduction in the appraised valuation of fixed assets that limited the borrowing capacity under the term loan component  as well as to minimize the cost of unused line fees 
certain definitions were also revised which increased the company s available borrowing base 
in addition  the minimum net worth covenant was effectively reduced to approximately  after adjustments for fixed asset impairment charges 
at june   the company was in compliance with this covenant 
the term loan component was revised to an initial  based on the valuation of the company s fixed assets of which  was outstanding on the term loan at june  
the principal associated with the term loan is continuing to be repaid over a year amortization period from the initial date of the credit facility in june the revolving credit component of the overall credit facility comprises the remainder of the total potential borrowing capacity 
there was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of june  if the credit facility  which expires in june  is not extended by agreement of both the company and the lending institution  the remaining principal under the term loan  and any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  would become due at that time 
therefore  the company has reflected its debt associated with this facility as a short term liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the company is unsuccessful in renegotiating this credit facility or is unable to refinance this debt with another lending institution  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial position 
the loans bear interest at prime based or libor based rates  at the discretion of the company 
at june   the rate was 
the company also pays a facility fee on the unused portion of the commitment 
the loan is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and the company is precluded from paying dividends under the terms of the agreement 
the total amount available under the term loan component is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
the company had  outstanding on a letter of credit as of june   supporting the company s  equipment lease 
the company s additional borrowing capacity under the revolver component of the credit facility as of june  was approximately  in march  the company initiated a  lease line of credit with a third party leasing agency 
under this arrangement  the company had various options to acquire manufacturing equipment  including sales leaseback transactions and operating leases 
in october  the company expanded its leasing arrangement with a third party leasing agency 
the revision increased the amount of the lease line from  to  the increase in the line was used to fund capital expansion plans for manufacturing equipment that has allowed increased capacity within the company s primary business unit 
at june   the lease line had been fully utilized 
the company s quarterly lease payment is approximately  in conjunction with this lease  the company is required to maintain a  letter of credit 
the letter of credit was issued by the company s primary lending institution  which diminishes the company s overall borrowing availability under the revolver component of the overall credit facility 
the company is working to see if it can find alternatives to collateralize this letter of credit in order to alleviate this restriction 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this pursuit 
while the company is optimistic about its long term future prospects and growth potential  the timing aspect of near term revenue and profitability is unclear 
the company s future liquidity depends on its ability to successfully generate positive cash flows from operations and to achieve operational savings 
at this time based on the current financial outlook  it appears that the company may not generate the revenues necessary to allow it to continue to meet the current net worth covenant of the credit facility 
to date  the company and its lending institution have maintained a good relationship  and thus the company is optimistic that it will be able to negotiate a further revision of the net worth covenant to better reflect the company s current situation 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in its endeavor to do so  and therefore  this situation could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company raised capital through two private equity transactions 
first  in july  the company completed a  private placement of  shares of its common stock at per share 
in conjunction with the offering  warrants to acquire up to  shares of common stock were granted 
the exercise price of the warrants is per share and the warrants have a five year term 
the second transaction occurred in april  when the company closed on a  private placement consisting of common equity and a  convertible note 
initially   shares were issued 
the note  which was issued to one of the company s directors  will convert automatically into an additional  shares if the company s shareholders vote to approve the conversion of the note into common shares at the company s annual meeting in december if shareholder approval is not obtained  the company is obligated to repay the note on december   with accrued interest at per year 
all shares will be issued at per share 
the company also is continuing to explore other sources of capital  including utilizing its unleveraged assets as collateral for additional borrowing capacity  selling assets that are not core to the company s long term strategic initiatives  and raising equity through a private or public offering 
although the company is confident that it will be successful in arranging adequate financing  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient cash flows to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the course of fiscal therefore  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings  the company is involved in certain environmental matters with respect to its facility in newark  new york 
although the company has reserved for expenses related to this  there can be no assurance that this will be the maximum amount 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
the company typically offers warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a year warranty on its volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
the company provides for a reserve for this potential warranty expense  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event the company s experiences a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that the company s reserves are sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
outlook looking ahead for the full fiscal year of  the company is optimistic about its sales prospects and the status of the manufacturing operations 
at this time  the company expects to achieve revenue growth in a range comparable to the growth rate it achieved during fiscal the company is projecting growth in virtually all major product areas within its business volt  cylindrical and rechargeable 
the growth in each of the quarters  however  is subject to significant fluctuations as the timing of customer orders is not easily predictable 
in particular  volt revenues are dependent upon continued demand from the company s customers  some of which are dependent upon retail sell through 
similarly  revenues from sales of cylindrical products  primarily to military customers  are dependent upon a variety of factors  including the timing of the battery solicitation process within the military  the company s ability to successfully win contract awards  successful qualification of the company s products in the applicable military applications  and the timing of order releases against such contracts 
some of these factors are outside of the company s direct control 
for instance  in june  the company was awarded the top award   of the us army s next gen ii year procurement of small cylindrical batteries 
orders on this contract  though  have yet to begin  and it is difficult to determine when such orders may start 
in july  the company also submitted a proposal on the large cylindrical battery procurement under the next gen ii procurement 
the large rectangular battery solicitation for bids has yet to be issued by the us army 
it is difficult to determine at this time when the us army will issue the solicitations or make any award decisions 
while the company is optimistic about its chances of winning a substantial portion of the contracts with this program  the ultimate outcome is uncertain 
this solicitation process is significantly behind the original schedule mainly as a result of the us government s diversion relating to the terrorist attacks on september  a significant portion of the company s growth projections is dependent upon its success and participation in this next gen ii program 
the company believes that quarterly revenues of approximately  to  will allow it to achieve operating cash breakeven  depending on the company s overall product mix 
the company also believes that quarterly revenues in the range of  should allow the company to be able to report a profit 
while the company has been able to significantly reduce costs during fiscal  it still maintains a fairly substantial fixed cost infrastructure to support its overall operations 
increasing volumes of sales and production will generate very favorable returns to scale  but similarly  decreasing volumes will result in the opposite effect 
in june  the company reported a  impairment charge 
this impairment charge related to a writedown of long lived assets in the company s rechargeable production operations  reflecting a change in the company s strategy 
changes in external economic conditions culminated in june  reflecting a slowdown in the mobile electronics marketplace and a realization that near term business opportunities utilizing the high volume rechargeable production equipment had dissipated 
these changes caused the company to shift away from high volume polymer rechargeable battery production to higher value  lower volume opportunities 
the company s redefined strategy eliminates the need for its high volume production line that had been built mainly to manufacture nokia cell phone replacement batteries 
the new strategy is a three pronged approach 
first  the company will manufacture in house for the higher value  lower volume polymer rechargeable opportunities 
second  the company will utilize its affiliate in taiwan  ultralife taiwan  inc  as a source for both polymer and liquid lithium cells 
third  the company will look to other rechargeable cell manufacturers as sources for cells that the company can then assemble into completed battery packs 
the company is optimistic that this broadened strategy can be a successful  although modest  aspect of its growth for fiscal as a result of the cost savings actions taken during fiscal that significantly impacted the rechargeable segment  and the decline of development efforts related to new cylindrical batteries for military applications as those products move into anticipated volume production  the company expects that its costs related to research and development will decline substantially in fiscal when compared with fiscal the company expects that spending for capital projects in fiscal will be relatively modest 
the company carefully evaluates such projects and will only make capital investments when necessary and when there is typically a very quick payback 
some of the capital equipment acquisitions during the upcoming fiscal year will be financed by the capital equipment grant loan the company recently finalized 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
in the fiscal year beginning july  and is currently evaluating the effect  if any  on the company s financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principle board opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in the fiscal year beginning july  the company does not believe adoption of this pronouncement will have a material adverse effect on its financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in the fiscal year beginning july  the company does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material adverse effect on its financial statements 
risk factors dependence on continued demand for the company s existing products a substantial portion of the company s business depends on the continued demand for products sold by oems using the company s batteries 
therefore  the company s success is substantially dependent upon the success of the oems products in the marketplace 
the company is subject to many risks beyond its control that influence the success or failure of a particular product manufactured by an oem  including competition faced by the oem in its particular industry  market acceptance of the oem s product  the engineering  sales  marketing and management capabilities of the oem  technical challenges unrelated to the company s technology or products faced by the oem in developing its products  and the financial and other resources of the oem 
for instance  in fiscal  of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of its volt batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales to smoke alarm oems in the us if the retail demand for long life smoke detectors decreases significantly  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  in fiscal  of the company s revenues was comprised of sales of cylindrical batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales made directly or indirectly to the us military 
if the demand for cylindrical batteries from the us military were to decrease significantly  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of the company s rechargeable battery business although the company is in production of certain rechargeable cells and batteries  it has not achieved wide market acceptance 
the company cannot assure that volume acceptance of its rechargeable products will occur due to the highly competitive nature of the business 
there are many new company and technology entrants into the marketplace and the company must continually reassess the market segments in which its products can be successful and seek to engage customers in these segments who will adopt the company s products for use in their products 
in addition  these companies must be successful with their products in their markets for the company to gain increased business 
increased competition  failure to gain customer acceptance of products or failure of the company s customers in their markets could have a further adverse affect on the company s rechargeable battery business 
risks relating to growth and expansion rapid growth of the company s battery business could significantly strain management  operations and technical resources 
if the company is successful in obtaining rapid market growth of its batteries  the company will be required to deliver large volumes of quality products to customers on a timely basis at a reasonable cost to those customers 
for example  significantly large orders from the us military for the company s cylindrical products may strain the current capacity capabilities of the company and would require time to install additional equipment and build a sufficient support infrastructure 
the company cannot assure  however  that business will rapidly grow or that its efforts to expand manufacturing and quality control activities will be successful or that the company will be able to satisfy commercial scale production requirements on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company will also be required to continue to improve its operations  management and financial systems and controls 
the failure to manage growth effectively could have an adverse effect on business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on us military procurement of batteries the company will continue to develop both primary and rechargeable battery products to meet the needs of the us military forces 
the company believes it has a high probability for success in solicitations for these batteries 
any delay of solicitations by  or failure of  the us government to purchase batteries manufactured by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to competition and technological obsolescence the company also competes with large and small manufacturers of alkaline  carbon zinc  seawater  high rate and primary batteries as well as other manufacturers of lithium batteries 
the company cannot assure that it will successfully compete with these manufacturers  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  distribution  marketing  sales and other resources 
the market for the company s products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards  often resulting in product obsolescence or short product lifecycles 
although the company believes that its batteries  particularly the volt and advanced rechargeable batteries  are comprised of state of the art technology  there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop technologies or products that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or less marketable 
primary batteries the primary non rechargeable battery industry is characterized by intense competition with a number of companies offering or seeking to develop products similar to the company s 
the company is subject to competition from manufacturers of primary batteries  such as carbon zinc  alkaline and lithium batteries in various configurations  including volt  aaa  aa  c  d  a and other cell sizes 
manufacturers of primary batteries include the gillette company duracell  energizer holdings  inc  rayovac corp  sanyo electric co 
ltd  sony corp  and matsushita electric industrial co  ltd 
panasonic 
manufacturers of specialty lithium batteries include saft  eagle picher industries and friwo silberkraft gmbh 
many of these companies have substantially greater resources than the company  and some have the capacity and volume of business to be able to produce their products more efficiently than the company at the present time 
in addition  these companies are developing batteries using a variety of battery technologies and chemistries that are expected to compete with the company s technology 
if these companies successfully market their batteries before the introduction of the company s products  there could be a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
rechargeable batteries the rechargeable battery industry is also characterized by intense competition with a large number of companies offering or seeking to develop technology and products similar to the company s 
the company is subject to competition from manufacturers of traditional rechargeable batteries  such as nickel cadmium batteries  from manufacturers of rechargeable batteries of more recent technologies  such as nickel metal hydride  lithium ion liquid electrolyte and lithium polymer batteries  as well as from companies engaged in the development of batteries incorporating new technologies 
manufacturers of nickel cadmium and or nickel metal hydride batteries include sanyo electric co 
ltd  sony corp  toshiba corp  saft and matsushita electric industrial co  ltd 
panasonic  among others 
manufacturers of lithium ion liquid electrolyte batteries currently include saft soc des acc  sony corp  toshiba corp  matsushita electric industrial co  ltd  sanyo electric co 
ltd  sony corp  e one moli energy ltd  byd co 
ltd  samsung sdi co  ltd  shenzhen b k electronic co

manufacturers of lithium polymer batteries currently include valence technology  inc  sony corp  amperex technology ltd  danionics a s  finecell co 
ltd  lg chemical  ltd  skc  samsung sdi co  ltd  ultralife taiwan  inc  and kokam engineering co  ltd 
many companies with substantially greater resources are developing a variety of battery technologies  including liquid electrolyte lithium and solid electrolyte lithium batteries  which are expected to compete with the company s technology 
other companies undertaking research and development activities of solid polymer batteries have already developed prototypes and are constructing commercial scale production facilities 
if these companies successfully market their batteries before the introduction of the company s products  there could be a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel because of the specialized  technical nature of the business  the company is highly dependent on certain members of management  marketing  engineering and technical staff 
the loss of these services or these members  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to developing manufacturing capacity to produce high volumes of our advanced rechargeable batteries  the company must attract  recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees 
the company s ability to pursue effectively its business strategy will depend upon  among other factors  the successful recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced managerial  marketing  engineering and technical personnel 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to retain or recruit this type of personnel 
safety risks  demands of environmental and other regulatory compliance due to the high energy density inherent in lithium batteries  the company s batteries can pose safety certain risks  including the risk of fire 
although the company incorporates safety procedures in research  development and manufacturing processes that are designed to minimize safety risks  the company cannot assure that accidents will not occur 
although the company currently carries insurance policies which cover loss of the plant and machinery  leasehold improvements  inventory and business interruption  any accident  whether at the manufacturing facilities or from the use of the products  may result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries 
these types of losses could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
national  state and local laws impose various environmental controls on the manufacture  storage  use and disposal of lithium batteries and or of certain chemicals used in the manufacture of lithium batteries 
although the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations and that  except as noted below  there are no environmental conditions that will require material expenditures for clean up at the present or former facilities or at facilities to which it has sent waste for disposal  there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on the company or otherwise subject it to future liabilities 
moreover  state and local governments may enact additional restrictions relating to the disposal of lithium batteries used by customers which could have a material adverse effect on business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the us department of transportation and certain foreign regulatory agencies that consider lithium to be a hazardous material regulate the transportation of batteries which contain lithium metal 
the company currently ships lithium batteries in accordance with regulations established by the us department of transportation 
there can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture  transportation  storage  use and disposal of materials used to manufacture our batteries or restricting disposal of batteries will not be imposed or how these regulations will affect the company or its customers 
in connection with our purchase lease of the newark  new york facility in  a consulting firm performed a phase i and ii environmental site assessment which revealed the existence of contaminated soil and ground water around one of the buildings 
the company retained an engineering firm which estimated that the cost of remediation should be in the range of  this cost  however  is merely an estimate and the cost may in fact be much higher 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with a third party which provides that the company and this third party will retain an environmental consulting firm to conduct a supplemental phase ii investigation to verify the existence of the contaminants and further delineate the nature of the environmental concern 
the third party agreed to reimburse the company for fifty percent of the cost of correcting the environmental concern on the newark property 
the company has fully reserved for its portion of the estimated liability 
test sampling was completed in the spring of the next step is for the company to submit a remediation plan for approval 
upon approval  the company would have the authority to remediate the property 
because this is a voluntary remediation  there is no requirement for the company to complete the project within any specific time frame 
the company cannot assure that it will not face claims resulting in substantial liability which would have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations in the period in which such claims are resolved 
limited sources of supply certain materials used in products are available only from a single or a limited number of suppliers 
additionally  the company may elect to develop relationships with a single or limited number of suppliers for materials that are otherwise generally available 
although the company believes that alternative suppliers are available to supply materials that could replace materials currently used and that  if necessary  the company would be able to redesign its products to make use of such alternatives  any interruption in the supply from any supplier that serves as a sole source could delay product shipments and have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company has experienced interruptions of product deliveries by sole source suppliers  these interruptions have not had a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company cannot guarantee that it will not experience a material interruption of product deliveries from sole source suppliers 
dependence on proprietary technologies the company s success depends more on the knowledge  ability  experience and technological expertise of its employees than on the legal protection of patents and other proprietary rights 
the company claims proprietary rights in various unpatented technologies  know how  trade secrets and trademarks relating to products and manufacturing processes 
the company cannot guarantee the degree of protection these various claims may or will afford  or that competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
the company protects its proprietary rights in its products and operations through contractual obligations  including nondisclosure agreements with certain employees  customers  consultants and strategic partners 
there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection these contractual measures may or will afford 
the company  however  has had patents issued and patent applications pending in the us and elsewhere 
the company cannot assure i that patents will be issued from any pending applications  or that the claims allowed under any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology  ii that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or iii as to the degree or adequacy of protection any patents or patent applications may or will afford 
if the company is found to be infringing third party patents  there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain licenses with respect to such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses could delay product shipment or the introduction of new products  and costly attempts to design around such patents could foreclose the development  manufacture or sale of products 
dependence on technology transfer agreements the company s research and development of advanced rechargeable battery technology and products utilizes internally developed technology  acquired technology and certain patents and related technology licensed by the company pursuant to non exclusive  technology transfer agreements 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop  independently or through the use of similar technology transfer agreements  rechargeable battery technology or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies and products currently under research and development 
risks related to china joint venture program in july  the company entered into several agreements related to the establishment of a manufacturing facility in changzhou  china  for the production and distribution in and from china of a lithium primary batteries 
changzhou ultra power battery co  ltd  a company organized in china china battery  purchased certain technology  equipment  training and consulting services relating to the design and operation of a lithium battery manufacturing plant 
china battery was required to pay approximately million to the company over the first two years of the agreement  of which approximately million has been paid 
the company has been attempting to collect the balance due under this contract 
china battery has indicated that it will not make these payments until certain contractual issues have been resolved 
due to china battery s questionable willingness to pay  the company wrote off in fiscal the entire balance owed as well as its investment aggregating  since china battery has not purchased technology  equipment  training or consulting services to produce batteries other than a lithium batteries  the company does not believe that china battery has the capacity to become a competitor 
the company does not anticipate that the manufacturing or marketing of a lithium batteries will be a substantial portion of its product line in the future 
however  in december  china battery sent a letter demanding reimbursement of an unspecified amount of losses they have incurred plus a refund for certain equipment that was sold to china battery 
the company has attempted to initiate negotiations to resolve the dispute 
however  an agreement has not yet been reached 
although china battery has not taken any additional steps  there can be no assurance that china battery will not further pursue such a claim which  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that such a claim is without merit 
ability to insure against losses because certain of the company s primary batteries are used in a variety of security and safety products and medical devices  it may be exposed to liability claims if such a battery fails to function properly 
the company maintains what it believes to be sufficient liability insurance coverage to protect against potential claims  however  there can be no assurance that the liability insurance will continue to be available  or that any such liability insurance would be sufficient to cover any claim or claims 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and possible volatility of stock price the company s future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as the timing and shipment of significant orders  new product introductions  delays in customer releases of purchase orders  the mix of distribution channels through which the company sells its products and general economic conditions 
frequently  a substantial portion of the company s revenues in each quarter is generated from orders booked and shipped during that quarter 
as a result  revenue levels are difficult to predict for each quarter 
if revenue results are below expectations  operating results will be adversely affected as the company has a sizeable base of fixed overhead costs that do not vary much with the changes in revenue 
in addition to the uncertainties of quarterly operating results  future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  including technological innovations or commercial products  litigation or public concerns as to the safety or commercial value of one or more of its products  may cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate substantially for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
risks related to product warranty claims the company typically offers warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a year warranty on its volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
the company provides for a reserve for this potential warranty expense  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event the company s experiences a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that the company s reserves are sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to company s ability to finance ongoing operations and projected growth while the company believes that it revenue growth projections and its ongoing cost controls will allow it to generate cash and achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  there is no assurance as to when or if the company will be able to achieve its projections 
the company s future cash flows from operations  combined with its accessibility to cash and credit  may not be sufficient to allow the company to finance ongoing operations or to make required investments for future growth 
the company may need to seek additional credit or access capital markets for additional funds 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in this regard 
risks related to maintaining debt obligations the company has certain debt covenants that must be maintained  most notably a requirement with its primary lending institution to meet certain levels of net worth 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to meet these debt covenants in the future 
if the company defaults on any of its debt covenants and it is unable to renegotiate credit terms in order to comply with such covenants  this could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
in june  the company s credit facility with its primary lending institution is scheduled to expire 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in refinancing this credit facility 
risks related to arthur andersen llp being our past auditors there may be no effective remedy against arthur andersen llp in connection with a material misstatement or omission in the financial statements audited by them  due to the fact that arthur andersen llp was convicted on june  of federal obstruction of justice arising from the government s investigation of enron corp 
arthur andersen llp consented to the inclusion of their report in the annual reports and registration statements we filed prior to june  our inability to include in future registration statements or reports financial statements for one or more years audited by arthur andersen llp or to obtain arthur andersen llp s consent to the inclusion of their report on our and financial statements may impede our access to the capital markets 
should we seek to access the public capital markets  securities and exchange commission sec rules will require us to include or incorporate by reference in any prospectus three years of audited financial statements 
until our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending june  become available  the sec s current rules would require us to present audited financial statements for one or more fiscal years audited by arthur andersen llp 
prior to that time  the sec may cease accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen llp  in which case we would be unable to access the public capital markets unless pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our current independent accounting firm  or another independent accounting firm  is able to audit the financial statements originally audited by arthur andersen llp 
in addition  as a result of the departure of our former engagement team leaders  arthur andersen llp is no longer in a position to consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference in any prospectus of their report on our audited financial statements for the years ended june  and june   and investors in any subsequent offerings for which we use their audit report will not be entitled to recovery against them under section of the securities act of for any material misstatements or omissions in those financial statements 
consequently  our financing costs may increase or we may miss attractive market opportunities if either our annual financial statements for and audited by arthur andersen llp should cease to satisfy the sec s requirements or those statements are used in a prospectus but investors are not entitled to recovery against our auditors for material misstatements or omissions in them
