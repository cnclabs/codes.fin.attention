critical accounting policies and estimates pioneer standard s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported pioneer standard electronics  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of pioneer standard s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates and returns 
a reserve is provided for product returns based on the company s historical experience 
a portion of products sold are estimated to be returned due to reasons such as product failure and excess inventory stocked by the customer  which subject to certain terms and conditions  the company will agree to accept 
the company records estimated reductions to revenues at the time of sale based on this historical experience 
if future trends were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions to revenues may result based on this new experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and obtains credit insurance in certain circumstances to protect its interests 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market  net of related reserves 
the company s inventory is constantly monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection  stock rotation right of return status  and technical obsolescence  as well as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are pioneer standard electronics  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
investments 
the company holds marketable equity securities that are carried at fair value 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed other than temporary 
management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of the market decline and the financial condition of and specific prospects of the issuer 
pioneer standard also evaluates available information such as published financial reports and market research and analyzes cyclical trends within the industry segments in which the various companies operate to determine whether market declines should be considered other than temporary 
deferred taxes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
the company presently records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies 
the company is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business 
the company provides for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments 
restructuring and other special charges 
the company has recorded a reserve in connection with restructuring its business 
this reserve principally includes estimates related to employee separation costs  the consolidation of facilities  contractual obligations  and the valuation of inventories 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
intangible and long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets

more than of the decline in consolidated net sales for the year was attributable to ied as a result of the downturn in the electronic components market 
fiscal ied net sales decreased from fiscal compared with an increase in sales of in over the decline in ied sales was a result of significant volume declines and lower average selling prices and can be attributed to the most severe downturn ever experienced in the pioneer standard electronics  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents electronic component industry  caused by excess inventory throughout the supply chain and the lower level of end user demand in the markets the company serves 
sales increased in as a result of record growth in the electronic components markets fueled by the strong end user demand in the communications and internet markets  which began in fiscal the increase was offset by a dramatic reduction in sales growth in the last half of  caused by the beginning of an industry wide market slowdown 
looking forward  the company is confident the markets will return  but with the lack of visibility regarding the timing of any meaningful recovery  the company is anticipating another difficult year 
fiscal csd net sales decreased from and increased in compared with the weak us economy  manifested by a slowdown in information technology spending  has been the primary factor in the decrease in net sales compared with the increase in sales compared with was the result of strong demand for mid range servers  storage products and software throughout even though the challenging sales environment is expected to continue  csd will continue to benefit from the broad diversification of the customers it serves  as well as its concentration in the mid to large sized customer segment 
gross margin consolidated gross margin decreased to for from in a portion of this decrease   is due to an inventory adjustment associated with the closing of an ied business line as part of the fourth quarter restructuring  discussed below  combined with other inventory adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory  including inventory associated with terminated supplier and customer relationships 
the decrease excluding the effect of the inventory adjustments is attributable to the shift in the divisional sales mix and reduced sales volume along with lower average selling prices affecting ied 
management anticipates that the reduction in gross margins is temporary and margins will recover when the market returns to normal levels 
consolidated gross margin for was compared with in despite the pricing pressures experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  ied had an overall increase in gross margin for primarily attributable to higher average selling prices and long lead times experienced during the first eight months of the fiscal year as a result of the demand for certain products 
this gross margin improvement was more than offset by the sales mix caused by a higher proportion of the computer system division s sales of relatively lower margin products 
operating costs warehouse  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in operating expense can primarily be attributed to the expense reduction initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the third quarter of fiscal in order to improve operating margins in this difficult sales environment 
however  due to the significant volume declines in sales  operating costs as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal pioneer standard electronics  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents  up from for the prior year 
the overall dollar decrease in operating expenses can be specifically attributed to lower compensation and benefits due to personnel reductions and lower incentives associated with current financial performance  combined with the reduction in discretionary spending demonstrated through decreased advertising and promotion expense  travel and entertainment expense  communications expense and contract labor 
the overall decrease in operating expenses was slightly offset by an increase in bad debt expense and additional expenses related to the company s start up software businesses 
the company s bad debt expense increased million from fiscal this increase is the result of additional reserve requirements at ied and csd for accounts that filed for chapter bankruptcy protection as a result of the economic downturn  an increase to the reserve for accounts denied credit insurance  and the prolonged weakness in the technology marketplace 
the improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales when comparing and is the result of leveraging expenses on higher sales volume  coupled with the effects of implementing cost control initiatives 
the overall dollar increase in operating expenses between fiscal and fiscal was the result of higher compensation and fringes attributable to favorable operating results  an increase in outside services  repairs and maintenance expense and bad debt expense  offset by a decrease in contract labor costs 
special charges beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company took a number of significant actions  including reductions in its workforce  salary freezes and furloughs  cutbacks in discretionary spending  deferral of non strategic projects  and other cost containment and cost reduction actions  to mitigate  in part  the impact of significantly reduced revenues 
due to the duration of the severe downturn in the electronic components market  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management committed to a restructuring plan for certain corporate and ied operations 
as a result of this action  the company recognized a restructuring charge and other special charges totaling approximately million  pre tax  of which million is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations and million is classified in the fiscal consolidated statement of operations as restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge includes million related to qualifying exit costs for one service center and eleven regional office facilities and million related to severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately personnel 
the company estimates annual pre tax cost savings beginning in fiscal of approximately million 
these estimates of future costs and benefits are subject to change during the execution of the restructuring plan 
as of march   no payments had been made for any of these expenses 
in addition to costs associated with personnel reductions and the consolidation of certain facilities  the special charges included provisions related to inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory primarily associated with the company s decision  as part of the restructuring plan  to close its electronics manufacturing resources and services facility and to terminate certain supplier and customer relationships

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million pre tax charge for a non cash write down for the abandonment of certain it system assets 
corporate and other the operating loss for the corporate and other segment was million for fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an improvement of million 
the improvement is primarily the result of the million write down of it system assets recognized in the prior year  that did not recur in fiscal this improvement was offset by an increase in expenses between years predominantly associated with operating losses recognized for the company s software businesses and the corporate portion of the restructuring charge  as well as an increase in other professional expenses 
the operating loss for corporate and other increased in fiscal from fiscal due to the million write down of it system assets during the fourth quarter and an overall increase in compensation attributable to increased head count and normal inflationary increases 
other income expense  interest expense and income taxes dollars in thousands other income gain on sale of assets interest expense effective tax rate other income in primarily consisted of million of equity and dividend income earned from the company s investments in affiliates  combined with million of foreign currency exchange gains and other income 
this income was offset by million of other expense consisting of an investment write off of million and a charge of million recognized when the company reclassified million from the accumulated other comprehensive income loss section of equity into earnings to realize the deferred loss from a previously effective interest rate hedge  which became ineffective during the year 
other income in consisted of foreign currency exchange losses of million offset by million of equity and dividend income earned from investments in affiliates  while other income in consisted of foreign currency gains of million and dividend income of million 
in addition  in fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million related to the sale and disposal of assets no longer required in the business 
interest expense decreased million in compared with this decrease resulted from reduced levels of debt  lower interest rates resulting from the accounts receivable securitization financing the company completed in october  and favorable overall market interest rates 
the increased interest expense in over is primarily attributable to higher average levels of outstanding borrowings on the company s revolving credit agreement  as well as an increase in the effective borrowing rates 
average outstanding borrowings increased in order to fund working capital pioneer standard electronics  inc

table of contents needs and capital expenditures needed to support the ongoing growth of the business 
in addition  interest expense increased in due to a increase in the interest rate on the company s public debt 
the effective tax rate for was compared with in and was primarily the result of the utilization of previously reserved tax loss carryforwards 
when comparing to  the effective tax rate decrease was due to the change in the valuation allowance associated with the operating loss carryforwards from the company s canadian subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase can primarily be attributed to the reduction in inventories combined with the decline in accounts receivable  offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
in fiscal  million of cash provided by operations related to cash provided for working capital items 
overall  current assets  including cash and cash equivalents  decreased by million and current liabilities decreased million  resulting in a net working capital decrease of million in compared with these results are attributable to the fact that the company is working capital intensive and  therefore  generates cash during periods of contraction and utilizes cash during periods of expansion 
the decrease generated in cash provided by operating activities when comparing fiscal with fiscal is the result of the strong sales environment in and thus the trends seen when comparing these years is opposite of the trends seen in fiscal  as explained by the company s utilization of working capital 
the decrease in current assets in fiscal is a result of lower levels of business activity and the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory 
the inventory decrease of million is attributed to management s continued efforts to reduce the high levels of inventory on hand  which had been created from the backlogs that were experienced during the peak sales periods in fiscal accounts receivable decreased due to reduced sales during march compared with sales in march  combined with an increased allowance in doubtful accounts to respond to higher levels of credit risk resulting from the current economic environment 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable attributable to reduced purchases of inventory as a result of lower sales in the fiscal year combined with the focus on managing down inventory levels
