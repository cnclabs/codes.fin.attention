net sales gross margin ebitda pressure vessels and springs   cylinders   metals totals   the increase in pressure vessel sales in compared to was due to a strong order levels in that product line towards the end of  the backlog for which at the end of was million higher than at the end of  and the recognition of million of revenues on a large nasa contract shipped in the first quarter of gross margin has been affected by a change in product mix towards lower margin domestic products  an increase in unfavorable variances in the fourth quarter of due to decrease in production activity as the result of a lower order levels towards the end of and provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories of million in the fourth quarter of also  sales of leaf springs in continued to be impacted by the economic downturn as consumers decreased spending on recreational items  particularly in the marine market 

management anticipates that these trends will continue into 
sales of cylinders continues to be affected by a downturn in this market  
a trend which the company believes will continue into 
gross margin has been affected accordingly as the decreased volume has significantly impact this segment s ability to absorb costs 
gross margin has also been impacted by provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories of million in the fourth quarter of management evaluates the company s segments based on ebitda  a measure of cash generation  and is presented  not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt and due to the close relationship it bears to reunion s financial covenants in its borrowing agreements 
ebitda and ebitda as a percentage of sales decreased significantly during compared to the pro forma primarily due to the same factors affecting gross profit margin discussed above 
plastics plastics sales for totaled million  compared to million in year to date plastics sales included million from its former irish plastics subsidiary which the company sold in the third quarter but excluded million of sales from the pre march  merger period 
on a proforma basis assuming these events occurred at the beginning of  plastics sales would have been million  indicating a million decrease year to year 
this decrease in revenues is the continuation during of a downward trend which began in and resulted from several factors  including certain customers relocating manufacturing operations to mexico and asia  reduced customer orders for continuing programs  end of product cycles and delays in new program starts  which affected all plastics facilities 

management is seeking to expand plastics product offerings in the business machines  consumer products and medical products industries to mitigate this trend 
however  if not successful  this trend in plastics revenue could continue into 
plastics gross profit for was million  or  compared to million  or  for on a proforma basis for the events described above plastics gross profit and margin would be million  or 
the decrease in gross profit and margin is directly related to the decreasing trend in sales  resulting in inefficiencies and the inability to absorb fixed overheads

selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sga expenses for were million  compared to million for had the merger  the acquisition of npsac and the sale of the company s irish plastics business occurred at the beginning of  sga for would have been million  indicating a pro forma decrease of million 
this decrease in sga is directly related to the decreasing trend in sales  resulting in lower commissions expense  and cost cutting measures taken during june  which included personnel reductions in sales and administration 
the cost of these reductions was inconsequential as the company paid no severance packages and retained no post severance obligations related to these reductions 

management estimates the savings from these reductions to be approximately million annually 
however  the benefits of these cost cutting measures are being offset by the continuation of the negative trend in sales and the resulting effect on the company s ability to absorb costs 
sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for compared to on a proforma basis in sga as a percentage of sales was higher in compared to due to the faster rate at which volume has decreased compared to decreases in relatively fixed administrative costs

management of the company has been in contact with certain of the note holders and holders representing approximately ninety percent of the principal amount of senior notes outstanding 
as part of its corporate wide restructuring plan  management of the company has determined to dispose of assets in order to meet its interest payment obligations under the senior notes

factors affecting current and future liquidity during the third and fourth quarters of  the company experienced downturns in several of the markets it serves resulting in a decrease in the company s ability to absorb costs and a decrease in the quality of its borrowing base due to an increase in ineligible receivables and inventory 
based on the borrowing base formulas as set forth in the boa financing and security agreement  this increase in ineligibles resulted in a decrease in borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility 
these events have had a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its obligations  including the company extending its vendors and its inability to make the november  million semi annual interest payment on the million of outstanding senior notes 
management of the company has developed a restructuring plan which includes the disposition of other businesses and which is designed to improve productivity and operating performance 

the improvements in productivity and operating performance as the result of its implementation  although expected to begin in  may not materialize for several quarters 
and the company has not executed a significant sale of assets 
at the same time  the company has past due  immediate and near term obligations 

management of the company is currently pursuing certain asset dispositions included in the company s restructuring plan and believes that by the end of june  based on recent discussions with several qualified buyers  the company will generate adequate proceeds from asset sales to alleviate the current and future strain on liquidity and meet its past due  immediate and near term obligations 
however  no assurances can be given that such pursuits will be successful 
going concern as of december   the company was unable to extend its may sinking fund payment date and was unable to fund its november  million semi annual interest payment on its senior notes as it had insufficient funds under its revolving credit facility 
additionally  the company s bank of america boa or bank of america financing and security agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain various covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain minimum availability and specify that the company meet certain financial requirements  including minimum ebitda  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with the minimum ebitda requirement  fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio 
the company has not been in compliance with certain of these financial covenants since the third quarter of fiscal as a result  million of the company s long term debt was classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and is currently subject to various remedies including  but not limited to  acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the boa financing and security agreement and the senior notes 

the company is projecting that it will not be in compliance with the covenants of its boa financing and security agreement or its senior notes over the next twelve months 
the company has generated a net loss of  during the year ended december  the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the negative working capital position of  the defaults of the boa financing and security agreement and the senior notes  and the lack of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility indicate that 
the company may not be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
since september  the company has been negotiating with its lenders to defer principal payments and modify the financial covenants under its existing debt facilities 
additionally  the company has engaged a firm to serve as its investment banker with respect to the sale of its materials handling systems business and has had discussions with several prospective buyers 
the company plans to continue to pursue this sale to provide the liquidity necessary to maintain its ongoing operations 

although management expects to be able to accomplish its plans  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
failure to accomplish these plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity  financial position and future operations 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstances 
application of the accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties and that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses which in the normal course of business are subsequently adjusted to actual results 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts sales are recorded when title and risks of ownership transfer to the buyer 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recorded as revenues and the related costs are recorded as cost of sales 
the company markets its products to a diverse customer base in the united states and in other countries 
credit is extended after a credit review by management which is based on a customer s ability to perform its obligations 
such reviews are regularly updated 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon agings of customer balances and specific account reviews by management 
reunion industries has no concentration of credit risks and generally does not require collateral or other security from its customers 
accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december   which represented and  respectively  of gross trade receivables excluding other non trade receivables 
inventories and inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  at costs which approximate the last in  first out method of inventory valuation 
the remainder are at costs which approximate the first in  first out method 
work in process and finished goods include material costs  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
reserves for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on reviews of inventory usage reports for items more than one year old 
the company evaluates its inventories on a quarterly basis to identify excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories and assess reserve adequacy 
when this evaluation indicates such inventories exist  the reserve is increased by a charge to operations or such inventories are written off 
with downturns in certain of the markets served by the company during the second half of  the company experienced an increase in inventories classified as slow moving according to its policy 
based on a review by management  the company wrote off million of inventories in the fourth quarter of goodwill and impairment the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses is considered to be goodwill and  until december   was being amortized over years using the straight line method 
the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the goodwill s remaining estimated useful life is used 
if this analysis indicates that goodwill is impaired  a loss is recognized to reduce its carrying value to fair market value 
at december   the company had million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet and another million was classified within net assets of discontinued operations 
of the million of goodwill  million relates to the company s pressure vessel and springs segment  million relates to the cylinders segment and the remainder relates to additional shares of the company s common stock issued pursuant to the merger agreement 
see additional shares of reunion common stock 
because of the historically positive operating results and cash generation of the pressure vessel and springs segment  management does not consider its related goodwill to be impaired as of december  also  management does not consider the cylinders segment goodwill to be impaired as the company believes this segment is in a temporary cyclical downturn 
during the fourth quarter of  as part of the provision for restructuring  the company wrote off all goodwill related to plastics of million due to the equipment write offs and the historical operating results of that segment 
management does not consider the million of goodwill classified within net assets of discontinued operations to be impaired as it relates to the discontinued materials handling systems operations  which has historically produced positive operating results and cash generation and which management expects to dispose of at an amount which exceeds its carrying value 
see recent accounting pronouncements 
property  plant and equipment the company evaluates its property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
with downturns in certain of the markets served by the company during the second half of  indications were that impairment existed in its plastics segment and that the carrying value of a portion of its property  plant and equipment was no longer recoverable 
as a result  as part of the provision for restructuring  the company recorded million related to impaired property  plant and equipment at plastics 
such equipment has a carrying value at december  of approximately million representing the appraised estimated liquidation value of such equipment 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the company makes contributions to the defined benefit plans based on the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the company uses the fair value of plan assets to determine the expected and actual returns on plan assets 
the difference between the expected return and actual return is deferred 
during the second half of  the fair value of assets in both of the company s defined benefit pension plans decreased for various reasons  including a downturn in the overall economy and unusual world events 
this decrease in asset values resulted in the company recording additional minimum pension liabilities in excess of amounts previously accruedtotalling million which is classified as accumulated comprehensive loss within stockholders equity at december  although management believes the long term rates of return used to calculate the expected returns on plan assets are reasonable  should a trend of actual returns being less than expected returns develop  future pension costs would likely increase 
in determining the discount rates to be used at the end of each year to determine plan liabilities  the company looks at rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
changes in discount rates over the last three years have not materially affected pension costs and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas 
the company currently expects that consolidated pension costs for will not be significantly different from 
other postretirement benefits the company provides health benefits for certain retired employees at the company s pressure vessel operations and plastics and of its corporate executive payroll 
these plans are not funded 
other postretirement benefit costs and the benefit obligation are actuarially determined based on discount rates and expected trends in healthcare costs
