item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we operate in an industry sector where stock values are highly volatile and may be influenced by economic and other factors beyond our control 
we believe that our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors 
see additional discussion contained in risk factors set forth in part i  item of this annual report on form k for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference into this part ii  item statements in this discussion and analysis include forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
our actual results in future periods may be significantly different from any future performance suggested in this report 
risks and uncertainties that may affect our results may include  among others factors that may affect future operating results the current economic downturn  cyclical nature of both the semiconductor and san systems industries and the markets addressed by our products  availability and extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  price erosion  competitive factors  timing of new product introductions  changes in product mix  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  product obsolescence  business and product market cycles  economic and technological risks associated with our acquisition and alliance activities  and the ability to develop and implement new technologies 
our operating results could also be impacted by sudden fluctuations in customer requirements  currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business 
we operate in a technologically advanced  rapidly changing and highly competitive environment 
we predominantly sell custom products to customers operating in a similar environment 
accordingly  changes in the conditions of any of our customers may have a greater impact on our operating results and financial condition than if we predominantly offered standard products that could be sold to many purchasers 
while we cannot predict what effect these various factors may have on our financial results  the aggregate effect of these and other factors could result in significant volatility in our future performance 
to the extent our performance may not meet expectations published by external sources  public reaction could result in a sudden and significantly adverse impact on the market price of our securities  particularly on a short term basis 
we have international subsidiaries and distributors that operate and sell our products globally 
further  we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and manufacturing equipment from foreign suppliers and incur labor and other operating costs in foreign currencies  particularly in our japanese manufacturing facilities 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 
we utilize forward exchange and purchased currency option contracts to manage our exposure associated with net asset and liability positions and cash flows denominated in non functional currencies 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  hereafter referred to as the notes 
there is no assurance that these hedging transactions will eliminate exposure to currency rate fluctuations that could affect our operating results 
our corporate headquarters and some of our manufacturing facilities are located near major earthquake faults 
as a result  in the event of a major earthquake  we could suffer damages that could significantly and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
where more than one significant factor contributed to changes in results from year to year  we have quantified material factors throughout the md a where practicable 
while management believes that the discussion and analysis in this report is adequate for a fair presentation of the information  we recommend that you read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the remainder of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes describes the significant accounting policies essential to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
inventory reserves 
we establish reserves for estimated excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about demand and market conditions generally over the following months 
we operate in a volatile industry sector characterized by rapid changes in technology and market conditions 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we operate our own wafer fabrication facilities and make significant capital expenditures to ensure that we are technologically competitive 
in addition  we have actively pursued the acquisition of businesses which have resulted in significant goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors which we consider could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset  or iv a significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that there is an indicator that the carrying value of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure impairment based on estimates of future cash flow 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions within the company and the industry 
restructuring reserves 
we have recorded reserves for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring costs include payments to employees for severance  lease and contract termination fees  decommissioning costs for fabrication equipment  and other costs to close facilities 
the reserves are recorded at the time we announce a plan to exit certain activities and are based on estimates of the costs and length of time to exit those activities 
income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
overview revenues decreased to billion in from billion in the decrease was primarily the result of decreased demand  most notably for products used in broadband access  networking infrastructure  storage infrastructure applications  and storage area network san systems  reflecting the economic downturn in the industry 
the decline in revenues was partially offset by the additional revenues from acquisitions of c cube microsystems  inc c cube and the raid division of american megatrends  inc 
ami in gross profit margin decreased to in from in primarily as a result of decreased revenue for higher margin products  higher manufacturing variances and period costs as a percentage of revenues and additional excess inventory and related charges of million for as compared to million in the decrease in gross profit margin was offset in part by cost saving measures undertaken during discussed further in note of the notes 
operating expenses increased to billion in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the operating expenses of c cube and ami  a million charge for restructuring and other non recurring items  net  and other acquisition related charges of million for in process research and development ipr d  million for amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation and million in amortization of intangibles 
see notes and of the notes 
research and development r d costs increased by million in due to additional costs incurred in connection with acquisitions in and continued core business spending  which was offset in part by cost saving measures undertaken during the year 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs remained relatively flat from year to year 
incremental  post acquisition sg a expenses of c cube and ami were largely offset by cost saving measures undertaken during the year 
for the years ended december  and  gains on sale of investments in equity securities were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  compared to net income for the same period in of million  or income per diluted share 
a further discussion on results of operations is covered below 
cash and short term investments decreased by to billion as of december  from billion as of december  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower cash flows from our continuing operations 
some of the major transactions that impacted cash and short term investments during the year were as follows payments for acquisitions made in in the third quarter of  we amended the master lease and security agreements entered into in april and march see note of the notes 
pursuant to the amendments  we participated as a debt holder in the lease transactions replacing some of the existing banks 
as of december   our debt contribution of million was recorded as non current assets on the balance sheet 
we cash collateralized million of the remaining debt and equity investments of the lessors 
this was also recorded as non current assets and deposits 
on october   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due in  increasing our long term liabilities to billion at december  from million at december  see note of the notes 
our significant cash position provides us with the capital to make strategic acquisitions and to continue investing in key technologies 
stock split 
on january   we announced a two for one common stock split  which was declared by the board of directors as a stock dividend payable to stockholders of record on february  as one new share of common stock for each share held on that date 
the newly issued common stock shares were distributed on february  in the following discussion and analysis  stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the two for one common stock split announced on january  for all periods presented by reclassifying the par value of the newly issued shares arising from the split from additional paid in capital to common stock 
in addition  all references in the financial statements to number of shares  per share amounts  stock option data and market prices of our common stock have been restated 
acquisitions and other major transactions 
we are continually exploring strategic acquisitions that build upon our existing library of intellectual property and increase our leadership position in the markets where we operate 
during  we acquired c cube microsystems inc and certain tangible and intangible assets associated with the redundant array of independent disks  or raid  business of american megatrends  inc the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and  accordingly  the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements as of the effective date of each acquisition through the end of the period 
the acquisitions are summarized below 
see note of the notes 
acquisition purchase identified deferred company date price consideration ipr d goodwill intangibles compensation amounts in millions c cube may million shares  million options  million warrants raid division of ami august cash million restricted shares on april   we announced a co development and foundry supply agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 
tsmc 
this agreement is part of our strategy to outsource  that is to procure a larger portion of our wafer requirements from external sources 
as a result of our joint development efforts with tsmc we anticipate purchasing  consistent with our outsourcing strategy  such portion of our wafer volume requirements based on the micron process technology that we do not manufacture ourselves 
in addition  we anticipate being able to defer the need to expand our manufacturing capacity for the micron technology beyond the time when products designed for that technology would begin volume production 
we also anticipate collaborating with tsmc on further advancement in wafer fabrication technology 
during  we acquired a division of neomagic corporation neomagic  a division of cacheware  inc cacheware  intraserver technology  inc 
intraserver  datapath systems  inc datapath  paravoice technologies  inc paravoice and syntax systems  inc 
syntax 
the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and accordingly  the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements as of the effective date of each acquisition through the end of the period 
these transactions are summarized below 
there were no significant differences between the accounting policies of lsi and the companies acquired

see note of the notes 
results of operations revenue 
total revenues decreased to billion in from billion in revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased to billion in from billion in the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased demand  most notably for products used in broadband access  networking infrastructure and storage infrastructure applications  reflecting the economic downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the decline in revenues in this sector was offset partially by the additional revenues from c cube and ami 
revenues for the san systems segment decreased to million in from million in due to decreased demand reflecting industry declines for all products sold in the san systems segment 
as the economic trends reverse  we expect to see sequential quarterly growth in revenues of up to in the first quarter of from the million in the fourth quarter of total revenues increased to billion in from billion in revenues for the semiconductor segment increased to billion in from billion in significant factors that contributed to this revenue growth included increased demand for semiconductor products used in broadband communications  networking infrastructure and storage infrastructure applications  particularly in broadband access and networks  and storage components 
revenues for the san systems segment increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to growth in demand for all products used in the san systems segment 
one customer represented of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  and another customer represented and of our total consolidated revenues for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
one customer represented of total revenues in the semiconductor segment for the year ended december  during  no customer represented or more of total revenues in the semiconductor segment 
during  one customer represented of total semiconductor revenues 
in the san systems segment  there were two customers with revenues representing each  and one customer representing of total san systems revenues for the year ended december  during  there were three customers with revenues representing  and of total san systems revenues 
during  there were three customers with revenues representing  and of san systems revenues 
revenues from domestic operations were million  representing of consolidated revenues for  as compared to billion and billion for and  representing and of consolidated revenues  respectively 
the decline in domestic revenues is mainly due to the severity of the economic downturn in the us as compared to pan asia and japan 
operating costs and expenses 
key elements of the consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenues for the respective segment  were as follows consolidated gross profit margin research and development selling  general and administrative loss income from operations key elements of the statement of operations for the semiconductor and san systems segments  expressed as a percentage of revenues  were as follows semiconductor segment gross profit margin research and development selling  general and administrative loss income from operations san systems segment gross profit margin research and development selling  general and administrative loss income from operations gross profit margin 
we have advanced wafer manufacturing operations in oregon and japan 
we also acquire wafers from foundries in other locations 
this allows us to maintain our ability to provide products to customers with minimal disruption in the manufacturing process due to economic and geographic risks associated with each geographic location 
the gross profit margin percentage for decreased to from in on a consolidated basis  reflecting lower gross profit margins in both of our segments 
the gross profit margin percentage for the semiconductor segment was in compared to in the decrease in the semiconductor segment primarily reflect the economic downturn as evidenced by decreased revenue for higher margin products  higher manufacturing variances and period costs as a percentage of revenues  additional excess inventory and related charges of million in the additional excess inventory and related charges were primarily associated with underutilization charges related to a temporary idling of our fabrication facilities  coupled with inventory production in anticipation of the closing of our colorado springs fabrication facility see note of the notes and a sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue  and was calculated in accordance with our policy  which is primarily based on inventory levels in excess of month judged demand for each specific product 
the gross profit margin percentage for the san systems segment was in compared to in the decrease is primarily attributable to decreased revenue for higher margin products and additional excess inventory and related charges of approximately million recorded during the gross profit margin percentage for increased to from in on a consolidated basis  reflecting improved gross profit margins in both of our segments 
the gross profit margin percentage for the semiconductor segment was in compared to in the increase primarily reflected a combination of the following factors increased production capacity utilization at our fabrication facility in gresham  oregon  which commenced operations in december  and increased revenue from higher margin products used in broadband communications and storage infrastructure applications 
the increase in gross profit margin in as compared to was offset in part by the following factors million non recurring charge associated with the elimination of a non strategic product area  and an increase in compensation related expenses 
the gross profit margin percentage for the san systems segment was in compared to in the increase is primarily attributable to changes in product mix to include newer generation products  which have higher margins than other san business products 
our operating environment  combined with the resources required to operate in the semiconductor industry  requires that we manage a variety of factors 
these factors include  among other things product mix  factory capacity and utilization  manufacturing yields  availability of certain raw materials  terms negotiated with third party subcontractors  and foreign currency fluctuations 
these and other factors could have a significant effect on our gross profit margin in future periods 
changes in the relative strength of the yen may have a greater impact on our gross profit margin than other foreign exchange fluctuations due to our wafer fabrication operations in japan 
although the yen weakened the average yen exchange rate for depreciated from  the effect on gross profit margin and net income was not significant because yen denominated sales offset a substantial portion of yen denominated costs during the period 
moreover  we hedged a portion of our remaining yen exposure 
see note of the notes 
future changes in the relative strength of the yen or mix of foreign currency denominated revenues and costs could have a significant effect on our gross profit margin or operating results 
research and development 
r d expenses increased to million during as compared to million in on a consolidated basis 
r d expenses for the semiconductor segment increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to the following factors increased r d activities based on new r d projects  including those acquired in business combinations in see note of the notes  expenditures related to the continued development of advanced sub micron products and process technologies 
the increase was offset in part by million and million of research and development benefits associated with a technology transfer agreement entered into with silterra in malaysia during and  respectively 
see note of the notes 
we will record an additional million credit to r d over the remaining contract term of less than one year for technology to be transferred to silterra 
r d expenses for the san systems segment increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to higher compensation related expenses due to an increase in average headcount during the periods presented

see note of the notes 
the amounts of ipr d were determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the value of the projects identified to be in progress was determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenues  cost of revenues  research and development costs  selling general and administrative costs and applicable income taxes for the projects 
total revenues for the projects are expected to extend through the dates noted in the above table by acquisition 
these projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
these estimates do not account for any potential synergies that may be realized as a result of the acquisition and are in line with industry averages and growth estimates 
percentage of completion the percentage of completion for the projects for the purchases of the raid business from ami  c cube  paravoice  cacheware and a division of neomagic were determined based on research and development expenses incurred as of the acquisition dates for the projects as a percentage of total research and development expenses to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
the percentage of completion for the projects for the purchases of intraserver  datapath and zsp were determined using milestones representing management s estimate of effort  value added and degree of difficulty of the portion of the projects completed as of the acquisition dates  as compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
the development process is grouped into three phases  with each phase containing between one and five milestones 
the three phases are researching the market requirements and the engineering architecture and feasibility studies  design and verification milestones  and prototyping and testing the product both internal and customer testing 
discount and royalty rates the discount rate is used for the projects to account for the risks associated with the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability level of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances  which could impact the estimates described above 
we applied a royalty rate by project by acquisition to operating income to attribute value for dependency on predecessor core technologies

we acquired zsp s in process dsp research and development project in process that was targeted at the telecommunications market 
the project was completed in development of the above noted technologies that have not yet been completed remains a significant risk to us due to the remaining effort to achieve technological feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
failure to bring the product to market in a timely manner could adversely affect our sales and profitability in the future 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
restructuring of operations and other non recurring items 
we recorded approximately million in restructuring and non recurring charges for the year ended december   consisting of for restructuring of operations and million for other non recurring charges 
restructuring in september  we announced the consolidation of us manufacturing operations at gresham  oregon and the transfer of process research and development from santa clara  california to gresham  oregon 
we also announced the closure of certain assembly activities in fremont  california  which will be transferred offshore 
in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fixed asset write downs due to impairment in the us  losses on termination of operating leases for equipment and facilities  severance for approximately employees across multiple company activities and functions in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific as well as other exit costs 
in december  we recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs due to impairment for the santa clara facility 
we reclassified million  representing the fair market value of the assets identified above  from property  plant and equipment to other current assets during the year to reflect the intention to dispose of the assets within months 
in addition  in december  approximately million in exit costs for the closures of the santa clara facility was recorded relating primarily to labor and facilities charges 
in april  we announced the closure of our colorado springs fabrication facility the facility in august in may  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the facility to a third party 
as part of the agreement  we agreed to purchase a minimum amount of production wafers and die from the facility for a period of months following the close of the transaction 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the facility  of which approximately million was recorded in cost of sales and million was recorded in restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges consisted of fixed asset write downs due to impairment  losses on termination of operating leases for equipment  severance for approximately manufacturing employees and other exit costs 
on august   we announced the termination of the agreement to sell the facility 
in september  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million for fixed asset write downs and other exit costs associated with the planned closure of the facility 
the additional asset write downs during the third quarter of were incurred to reflect the new value of the facility s assets if sold on a piecemeal basis rather than sold as a facility in continued use 
in addition  equipment market values continued to decline in the third quarter of we reclassified approximately million from property  plant and equipment to other current assets to reflect the intention to dispose of the facility within the next twelve months 
the facility was closed in the fourth quarter of in december  we recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs due to impairment for the colorado springs facility 
in addition  approximately million in exit costs for the closure of the colorado springs facilities were recorded relating primarily to labor and facilities charges 
we recorded approximately million in restructuring charges in the second quarter of primarily associated with the write down of fixed assets due to impairment in the us  japan and hong kong that will be disposed of  and severance charges for approximately employees across multiple company activities and functions in the us  europe and asia pacific 
as a result of the continued decline in the equipment market during the third quarter of  we recorded an additional charge of million during the third quarter of to reflect the fair value of the equipment when sold 
in december  we recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs due to impairment in japan 
we plan to sell the assets and accordingly have reclassified million from property  plant and equipment to assets held for sale to reflect the intention to sell the assets within the next months 
the fair value of assets determined to be impaired was the result of independent appraisals and the use of management estimates 
given that current market conditions for the sale of older fabrication facilities and related equipment may continue to deteriorate  there can be no assurance that we will realize its current net book value for the assets 
we will reassess the realizability of the carrying value of these assets at the end of each quarter until the assets are sold or otherwise disposed of and additional adjustments may be necessary 
on january   the company announced a series of actions to reduce costs and tailor company expenses to current revenues 
these actions include restructuring the company s manufacturing operations in tsukuba  japan  divesting the cdma handset and dsl standard product business units and reducing the worldwide workforce by approximately  positions or percent 
as a result of the restructuring actions taken during  we expect to reduce expenses by approximately million in see note of the notes 
the following table sets forth our restructuring reserves as of december balance at restructuring december  expense utilized in thousands write down of excess assets a    lease terminations and maintenance contracts c    facility closure and other exit costs c    payments to employees for severance b   total    a amounts utilized in reflect a non cash write down of fixed assets in the us  japan and hong kong due to impairment of million and cash payments for machinery and equipment decommissioning costs of million 
the fixed asset write downs were accounted for as a reduction of the assets and did not result in a liability 
the million balance as of december  relates to machinery and equipment decommissioning costs in the us b amounts utilized represent cash payments related to the severance of approximately employees during the year ended december  the million balance as of december  will be paid during the first six months of c amounts utilized represent cash payments 
other non recurring items we recorded approximately million in other non recurring charges during as follows million in charges associated with the write down of intangible assets due to impairment

the change in management estimates of the reserve requirements stemmed primarily from the following factors a significant increase in the requirement for manufacturing capacity to meet expected sales growth  which resulted in retention of certain employees originally targeted for termination of employment and in reversal of the reserve for decommissioning costs as a result of retention of the us and japan operations facilities originally targeted for sale  and our ability to exit lease commitments and non cancelable purchase commitments more favorably than originally anticipated in the us and europe

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statements nos 
and sfas and sfas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas replaces apb and eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that they might be impaired 
goodwill is tested for impairment employing a two step method 
first the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  the impairment is measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value 
sfas and sfas are effective for all business combinations completed after june  upon adoption of sfas  amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july  will cease  and intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the criteria for recognition under sfas will be reclassified to goodwill 
we adopted sfas on january   the beginning of fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas  amortization of goodwill and intangibles will be lower by approximately million in as compared to and approximately million of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles will no longer be amortized 
we have completed the transitional goodwill impairment assessment in accordance with sfas and concluded that goodwill is not impaired as of january  in august  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the statement applies to all entities 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
we adopted sfas on january  and it did not have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed 
we adopted sfas on january  and it did not have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell our products in various global markets 
we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers and incur labor and other operating costs in foreign currencies  particularly at our japanese manufacturing facilities 
as a result  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to limit these exposures through operational strategies and financial market instruments 
we use various hedge instruments  primarily forward contracts with maturities of six months or less and currency option contracts  to manage our exposure associated with net asset and liability positions and cash flows denominated in non functional currencies 
we did not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as of december  and interest rate sensitivity 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and outstanding debt 
an interest rate move of basis points of our weighted average worldwide interest rate in affecting our floating rate financial instruments as of december   including both debt obligations and investments  would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year  assuming that the investment balance remains consistent 
in  an interest rate move of basis points of our weighted average worldwide interest rate in affecting our interest sensitive investments would also not have had a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk 
based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   including derivative financial instruments and nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
in and  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would also not have had a significant effect
