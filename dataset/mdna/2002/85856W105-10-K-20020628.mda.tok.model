our customers are primarily located throughout the united states and europe 
we are responsible for developing our current business which was founded in in july  we merged with and into a publicly traded corporation  which was organized under minnesota law in november in september  we acquired infoaccess  inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in july  we acquired the information exchange division of ebt international  inc formerly inso corporation in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
in july  we acquired select assets of resoft  a leading provider of end to end content management solutions for the real estate and legal industries 
this acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
on august   we changed our name to stellent  inc critical accounting policies and judgments revenue recognition we currently derive all of our revenue from licenses of software products and related services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
product license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  for example  a signed agreement or purchase order  ii delivery has occurred  as evidenced by shipping documents and customer acceptance  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and payable within twelve months  iv collectibility is probable and supported by credit checks or past payment history  and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
services revenue consists of fees from consulting and post contract customer support 
consulting services include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
we bill consulting fees either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed price schedule 
our customers typically purchase post contract customer support agreements annually  and our prices of post contract customer support agreements are based on a percentage of the product license fee 
customers purchasing post contract customer support agreements receive product upgrades  web based technical support and telephone hot line support 
we recognize revenue from maintenance agreements ratably over the term of the agreement  typically one year 
expenses cost of revenues consists of technology royalties  costs to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation  as well as personnel and other expenses related to providing services 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  commissions  and costs associated with marketing programs such as advertising  public relations and trade shows 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products and the performance of quality assurance and documentation activities 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs for executive  financial  human resources  information services and other administrative personnel  as well as legal  accounting  insurance costs and provisions for doubtful accounts 
software development cost software development costs may be capitalized once the technological feasibility of the project is established 
the amount of software development costs that may be capitalized is subject to limitations based on the net realizable value of the potential product 
typically the period between achieving technological feasibility of our products and the general availability of the products has been short 
consequently  prior to fiscal year  software development costs qualifying for capitalization were immaterial and were generally expensed to research and development costs 
other since our inception through march   we have incurred substantial costs to develop and acquire our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our sales and marketing  research and development and services departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
as a result  we had an accumulated deficit of million at march  beginning in  we have implemented several cost cutting measures  including a reduction in work force of approximately since our december quarter 
these cost controlling and reducing measures are in response to the current economic slowdown both in the united states and internationally and were primarily in the research and development  marketing and general and administrative areas 
however  we are continuing to invest in the sales area in order to expand our customer base and anticipate that  with evidence of a sustained recovery of the united states and international economies  we would continue to invest further across all areas of our company 
because of this  we anticipate that the percentage of expenses as compared to total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses will fluctuate from period to period depending primarily on when we hire new personnel  the timing of certain sales and marketing programs  the research programs that we put in place and the potential expansion of operations 
in addition  our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to predict future operating results 
we cannot be certain that we will sustain revenue growth 
results of operations three months ended march  compared to three months ended march  revenues total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the three months ended march  from million for the three months ended march  the decrease in revenues was attributable to unanticipated delays in information technology spending decisions by customers and difficult economic conditions

cost of revenues for product licenses increased by million  or  to million for the three months ended march  from million for the three months ended march  gross profit as a percentage of revenues for product licenses was for the three months ended march  compared to for the three months ended march  the decrease is due primarily to us having approximately million of fixed costs per quarter against a lower base of revenues and a change in product mix with us licensing more products with variable royalty costs associated with them in the march  quarter than we licensed in the march  quarter

other income expense interest income was million for the three months ended march  compared to million for the three months ended march  interest income is primarily related to marketable securities purchased with the proceeds of our public stock offerings completed in june and march the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to decreases in the interest rates earned by invested funds resulting from decreases in market interest rates  which have declined over 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the growth in of our customer base and the increase in customers as a result of our acquisition of scd  increased sales to existing customers and increased sales of our stellent content management system

it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or exceed the expectations of current and future public market analysts and investors 
for instance  if revenues or earnings per share do not meet projections  we expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock to decline 
we expect our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past  and will likely cause fluctuations in the future  include demand for our products and services  the timing of new product introductions and sales of our products and services  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  research and development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web content management solutions  the mix of revenues from product licenses and services  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  general economic conditions  and public announcements by our competitors 
in addition  our products are typically shipped when the orders are received  so our license backlog at the beginning of any quarter in the past has represented only a small portion of expected license revenues for that quarter 
further  we recognize a substantial percentage of product license revenues in the last month of the quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter 
as a result  our sales pipeline at the beginning of a quarter may not give us reasonable assurance about the sales that will be closed in that quarter  and the delay or cancellation of any large orders could result in a significant shortfall from anticipated revenues 
since our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues could result in significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
pro forma net income per common share our pro forma basic net income per share is computed by dividing pro forma net income by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and our pro forma diluted net income per share is computed by dividing pro forma net income by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and common share equivalents relating to stock options and warrants  when dilutive

the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards on an annual basis will be limited as a result of ownership changes in connection with the sale of equity securities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax asset because of uncertainty regarding its full realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  management considered such factors as our history of operating losses  potential future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations and satisfied our capital expenditure requirements primarily through revolving working capital and term loans from banking institutions  private placements and public offerings of securities and proceeds from the sales of assets related to prior lines of business 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended march   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended march  the decrease in cash provided by operations is due primarily to higher operating expenses 
to date  we have invested our capital expenditures primarily in property and equipment  consisting largely of computer hardware and software 
capital expenditures for the year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
we have also entered into capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase as our employee base grows 
at march   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
as of march   we had million in cash and marketable securities and million in working capital 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  in march  we completed a public offering of our common stock that raised approximately million in proceeds for us  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of approximately million 
in april  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option  raising additional net proceeds of approximately million 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  particularly through march  on a longer term basis  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or on any terms  or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions that could utilize equity and or cash resources 
such opportunities could develop quickly due to market and competitive factors 
related party transactions in december we entered into a note receivable of million with a distributor 
through march  the distributor had paid the minimum payments required under the note receivable with its own cash  and at the end of march  it paid off the remaining note receivable with short term bridge financing 
the distributor completely repaid this short term bridge financing in april through a traditional banking relationship 
the short term bridge financing was provided at normal market rates by beartooth capital  a venture financing organization controlled and funded by robert olson  a shareholder and our chairman 
there was no relationship prior to the bridge financing  and there is no existing relationship between beartooth capital and the distributor 
furthermore  we provided no compensation or guarantees to beartooth capital or robert olson for the short term bridge financing  nor were we otherwise involved in this transaction 
at march  we held investments in and notes with five non public start up technology companies  owning approximately to of these companies  and in a publicly traded technology company listed on nasdaq  active iq  of which we owned  excluding warrants 
the value of these investments at march  is approximately million 
at march   the market value of our equity in active iq was approximately million more than our investment value of million 
the offsetting amount does not effect the consolidated statements of operations but is shown as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section on the consolidated balance sheet 
during the year ended march   the company recognized license revenue of approximately million from companies in which we had an equity investment  with approximately million from active iq in december at march   the company had an account receivable balance of million associated from these transactions 
license revenue recognized for the years ended march  and from companies in which we had an equity investment was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company also acquired intellectual property from active iq in april for approximately million  which was capitalized and is being amortized over a three year period 
certain officers and a director of the company also held an investment in active iq during the year  approximating  excluding warrants 
these investments were sold at no gain during the year 
new accounting pronouncements goodwill and other acquired intangible asset the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  in july major provisions of these statements and their effective dates for us are as follows all business combinations initiated after june  are to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or as part of a related contract  asset or liability 
goodwill  as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives  acquired after june   will not be amortized 
effective april   all previously recognized goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to amortization 
effective april   goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing and segment reporting 
beginning on april   annual goodwill amortization of approximately  and annual amortization of approximately  relating to intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be recognized 
by march   we will have completed a transitional fair value based impairment test of goodwill as of april  by june   we will have completed a transitional impairment test of all intangible assets with indefinite lives 
impairment losses  if any  resulting from the transitional testing would be recognized in the quarter ended june   as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the financial position of us 
impairment of long lived asset in september  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas and is effective april  for us 
this statement is not anticipated to have a current material effect on the financial statements of us  but could have a future effect in the event that an asset impairment has occurred 
consideration paid to reseller in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
this issue is effective for periods beginning after december  and addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is a an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and should be deducted from revenue when recognized or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and should be included as a cost or expense when recognized 
we enter into cooperative advertising programs with some of our resellers 
when we receive an identifiable benefit in return for consideration  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received  the cooperative advertising is accounted for as advertising expense 
if the fair value cannot be estimated or an identifiable benefit is not received the cooperative advertising is accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
eitf  will be adopted by us on april   and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors disclosure regarding forward looking statements this form k for the fiscal year ended march  contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as on assumptions made by and information currently available to us at the time such statements were made 
when used in this form k  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend and similar expressions  as they relate us  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
although we believe these statements are reasonable  readers of this form k should be aware that actual results could differ materially from those projected by such forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors listed below 
readers of this form k should consider carefully the factors listed below  as well as the other information and data contained in this form k 
we caution the reader  however  that such list of factors under the caption risk factors in the our form k may not be exhaustive and that those or other factors  many of which are outside of the our control  could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth hereunder 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
fluctuations in our operating results may make it difficult to predict our future performance 
while our products and services are not seasonal  our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
a large part of our sales typically occurs in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter 
if these sales were delayed from one quarter to the next for any reason  our operating results could fluctuate dramatically 
in addition  our sales cycles may vary  making the timing of sales difficult to predict 
furthermore  our infrastructure costs are generally fixed 
as a result  modest fluctuations in revenues between quarters may cause large fluctuations in operating results 
these factors all tend to make the timing of revenues unpredictable and may lead to high period to period fluctuations in operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate for several additional reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the following demand for our products and services  the timing of new product introductions and sales of our products and services  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  research and development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web content management solutions  the mix of revenues from product licenses and services  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  general economic conditions  and public announcements by our competitors 
our success depends on our ability to expand our sales force and distribution channels 
to increase our market share and revenues  we must increase the size of our sales force and the number of our distribution channel partners 
our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there is intense competition for sales personnel in our business  and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in attracting  integrating  motivating and retaining new sales personnel 
our existing or future distribution channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
in addition  we will need to resolve potential conflicts  if any  among our sales force and distribution channel partners 
potential acquisitions may be difficult to complete or to integrate and may divert management s attention 
we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity  we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for that acquisition  successfully finance the acquisition or integrate the new business or products into our existing business and operations 
in addition  the negotiation of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses or products may divert management time and resources from our existing business and operations 
to finance acquisitions  we may use a substantial portion of our available cash or we may issue additional securities  which would cause dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be profitable in the future 
our revenues may not grow in future periods  may not grow at past rates and we may not sustain our quarterly pro forma profitability 
if we do not regain our recent pro forma profitability  the market price of our stock may fall 
our ability to regain our recent pro forma profitable operations depends upon many factors beyond our direct control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the demand for our products  our ability to quickly introduce new products  the level of product and price competition  our ability to control costs  and general economic conditions the intense competition in our industry may reduce our future sales and profits 
the market for our products is highly competitive and is likely to become more competitive 
we may not be able to compete successfully in our chosen marketplace  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional competition may cause pricing pressure  reduced sales and margins  or prevent our products from gaining and sustaining market acceptance 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  and substantially more resources than we have 
competitors with greater resources than ours may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new opportunities  changing technology  product standards or customer requirements 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
any failure to properly manage our growth may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the rapid growth that we have experienced places significant challenges on our management  administrative and operational resources 
to properly manage this growth  we must  among other things  implement and improve additional and existing administrative  financial and operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
we will also need to expand our finance  administrative and operations staff 
we may not be able to complete the improvements to our systems  procedures and controls necessary to support our future operations in a timely manner 
management may not be able to hire  train  integrate  retain  motivate and manage required personnel and may not be able to successfully identify  manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
in connection with our expansion  we plan to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund greater levels of research and development  broaden services and support and improve operational and financial systems 
our failure to generate additional revenue commensurate with an increase in operating expenses during any fiscal period could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for that period 
we depend on the continued service of our key personnel 
we are a small company and depend greatly on the knowledge and experience of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if we lose any of these key personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional personnel with the highly specialized expertise necessary to engineer  design and support our products and services 
like other software companies  we face intense competition for qualified personnel 
we may not be able to attract or retain such personnel 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our content management and viewing software products for our revenues 
we currently derive all of our revenues from product licenses and services associated with our system of content management and viewing software products 
the market for content management and viewing software products is new and rapidly evolving 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will emerge  or if it does emerge  that it will be sustainable 
if we do not continue to increase revenues related to our existing products or generate revenues from new products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we will continue to depend on revenues related to new and enhanced versions of our software products for the foreseeable future 
our success will largely depend on our ability to increase sales from existing products and generate sales from product enhancements and new products 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in upgrading and marketing our existing products or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services 
the market for our products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
technological advances could make our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our business 
in addition  complex software product development involves certain inherent risks  including risks that errors may be found in a product enhancement or new product after its release  even after extensive testing  and the risk that discovered errors may not be corrected in a timely manner 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or incur significant expense in doing so  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate  time consuming and expensive 
we currently have no patents or pending patent applications 
without significant patent or copyright protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who develop functionally equivalent products 
we may also be subject to claims that our current products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
any such claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we anticipate that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims due to growth in the number of products and competitors in our industry  and the overlap in functionality of products in different industries 
any infringement claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  expensive to defend  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation 
we rely on trade secret protection  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information 
despite our attempts to protect our confidential and proprietary information  others may gain access to this information 
alternatively  other companies may independently develop substantially equivalent information 
our products may not be compatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems 
our products utilize interfaces that are compatible with commercial web browsers 
in addition  our stellent content management system is a server based system written in java that functions in both windows nt and unix environments 
we must continually modify our products to conform to commercial web browsers and operating systems 
if our products were to become incompatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems  our business would be harmed 
in addition  uncertainty related to the timing and nature of product introductions or modifications by vendors of web browsers and operating systems may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be subject to product liability claims if our products fail to perform to specifications 
if software errors or design defects in our products cause damage to customers data and our agreements do not protect us from related product liability claims  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims if our security features fail to prevent unauthorized third parties from entering our customers intranet  extranet or internet web sites 
our software products are complex and sophisticated and may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors  bugs or viruses spread by third parties may result in the loss of market acceptance or the loss of customer data 
our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions where we operate 
future regulations could be adopted that restrict our business 
federal  state or foreign agencies may adopt new legislation or regulations governing the use and quality of web content 
we cannot predict if or how any future laws or regulations would impact our business and operations 
even though these laws and regulations may not apply to our business directly  they could indirectly harm us to the extent that they impact our customers and potential customers 
significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock could result in securities litigation against us 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been brought against publicly held companies following periods of volatility in the price of their securities 
if we were subject to such litigation due to volatility in our stock price  we may incur substantial costs 
such litigation could divert the attention of our senior management away from our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by each of the following factors  many of which are outside of our control variations in quarterly operating results  changes in estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry  announcements by us of significant events  such as major sales  acquisitions of businesses or losses of major customers  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our equity securities 
our performance will depend on the continuing growth and acceptance of the web 
our products are designed to be used with intranets  extranets and the internet 
if the use of these methods of electronic communication does not grow  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
continued growth in the use of the web will require ongoing and widespread interest in its capabilities for communication and commerce 
its growth will also require maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure supporting its use and the development of performance improvements  such as high speed modems 
the web infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by continued growth 
the ongoing development of corporate intranets depends on continuation of the trend toward network based computing and on the willingness of businesses to reengineer the processes used to create  store  manage and distribute their data 
all of these factors are outside of our control 
our existing shareholders have significant influence over us 
as of march   robert f 
olson  our chairman  holds approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  mr 
olson is able to exercise significant control over our affairs 
additionally  our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of our common stock 
these persons have significant influence over our affairs  including approval of the acquisition or disposition of assets  future issuances of common stock or other securities and the authorization of dividends on our common stock 
our directors and executive officers could use their stock ownership to delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company  depriving shareholders of the opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price 
we can issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval  which could adversely affect the rights of common shareholders 
our articles of incorporation permit us to establish the rights  privileges  preferences and restrictions  including voting rights  of unissued shares of our capital stock and to issue such shares without approval from our shareholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock may suffer as a result of the rights granted to holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  we could issue preferred stock to prevent a change in control of our company  depriving shareholders of an opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price 
our shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of minnesota law may make a takeover of stellent difficult  depriving shareholders of opportunities to sell shares at above market prices 
our shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of minnesota law may have the effect of discouraging attempts to acquire stellent without the approval of our board of directors 
consequently  our shareholders may lose opportunities to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income on cash and marketable securities is affected by changes in interest rates in the united states 
through march   changes in these rates have had a significant effect on our company 
interest rates earned on invested funds have fallen by over since december we believe that there may be future exposure to interest rate market risk 
our investments are held in commercial paper which are affected by equity price market risk and other factors 
we do not anticipate that exposure to these risks will have a material impact onus  due to the nature of our investments 
we have no history of  and do not anticipate in the future  investing in derivative financial instruments 
most transactions with international customers are entered into in us dollars  precluding the need for foreign currency hedges 
any transactions that are currently entered into in foreign currency are not deemed material to the financial statements 
thus  the exposure to market risk is not material
