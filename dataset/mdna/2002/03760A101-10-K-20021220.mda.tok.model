item legal proceedings nalge nunc international  a subsidiary in our labware and life sciences business segment  has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at the aqua tech site in south carolina the aqua tech site with respect to a previously owned facility 
an action has been conducted at the aqua tech site for the removal of surface contaminants under the supervision of the environmental protection agency epa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla 
our total expenses including legal fees to date have been approximately  the site has been placed by the epa on the federal national priority list under cercla  which is a prerequisite to any federally mandated requirement for long term remedial work at the site under cercla  such as would be involved in soil and groundwater remediation 
we are participating with a prp group composed of approximately parties in an agreement with the epa to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study  which will be used by the epa to determine what remedy  if any  should be required at the site 
a draft remedial investigation was submitted to the epa in august  and a draft baseline risk assessment was submitted in october after review of the draft remedial investigation  the epa requested and obtained additional sampling work from the prp group 
the final remedial investigation was submitted in  and the feasibility study is now expected to be completed in june because the study  which involves extensive testing to characterize the existence  extent and nature of any contamination in order to determine potential remedies  has not yet been completed  an estimate of our potential liability cannot be made 
our share of waste allegedly sent to the site is reportedly not more than of the total waste sent  therefore  even though cercla does provide for joint and several liability  we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
applied biotech  inc abi  a subsidiary in our clinical diagnostics business segment  formerly manufactured and supplied immunoassay pregnancy tests to warner lambert co 
now part of pfizer inc 
warner lambert sold the tests to retailers who sell them over the counter to consumers 
abi supplied the product to warner lambert pursuant to a supply agreement that warner lambert claims required abi to defend and indemnify warner lambert with respect to any liability arising out of claims that the product infringes any patents held by third parties 
on january   conopco  inc d b a unipath diagnostics company filed a lawsuit against warner lambert in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
the unipath diagnostics business  along with this lawsuit  were subsequently sold to inverness medical switzerland gmbh inverness 
inverness as conopco s successor claims in the suit that the warner lambert pregnancy test supplied by abi infringes certain patents owned by inverness 
abi agreed to defend the lawsuit on behalf of warner lambert 
in november  the us district court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of warner lambert and abi  ruling that abi s product does not infringe the patents 
the us court of appeals vacated the summary judgment and held that the case should be returned to the trial court for further consideration 
a petition for rehearing has been filed in the us court of appeals 
we believe  although there can be no assurance that  the resolution of this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  on october   armkel  llc sued pfizer in the us district court for the district of new jersey for patent infringement with respect to these same products 
to date  abi has not agreed to defend this lawsuit on behalf of pfizer 
abi does not believe that it has an obligation to defend and indemnify pfizer with respect to this lawsuit 
further  it believes that there are meritorious defenses to the patent claims 
the company or its subsidiaries are at any one time parties to a number of lawsuits or subject to claims arising out of our respective operations  or the operation of businesses divested since the s for 
table of contents which certain subsidiaries may continue to have legal or contractual liability  including product liability  patent and trademark or other intellectual property infringement  contractual liability  workplace safety  and environmental claims and cases  some of which involve claims for substantial damages 
we are vigorously defending lawsuits and other claims against us 
we believe that any liabilities which might reasonably result from any of the pending cases and claims would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance as to this or that litigation having such a material adverse effect will not arise in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading manufacturer and provider of value added products in three business segments clinical diagnostics  labware and life sciences  and laboratory equipment 
our fiscal year ends on september we encourage you to review our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  copies of which are included herein 
during march  we made the decision to dispose of our vacuum deposition chamber business  vacuum process technology  inc vpt 
the decision was made following a slow down in the telecommunications industry  in which vpt targets a majority of its products  and as a result  the business no longer meets the company s strategic requirements 
accordingly  results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations  and prior periods have been restated 
in the event the company ultimately disposes of vpt for an amount less than the carrying value of the business  an additional charge will be recognized upon disposal 
for business reporting purposes  vpt was previously classified in the clinical diagnostics business segment 
on december   apogent  then known as sybron international corporation  completed the spin off spin off of its dental business as a separate publicly traded company 
the spin off was effected by way of a pro rata distribution of all the outstanding common stock and related preferred stock purchase rights of sybron dental specialties  inc sds to apogent s shareholders 
sds is now an independent public company operating what was sybron s dental business 
as a result of the spin off  all historical financial data relating to the operations of sds and its affiliates prior to the spin off have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards the company adopted statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on october  sfas requires that all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has performed its initial impairment tests as well as its initial annual impairment test and the results indicate no circumstances of impaired goodwill 
the following table reconciles reported amounts to that which would have been reported if the current method of accounting was used for the fiscal years ended september     and year ended september  a income before extraordinary items reported income before extraordinary items add back goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted income before extraordinary items net income reported net income add back goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted net income basic earnings per common share reported earnings per share add back goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share reported fully diluted earnings per share add back goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted diluted earnings per common share a historical reported amounts have been adjusted to reflect the disposal of vpt 
table of contents on october   fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that replaced fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of this project were to develop one accounting model  based on the framework established in statement  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
statement requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
the provisions of statement applied to the company effective october  the company accounted for the disposal of vpt consistent with this statement 
effective september   the company adopted the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which requires all amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling to be classified as sales revenues 
accordingly  all historical sales revenue amounts have been adjusted to reflect these charges 
the costs related to shipping and handling are classified as a selling expense in selling  general and administrative expense 
the following table reconciles historically reported amounts to those adjusted in accordance with eitf year ended september  a net sales reported net sales reclassification of freight income adjusted net sales cost of products sold reported cost of goods products sold reclassification of freight costs adjusted cost of products sold selling  general and administrative expenses reported selling  general and administrative expenses reclassification of freight income and expense adjusted selling  general  and administrative expenses a historical reported amounts have been adjusted to reflect the disposal of vpt

international operations our us subsidiaries hold approximately of our assets and generated approximately of our income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended september   with the balance attributable to our foreign subsidiaries 
portions of our sales  income and cash flows from both domestic and foreign subsidiaries are derived internationally 
the financial position and the results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  are measured using the local currency of the countries in which such operations are conducted and are then translated into us dollars 
while the reported income of foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partially mitigated by the fact that manufacturing costs and other expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally incurred in the same currencies in which sales are generated 
such effects of foreign currency fluctuations are also mitigated by the fact that such subsidiaries operations are conducted in numerous foreign countries and  therefore  in numerous foreign currencies 
in addition  our us export sales may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases upward or downward according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 

table of contents from time to time we may employ currency hedges to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
if currency hedges are not employed  we may be exposed to earnings volatility as a result of foreign currency fluctuations
