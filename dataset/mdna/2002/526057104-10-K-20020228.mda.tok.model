in addition  we have unconsolidated partnerships in georgia  michigan  missouri and north carolina 
revenues from sales of homes increased in and in compared to the previous years as a result of a increase and a increase in the number of home deliveries  and a increase and a increase in the average sales price in and  respectively 
new home deliveries were higher primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of us home s homebuilding activity in  compared to seven months inclusion in the average sales price of homes delivered increased in and primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of our existing markets  combined with changes in our product mix 
during  us home and its subsidiaries contributed of both our homebuilding revenues and our homebuilding expenses 
during  during which we owned us home and its subsidiaries for seven months  us home and its subsidiaries contributed of our homebuilding revenues and of our homebuilding expenses 
gross margin percentages on home sales were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was due to improved operational efficiencies and strength in the homebuilding markets in which we operate 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage in compared to was impacted by purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of us home 
the gross margin percentage in would have been excluding the effect of purchase accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to in compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses  compared to we provide incentives to our associates to achieve the highest level of financial performance and combined with our record results in  resulted in significantly higher bonuses when compared to the improvement in compared to resulted primarily from the increased volume and efficiencies realized from the acquisition of us home in may revenues from land sales totaled million in  compared to million in and million in gross profits from land sales totaled million  or a margin  in  compared to million  or an margin  in and million  or a margin  in equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships increased to million in  compared to million in and million in margins achieved on sales of land and equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales by us and our unconsolidated partnerships 
new home orders increased in and in compared to the previous years 
the increases in and were due to the inclusion of a full year of us home s homebuilding activity in and seven months of us home s homebuilding activity in backlog dollar value was billion at november   compared to billion at november   due primarily to lower new orders in the months immediately following the tragic events of september  financial services our financial services division provides mortgage financing  title insurance and closing services for both our homebuyers and others 
the division also resells the residential mortgage loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market and provides high speed internet access  cable television and alarm monitoring services for both our homebuyers and other customers 
the following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our financial services division 
the results of us home s financial services operations are included in the information since its acquisition in may years ended november  dollars in thousands revenues    costs and expenses    operating earnings    dollar value of mortgages originated    number of mortgages originated    mortgage capture rate of lennar homebuyers number of title transactions    operating earnings from our financial services division increased to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was partially attributable to pretax earnings of approximately million primarily related to the sale of our retained mortgage servicing rights 
additionally  the increase reflects the successful operational efficiencies which resulted from the combination of our and us home s mortgage operations under the universal american mortgage banner and the consolidation of our title operations under the north american title banner 
the increase also reflects a greater level of refinance activity and a higher capture rate of our homebuyers as well as a full year of earnings contribution from us home in the increase in compared to was primarily due to the seven months of earnings contribution from us home 
the earnings contribution from us home represented of the division s operating earnings in and of the division s operating earnings in corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in compared to and in and  respectively 
interest interest expense was million  or of total revenues  in  million  or of total revenues  in and million  or of total revenues  in interest incurred was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the average rates for interest incurred were  and in  and  respectively 
the average debt outstanding was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
financial condition and capital resources at november   we had available cash of million  compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase in cash was primarily due to million of net earnings generated from operations during cash flows provided by operating activities in were reduced by financial services loans held for sale or disposition of million and million in receivables 
we sell the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market  generally within thirty days of the closing of the loan 
the cash related to these loans and receivables was primarily received in december and was used to pay down our warehouse lines of credit 
additionally  although inventories decreased million in  they increased million in  as we positioned ourselves for future growth 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to cash used in investing activities of million in in  million was provided by the sale of substantially all of our mortgage servicing rights and million related to net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest 
this generation of cash was offset by million of net additions to operating properties and equipment 
in  million of cash was used in the acquisitions of properties and businesses  which included million used for the acquisition of us home 
we finance our land acquisition and development activities  construction activities  financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations  as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities 
in addition  we have in recent years sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets  and we have an effective securities act registration statement under which we could sell to the public up to million of debt securities  common stock or preferred stock 
we also buy land under option agreements  which permit us to acquire portions of properties when we are ready to build homes on them 
the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings is managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets  careful management of the land development process  limitation of risk by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land and obtaining access to land through option arrangements 
our senior secured credit facilities provide us with up to billion of financing 
the credit facilities consist of a million five year revolving credit facility  a million day revolving credit facility and a million term loan b 
we may elect to convert borrowings under the day revolving credit facility to a term loan which would mature in may at november   there was million outstanding under the term loan b and we had paid down our revolving credit facilities to zero 
in the second quarter of  we issued  for gross proceeds of approximately million  zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due notes with a face amount at maturity of approximately million 
the notes were issued at a price of per  face amount at maturity  which equates to a yield to maturity over the life of the notes of 
proceeds from the offering  after underwriting discount  were approximately million 
we used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and added the balance of the net proceeds to our working capital 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at any time  if the sale price of our common stock exceeds certain thresholds or in other specified instances  at the rate of approximately shares per  face amount at maturity  or a total of approximately million shares 
the conversion ratio equates to an initial conversion price of per share when our stock price was per share 
these shares will be included in the calculation of our diluted earnings per share if the average closing price of our common stock over the last twenty trading days of each quarter exceeds of the accreted conversion price 
this calculation equated to per share at november  holders have the option to require us to repurchase the notes on any of the fifth  tenth  or fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to the purchase date 
we have the option to satisfy the repurchases with any combination of cash and or shares of common stock 
we have the option to redeem the notes  in cash  at any time after the fifth anniversary for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to redemption 
we will pay contingent interest on the notes during specified six month periods beginning on april  if the market price of the notes exceeds specified levels 
at november   the carrying value of the outstanding notes  net of unamortized original issue discount  was million 
as a result of the us home acquisition  holders of us home s publicly held notes totaling million were entitled to require us home to repurchase the notes for of their principal amount within days after the transaction was completed 
independent of that requirement  in april  we made a tender offer for all of the notes and a solicitation of consents to modify provisions of the indentures relating to the notes 
as a result of the tender offer and required repurchases after the acquisition  we paid approximately million in  which includes tender and consent fees  for million of us home s notes 
in may  we issued million of senior notes due at a price of to finance a portion of the purchase price of us home s publicly held notes that were tendered in response to our offer and consent solicitation in april  and to pay associated costs and expenses 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than subsidiaries engaged in mortgage and reinsurance activities 
proceeds from the offering  after underwriting discount and expenses  were approximately million 
at november   the carrying amount of the senior notes was million 
in february  we issued million of senior notes 
the senior notes are due in and were issued for the purpose of reducing amounts outstanding under revolving credit facilities and redeeming outstanding notes 
proceeds from the offering  after underwriting and market discounts  expenses and settlement of a related interest rate hedge agreement  were approximately million 
the senior notes are collateralized by the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
in march  we redeemed all of the outstanding senior notes due of one of our subsidiaries  greystone homes  inc  at a price of of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest 
cash paid to redeem the notes was million  which approximated their carrying value 
at november   the carrying value of the senior notes was million 
in july  we issued  for million  zero coupon senior convertible debentures due the debentures with a face amount at maturity of million 
the debentures have an effective interest rate of 
the debentures are convertible at any time into our common stock at the rate of shares per  face amount at maturity 
if the debentures are converted during the first five years  we may elect to pay cash equal to the fair value of the common stock at the time of the conversion 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures on any of the fifth  tenth or fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date for the initial issue price plus accrued original issue discount 
we have the option to satisfy the repurchases with any combination of cash and or shares of our common stock 
we have the option to redeem the debentures  in cash  at any time after the fifth anniversary for the initial issue price plus accrued original issue discount 
the debentures are collateralized by the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
at november   the carrying value of outstanding debentures  net of unamortized original issue discount  was million 
our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was at november   compared to at november  the decrease primarily resulted from cash generated by our operations during in addition to the use of capital in our ordinary homebuilding and financial services activities  we will continue to actively evaluate various other uses of capital which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital requirements 
this may include acquisitions of or investments in other entities 
these activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities  cash generated from operations  sales of assets or the issuance of public debt  common stock or preferred stock 
our financial services division finances its mortgage loan activities by pledging them as collateral for borrowings under a line of credit totaling million 
borrowings under the financial services line of credit were million and million at november  and  respectively 
during  we sold substantially all of our retained mortgage servicing rights and realized a pretax profit of approximately million 
we have various interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations 
the interest rate swaps mature at various dates through and fix the libor index to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied at an average interest rate of at november  the net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates 
counterparties to each of the above agreements are major financial institutions 
at november   the fair value of the interest rate swaps  net of tax  was a million liability 
our financial services division  in the normal course of business  uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the division enters into forward commitments and option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale or disposition from increases in market interest rates 
we do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance 
our stock option and restricted stock plan the plan provides for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers  employees and directors 
the exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant 
no options granted under the plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant 
thereafter  exercises are permitted in installments determined when the options are granted 
each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not more than years after the date of the grant 
at november    shares of restricted stock were outstanding under the plan 
the stock was valued based on its market price on the date of grant 
the grants vest over years 
unearned compensation arising from the restricted stock grants is amortized to expense over the period of restrictions and is shown as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
in june  our board of directors increased our previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
we may repurchase these shares in the open market from time to time 
during  we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock 
as of november   under prior approvals  we had repurchased approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or per share 
we have shelf registration statements under the securities act of  as amended  relating to up to million of equity or debt securities which we may sell for cash and up to million of equity or debt securities which we may issue in connection with acquisitions of companies or interests in them  businesses  or assets 
as of november   no securities had been issued under these registration statements 
in march  we entered into an equity draw down agreement with a major international banking firm the firm under which we have the option to sell common stock  up to proceeds of million  to the firm in increments of up to million or such higher amount as may be agreed to by the parties per month 
in the event we elect to sell common stock  the sales price is equal to of the average of the daily high and low stock price from time to time 
as of november   we had issued million shares under the agreement resulting in proceeds to us of million  all of which occurred in fiscal we believe we maintain excellent relationships with the financial institutions participating in our financing arrangements and have no reason to believe that these relationships will not continue in the future 
based on our current financial condition and credit relationships  we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth 
investments in unconsolidated partnerships we frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
through partnerships  we reduce and share our risk and the amount invested in land while increasing access to potential future homesites 
the use of partnerships also  in some instances  enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access  or could not obtain access on as favorable terms  without the participation of a strategic partner 
our partners generally are third party homebuilders  land sellers seeking a share of the profits from development of the land or real estate professionals who do not have the capital and or expertise to develop properties by themselves 
while we view the use of unconsolidated partnerships as beneficial to our homebuilding activities  we do not view them as essential to those activities 
many of the partnerships in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
at november   we had ownership interests of between to in these unconsolidated partnerships 
in many instances  we are appointed as the day to day manager of the partnerships and receive fees for performing this function 
during  and  we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling million  million  and million  respectively  from unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests 
we may obtain options or other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated partnerships 
option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when we receive the options 
during  and  million  million  and million  respectively  of the unconsolidated partnerships revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
at november   the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of billion and total liabilities of million  which included million of notes and mortgages payable 
in some instances  we and or our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees on certain partnership debt 
we provided guarantees totaling million of which million were limited maintenance guarantees 
when we provide guarantees  the partnership generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders 
these limited guarantees only apply if the partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the fair value of the collateral generally land and improvements thereto is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance 
if we are required to make a payment under these guarantees to bring the fair value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance  the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase our share of any funds distributed upon the dissolution of the partnership 
during  the unconsolidated partnerships in which we were a partner generated million of revenues and incurred million of expenses  resulting in net earnings of million 
our share of those net earnings was million 
we do not include in our income our pro rata partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
instead  we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships when title passes to a third party homebuyer  which in effect defers recognition of the partnership earnings until we sell the land 
at the time of the transfer of our commercial real estate investment to lnr property corporation lnr  and the spin off of lnr to our stockholders  we formed lennar land partners with lnr  a owned unconsolidated partnership  which is included in the above discussion of unconsolidated partnerships 
we also have several other unconsolidated partnerships with lnr 
in these partnerships  we provide the residential development experience and lnr contributes the commercial property expertise 
in  and  we purchased land from lennar land partners for a total of million  million and million  respectively 
we believe the amounts we paid for land purchased from lennar land partners approximates the amounts we would have paid to independent third parties for similar properties 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase including option contracts  development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business 
option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to acquire portions of properties when we are ready to build homes on them 
this reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings 
at november   we had million of primarily non refundable option deposits and advanced costs  with entities including unconsolidated partnerships  which allows us to acquire approximately  homesites 
the minimum aggregate principal maturities of senior notes and other debts payable during the five years subsequent to november  are as follows million  million  million  million and million 
the remaining principal obligations are due subsequent to november  our debt arrangements contain certain financial covenants with which we were in compliance at november  the minimum aggregate principal maturities of our financial services division s notes and other debts payable during the five years subsequent to november  are as follows million and million 
we have entered into agreements to lease certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases 
future minimum payments under the noncancelable leases are as follows million  million  million  million  million and thereafter million 
we are committed  under various letters of credit  to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business 
outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled million at november  additionally  we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of million 
we do not believe that any such bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
at november   our financial services division s pipeline of loans in process totaled approximately billion 
to minimize credit risk  we use the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to our lending activities 
since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers  the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
loans in the pipeline of loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrower totaled approximately million as of november  substantially all of these commitments were for periods of days or less 
mandatory mortgage backed securities mbs forward commitments are used by the financial services division to hedge our interest rate exposure during the period from when we make an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by entering into agreements with investment bankers with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and current market value 
at november   we had open commitments amounting to million to sell mbs with varying settlement dates through january economic conditions despite difficult economic conditions in large portions of the united states during much of  the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply demand relationship as well as low interest rates 
as a result of this favorable environment  our new orders increased by in giving pro forma effect for all of for the may acquisition of us home corporation 
new orders decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of the tragic events of september   resulting in a lower backlog at november  than at the same date in backlog backlog represents the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts 
homes are sold using sales contracts which are generally accompanied by sales deposits 
before entering into sales contracts  we generally prequalify our customers 
in some instances  purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home or fail to qualify for financing and under certain other circumstances 
we experienced an average cancellation rate of in  compared to and in and  respectively 
although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes  they have not had a material impact on sales  operations or liquidity  because we closely monitor the progress of prospective buyers in obtaining financing and use the information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes 
we do not recognize revenue on homes covered by pending sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners 
seasonality we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings 
because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months  we typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half 
as a result  our earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of the fiscal year 
interest rates and changing prices inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
rising interest rates  as well as increased materials and labor costs  may reduce gross margins 
in recent years  the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us 
in addition  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method and requires acquired intangible assets to be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if certain criteria are met 
we adopted sfas no 
for all future acquisitions 
sfas no 
no longer requires or permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we adopted sfas no 
on december  because of that  amortization of goodwill of approximately million per year will not be incurred in the future 
we do not currently believe that the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
provides accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year 
we do not currently believe that the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt obligations  mortgage loans and mortgage loans held for sale or disposition 
we utilize derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we also utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risk associated with our mortgage loan portfolio 
the tables on the following pages provide information at november  and about our significant derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used for purposes that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for mortgage loans held for sale or disposition  mortgage loans and investments and senior notes and other debts payable  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair market values at november  and weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at november  and for interest rate swaps  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates and estimated fair market values at november  and notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts 
our limited purpose finance subsidiaries have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long term financings 
these limited purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of  and interest on  these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral and therefore  they received little more than is required to pay that debt service and are excluded from the following tables
