item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with roper s consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated 
amounts are dollars in thousands and percentages are of net sales 
year ended october  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings year ended october  industrial controls net sales    gross profit    operating profit    fluid handling net sales    gross profit    operating profit    analytical instrumentation net sales    gross profit    operating profit    includes results of hansen technologies from september and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented 
operating profit excludes restructuring charges and unallocated corporate administrative costs 
restructuring charges were incurred only in fiscal and were  and in industrial controls  fluid handling and analytical instrumentation  respectively 
unallocated corporate administrative costs were   and  for the years ended october   and  respectively 
includes results of abel pump from may and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented 
includes results of photometrics from april  the fiscal petroleum analyzer acquisitions from june  masd from november  antek instruments from august  struers and logitech from september and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal were million  a increase compared to fiscal excluding sales to rao gazprom gazprom  a large russian natural gas company  net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal pro forma net sales adjusted to remove exited operations increased compared to pro forma net sales during fiscal also adjusted to include the results of companies acquired during fiscal for the same length of time as included in fiscal s results 
in the analytical instrumentation segment  actual net sales increased and pro forma net sales increased 
the increase in actual net sales resulted mostly from the contribution of companies acquired during fiscal and the increase in pro forma net sales resulted mostly from strong digital imaging demand from research markets 
weakness in the automobile industry adversely affected sales of roper s high speed digital camera products and its industrial leak test products 
in the fluid handling segment  actual net sales increased and pro forma net sales decreased 
actual net sales increased primarily as the result of companies acquired over the past two years 
pro forma net sales decreased primarily as the result of depressed business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
this segment s pro forma net sales to this industry decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal roper expects these sales to be lower still in fiscal net sales in fiscal for this segment s businesses not serving the semiconductor industry increased compared to pro forma net sales in fiscal in the industrial controls segment  actual net sales increased and pro forma net sales increased 
actual net sales increased primarily as a result of companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal  increased shipments to gazprom and higher revenues from customers in energy markets 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues at petrotech that resulted from restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal pro forma net sales increased primarily as a result of additional sales to gazprom 
sales to gazprom were million during fiscal  or an increase of compared to fiscal roper s overall gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal several factors were the largest contributors to the change 
the largest factor was the growth in the analytical instrumentation segment  roper s highest gross margin segment 
other large factors contributing to increased margins were improved leverage on the additional sales to gazprom and the benefits from exiting certain low margin businesses at petrotech during adversely affecting margins were the increased sales from roper s lower margin refrigeration valves business that was acquired in september analytical instrumentation s gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal most of this improvement resulted from favorable leverage related to increased digital imaging sales and the incremental sales at struers and logitech that were at relatively high margins 
fluid handling s gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was caused mostly by lower sales of its high margin semiconductor related products 
industrial controls gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was caused primarily by the favorable effects of increased sales to gazprom and lower sales from exited businesses  and was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin refrigeration valve products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal and fiscal are presented in the following table 
total adjusted total adjusted analytical instrumentation fluid handling industrial controls corporate total excludes goodwill amortization and and restructuring charges 
the increase in sg a costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal for the fluid handling segment was caused by the adverse leverage that resulted from the quick and deep cyclical decline in the segment s semiconductor related business 
other changes in the relationships between sg a costs and net sales were not considered significant 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense was higher in fiscal mostly due to the borrowings associated with the acquisitions that occurred since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions  representing total costs of over million during these two fiscal years  were paid for with cash provided by roper s then existing credit facilities 
short term interest rates started to decline dramatically early in calendar roper s effective interest rate was approximately during fiscal compared to approximately during fiscal the provision for income taxes was of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal this change was not considered significant 
roper s other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these net assets were primarily denominated in euros or euro equivalent currencies  british pounds  danish krone or japanese yen 
during fiscal  the us dollar weakened against the euro  was relatively stable against the pound and strengthened against the yen and krone after the acquisition of danish assets in september 
during fiscal  roper s consolidated net assets increased million due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
net sales orders year ended october  pro forma pro forma actual pro forma actual change in thousands analytical instrumentation     fluid handling     industrial controls     the decrease in analytical instrumentation s pro forma net sales orders in fiscal compared to fiscal was broad based 
net sales orders for each major product group declined from 
this segment s businesses were adversely affected by poor market conditions in the automotive and semiconductor industries 
the decrease in pro forma net sales orders for the fluid handling segment was caused largely by a decline in semiconductor related orders 
the increase in pro forma net sales orders for the industrial controls segment was caused primarily by additional orders from gazprom 
sales order backlog october  pro forma pro forma actual pro forma actual change in thousands analytical instrumentation     fluid handling     industrial controls     changes in sales order backlog were consistent with changes in net sales orders 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal of million were up compared to the prior year 
excluding net sales to gazprom  net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were less than pro forma net sales for fiscal net sales for the analytical instrumentation segment increased  mostly the result of business acquisitions petroleum analyzer  masd  antek instruments and other smaller businesses 
this segment s net sales were less than the prior year s pro forma net sales largely from lower comparative sales in fluid properties test equipment markets 
net sales for the fluid handling segment increased  mostly the result of business acquisitions abel pump and other smaller businesses and a very strong fiscal for this segment s semiconductor related business 
this segment s net sales were higher than pro forma net sales for fiscal fluid handling s historical semiconductor business increased its net sales in fiscal by partly from favorable comparisons to reported net sales in the first half of fiscal and its acquired business increased its net sales by compared to the same period in the prior year 
fiscal net sales for this segment s centrifugal pump business decreased compared to the prior year due to weak agricultural and water wastewater markets 
agricultural markets were adversely impacted by widespread drought conditions and low commodity prices in the united states 
roper believes the municipal water and wastewater markets were adversely affected by resources diverted to minimize yk exposures early in fiscal  and its centrifugal pump business had increased exposure to these markets as it developed larger pumps to pursue more lucrative projects 
fluid handling s piston metering pumps business net sales were also down compared to fiscal as this company s largest customer reduced its purchases until it resolves an fda compliance problem unrelated to this company s products 
net sales for the industrial controls segment decreased less than in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal net sales were less than pro forma fiscal net sales 
the timing of this segment s primary fiscal acquisition hansen technologies in september was such that it did not significantly affect fiscal results 
this segment was significantly influenced by conditions in the exploration and production sectors of the oil gas industry 
roper believes several large oil gas business combinations early in the year delayed capital spending programs  and spending had yet to recover from the effects of relatively low oil and natural gas prices throughout much of fiscal throughout fiscal  net sales each quarter excluding sales to gazprom improved in comparison to the same quarter of fiscal whereas these first quarter net sales were down compared to the prior year  fourth quarter net sales also excluding hansen technologies were up 
net sales to gazprom of million in fiscal were comparable to fiscal net sales of million 
the gross profit percentage for the analytical instrumentation segment decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease arose mostly from the inclusion of masd for most of fiscal if masd s results were excluded from the segment s results in fiscal  the segment s gross profit percentage was 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal and fiscal are presented in the following table 
total adjusted total adjusted analytical instrumentation fluid handling industrial controls corporate total excludes goodwill amortization 
sg a expenses increased as a percentage of net sales for roper as a whole because of the increased costs in the fluid handling segment and the increased size of the analytical instrumentation segment with its relatively high level of sg a expenses compared to roper s other business segments 
sg a expenses for the fluid handling segment increased as a percentage of net sales mostly due to relatively high cost structures of recent acquisitions  particularly abel pump and flowdata 
another significant reason for this segment s increased sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales was the adverse leverage associated with the decline in the segment s centrifugal pump business combined with the added costs of this business moving into a larger facility early in fiscal other changes in the relationships between sg a costs and net sales were not considered significant 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense was higher in fiscal due primarily to the borrowings associated with the numerous acquisitions that occurred during fiscal and especially during fiscal all of these acquisitions  representing total costs of approximately million during these two fiscal years  were paid for with cash provided by roper s then existing credit facilities 
the provision for income taxes was of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate was due to several of the recent acquisitions located in relatively high income tax rate jurisdictions and the amortization of some goodwill associated with these acquisitions was not deductible for income tax purposes 
roper s other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these net assets were primarily denominated in euros  british pounds or japanese yen 
the us dollar strengthened against each of these currencies during fiscal  but especially against the euro and particularly during roper s fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  roper s consolidated net assets decreased million million in the fourth quarter due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
roper s goodwill denominated in non us currencies also decreased by million due to currency translation adjustments 
the following table summarizes roper s net sales orders and sales order backlog information in thousands 
the pro forma amounts include comparable time periods for those companies acquired during fiscal net sales orders sales order backlog year ended october  october  actual pro forma actual actual pro forma actual analytical instrumentation       fluid handling       industrial controls       the increase in analytical instrumentation s net sales orders in fiscal compared to fiscal pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to an increase in the segment s digital imaging businesses and a increase in its spectroscopy business which was influenced by the strong semiconductor industry 
the increase in fluid handling s net sales orders in fiscal compared to fiscal pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to continued strength in the segment s semiconductor related businesses  whose net sales orders increased financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by million at october  compared to million at october  total debt was million at october  of total capital compared to million at october  of total capital 
roper s increased debt and increased financial leverage at october  compared to that a year ago was due to the additional borrowings incurred to fund fiscal business acquisitions 
roper s principal million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of its daily external financing requirements  consisting of revolving loans  swing line loans and letters of credit 
at october   utilization of this facility included million of us denominated borrowings  the equivalent of million of non us denominated borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit 
total unused availability under this facility was million at october  this facility matures may roper also has a number of smaller facilities in various non us locations to support the businesses in these locations 
roper s outstanding indebtedness at october  also included million of term notes 
one set of notes totaling million matures may the other set of notes totaling million matures may neither set of notes requires sinking fund payments 
roper may prepay either set of notes by paying the holders thereof the discounted present value of all remaining scheduled payments using a discount rate equal to a risk free rate plus a margin 
although the excess of current assets over current liabilities at october  and were similar  roper acquired approximately million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal reductions in net current assets were attributed to improved management of accounts receivable  inventories and payables 
capital expenditures were million during fiscal compared to the million incurred during fiscal in november  roper s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on its outstanding common stock to per share from per share  an increase of 
this represents the ninth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since roper s initial public offering 
roper s board of directors has declared a dividend payable on january  payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors 
roper believes that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under its various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although roper maintains an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on roper s activities  financial condition and results of operations 
roper may also explore alternatives to increase its access to additional capital resources 
roper anticipates that its recently acquired companies as well as its other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which roper historically has experienced 
however  the rate at which roper can reduce its debt during fiscal and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of its existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty 
recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas business combinations that applies to all business combinations completed subsequent to june  sfas requires use of the purchase method for accounting for a business combination 
other provisions of sfas must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of sfas roper does not expect the full adoption of sfas to significantly affect its accounting for any business combinations completed prior to june  the fasb issued sfas goodwill and other intangible assets that roper intends to adopt effective november  otherwise  adoption would be required on november  
once adopted  this standard provides that goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization 
instead  goodwill will be subjected to a periodic analysis to evaluate possible impairment 
any such impairment would be recognized as an expense immediately 
the fasb issued sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations that roper is required to adopt by november  roper does not currently have  nor is it expected to have  any material asset retirement obligations subject to this new standard 
the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets that roper is required to adopt by november  this new standard does not apply to goodwill 
roper does not expect the adoption of this standard to result in an impairment charge 
outlook fiscal is expected to be another record year for sales and earnings 
fiscal is expected to benefit from the full year contributions from the businesses acquired during fiscal  especially struers and logitech 
fiscal earnings would also benefit from the adoption of sfas goodwill amortization was million during fiscal the conditions in the semiconductor industry are currently poor and roper expects its product sales into this industry to be lower in fiscal than they were in on a pro forma basis 
roper does not expect this industry to show any significant signs of improvement before at least the second half of the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  and the aftereffects related thereto still cast a significant cloud of uncertainty over the near term health of the economy in the united states and elsewhere 
the us economy was also showing signs of weakening prior to the september attacks 
it is impossible to isolate each of these factor s effects on current economic conditions 
it is also impossible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what or when any additional events may occur that also will similarly disrupt the economy 
roper expects to continue an active acquisition program 
however  completion of future acquisitions and their impact on roper s results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted 
forward looking information the information provided elsewhere in this annual report  in roper s filings with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases and in other public disclosures contains forward looking statements about roper s businesses and prospects 
these forward looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  foresee  likely  will or other similar words or phrases 
similarly  statements that describe roper s objectives  plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which generally are beyond roper s control and which may cause roper s actual results  performance or achievements to be different from any future results  performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements 
some of these risks include the level and the timing of future business with gazprom and other eastern european customers and their ability to obtain financing  changes in interest and currency exchange rates  market conditions including the duration and extent of the current economic recession  the continued success of roper s cost reduction efforts  the future operating results of newly acquired companies and consequences stemming from the september terrorist activities 
there is no assurance that these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on roper s future operations  financial condition  or financial results 
roper does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk roper is exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings 
it is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on its transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
it is also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of its common stock 
at october   roper had a combination of fixed rate borrowings primarily million of term notes and relatively variable rate borrowings primarily borrowings under the million credit facility 
although each borrowing under the million credit facility has a fixed rate  the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only months 
at october   interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term notes 
this resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes being greater than the face amounts of the notes 
roper estimated this difference to be million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in roper s net assets at october  if interest rates had been higher  the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have decreased to million 
at october   roper s outstanding variable rate borrowings under the million credit facility were million 
an increase in interest rates of would increase roper s annualized interest costs by  several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros or equivalent currencies  british pounds  danish krone or japanese yen 
sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were of roper s total sales 
the us dollar was mixed against these currencies during fiscal comparing currency exchange rates at october  to october   the dollar weakened against the euro  was flat against the pound and strengthened against yen 
the dollar strengthened against the krone over the last two months of fiscal these exchange rate changes had an immaterial impact on sales and earnings during fiscal excluding the effects of any future acquisitions  the percentage of non us dollar denominated sales is expected to be higher in fiscal in the changes of these currencies relative to the us dollar during fiscal also resulted in an increase in net assets of million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 
this change is believed to have a minimal impact on expected future cash flows 
the traded price of roper s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in roper s financial statements 
the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share 
certain cash compensation arrangements are also directly related to roper s stock price 
the stock price also affects roper s employees perceptions of various roper programs that involve its common stock
