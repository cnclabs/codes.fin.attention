item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on the information available at the time and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
we believe that significant estimates  assumptions and judgments affect the following critical accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our audit committee has reviewed their selection  application and disclosure 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from patent and technology license and royalty fees 
since these revenues result from our representation agreements with owners and assignees of intellectual property rights  we record revenues net of the owners and assignees shares of license and royalty fees 
we stipulate the terms of our licensing arrangements in written agreements with the owners  assignees and licensees 
single element arrangements since we usually have no significant obligations after we execute license agreements  they are generally single element arrangements 
under the terms of our license agreements  we generally receive an upfront license fee and a royalty stream based on the licensee s sales of products applying the licensed technology 
license fees under single element arrangements we recognize upfront  nonrefundable license fees when our licensee executes the license agreement and pays the license fee 
when these two events occur  we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no continuing obligations  completed delivery  and assurance of collection 
royalty fees under single element arrangements although we fix the royalty rate eg  percentage of sales or rate per unit sold in the license agreement  the amount of earned royalties is contingent upon the amount of licensed product the licensee sells 
royalties earned in each reporting period are contingent on the outcome of events ie  the licensee s sales of licensed products occurring within that period that are not within our control and are not directly tied to our providing services 
therefore  we recognize this royalty revenue when the contingency is resolved and we can estimate the amount of royalty fees earned  which is upon our receipt of the licensee s royalty report 
other arrangements in limited instances  we enter into multiple element arrangements with continuing service obligations 
based upon the limited verifiable objective evidence available  we generally defer all revenue from such multiple element arrangements until we deliver all elements 
in limited instances  we enter into milestone billing arrangements  which we evaluate on a case by case basis 
in these arrangements  we generally defer upfront fees and recognize the related revenue and other services revenue as earned over the entire arrangement 
impairment of intangible assets and long term investments we review intangible assets and investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss measured by the amount the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value and re evaluate the remaining useful life of the asset 
if a quoted market price is available for the asset or a similar asset  we use it in determining fair value 
if not  we determine fair value as the present value of estimated cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
we applied this policy to our  investment in and  advance to micro asi  inc and recorded a  impairment charge in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a  recovery of our advance 
we cannot predict the timing or amounts of potential additional recoveries  therefore we will record further recoveries  if any  when we can estimate their timing and amounts 
we also applied this policy to our  investment of services in digital ink  inc we discuss this application in results of operations for fiscal below 
we regularly apply this policy to our equity investments in privately held companies principally  in ntru cryptosystems  inc at july  
we consider the investee s financial health including cash position  business outlook including product stage and viability to continue operations  recent funding activities  and business plan including historical and forecast financial information 
in the future  we could be required to write down our investments because of adverse changes in these or other factors 
these investments are not readily transferable and our opportunities to liquidate them are limited and subject to many factors beyond our control  including circumstances internal to the investee and broader economic conditions 
we also apply this policy to all acquired intangible assets 
at july   certain of our acquired licenses stopped producing revenues and certain of our acquired patents are no longer expected to generate revenues in the future 
for each technology  we compared the estimated future revenues with the carrying value at july  for those technologies with a carrying value greater than estimated future revenues  we recorded total impairment charges of  in other costs of technology management services in fiscal after recording this impairment charge  we also reviewed the estimated useful lives of the remaining intangible assets 
as a result  we reduced the average remaining useful life from to approximately years and expect to record amortization expense of approximately  for fiscal  compared with  for each fiscal year ending july   and impairment of loans we review loans for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the loan may not be recoverable 
we determine the present value of expected future cash flows under the loan discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the fair value of the loan is less than its carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss based on the fair value of the loan 
this policy is consistent with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of statements no 
and we applied this policy to our  of notes receivable from e

we discuss the results of this application more fully below 
results of operations vs 
our total revenues for fiscal were  which was  lower than for fiscal for fiscal  retained royalties were  which was  lower than for fiscal in fiscal  approximately  of our retained royalties were from four technologies  from gallium arsenide patents including a laser diode technology used in optoelectronic storage devices and another technology that improves semiconductor operating characteristics   from ethyoltm a chemotherapeutic mitigation agent   from the vitamin b assay  and  from the homocysteine assay 
retained royalties from the gallium arsenide semiconductor inventions which include laser diode applications for fiscal were approximately  compared with approximately  for fiscal  a decline of approximately  
this reflects lower telecom industry sales partially offset by higher dvd product sales 
due to uncertainties in the markets for products using these inventions  we cannot predict whether our royalties which are based on our licensees sales of licensed products will continue to decline or begin to increase  nor can we predict whether  if an increase were to occur  our royalties would return to the level 
most of our royalties from these inventions are reported semi annually in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
retained royalties were also lower because a licensee which had previously been paying  minimum pre market annual retained royalties in prior fiscal years terminated its license and therefore paid no minimum in fiscal also lower were retained royalties from homocysteine and expiring vitamin b assay patents our last vitamin b assay patent expires in november 
a homocysteine licensee that had been paying certain royalties in fiscal began withholding those royalties in fiscal  taking a position similar to labcorp s position 
we believe that the december judgment of the us district court for the district of colorado confirms that our patent rights are valid 
based on that judgment  we believe that we are entitled to royalties on all homocysteine assays performed by our licensees 
however  there can be no assurance that we will ultimately prevail 
retained royalty increases from other technologies partially offset these reductions 
royalties from ethyol in fiscal increased approximately  over fiscal ethyol s royalty base is higher since october when the licensee began selling ethyol directly in the united states rather than through a distributor 
we expect our retained royalties from ethyol to reach our  per year maximum in fiscal other increases included higher minimum royalties on licenses of our sunless tanning technology and a treatment for sexual dysfunction  one time royalties from a retin atm royalty audit and earned royalties from a new license in licensees of our endoscopic ligator have withheld royalties since the third quarter of fiscal our retained royalties from the endoscopic ligator were approximately  for fiscal we believe we are entitled to all withheld and future royalties for use of our patented technology 
however  we cannot predict when  if ever  licensees will resume remitting royalties for this technology 
we believe that a supreme court decision voids our licensees arguments that their products are not using our patented technology 
this decision upheld earlier decisions that a patent s scope is not limited to its literal terms  but embraces all equivalents to the claims described and puts the burden of proof on the patentee to show that the equivalents at issue have not been surrendered 
according to patent law  an equivalent uses substantially the same invention in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result 
we continue to pursue collection of these royalties through non judicial means 
other changes in retained royalty revenues reflect changes in the timing of royalties reported by licensees and in licensees sales of licensed products 
historically  the company s royalty revenues in its second and fourth fiscal quarters have been higher than in its first and third fiscal quarters 
total operating expenses for fiscal were  compared with  in fiscal while personnel  recruiting and corporate legal expenses were higher in fiscal  patent enforcement net of reimbursements and consultants fees and expenses were lower 
intangible asset impairment charges were approximately  in fiscal in fiscal we employed people full time equivalents compared with in fiscal we hired john b 
nano as our president and chief executive officer in june  increased our professional staff and reduced consultants compared with fiscal recruiting expenses in fiscal to search for a new president and chief executive officer were higher than those for professional staff hired in fiscal corporate legal expenses were higher due in part to legal expenses related to an sec investigation  including those of a director samuel m 
fodale pursuant to our june  legal expense reimbursement agreement see exhibit to our annual report on form k for the year ended july  and increased legal services related to certain contractual matters with a client 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  in fiscal were  lower than in fiscal patent enforcement expenses are principally for outside litigation counsels services in the three patent litigations fujitsu  labcorp and maternatm  two of which were active in fiscal in which our clients and or we have sued to enforce their and our patent rights 
the level of activity in these two cases was lower in fiscal than in fiscal we have included details of progress and status in these three cases in note to consolidated financial statements 
effective july   we agreed with the university of illinois  our client  that the university would take the lead and assume the cost of new lead counsel in the litigation against fujitsu 
before this agreement  ctt bore the entire costs of lead counsel in this litigation 
we expect this agreement to reduce our net patent enforcement expenses substantially in fiscal ctt retains its economic interest in the potential favorable outcome of this case 
on october   the company signed a contingent promissory note payable to our patent litigation counsel for approximately  plus simple interest at the annual rate of from the agreement date payable only from future receipts in a settlement or other favorable outcome of the litigation against fujitsu  if any 
since patent litigation counsel had not agreed to these revised payment terms at july   our accounts payable at july   included these invoices 
accordingly  we will reverse approximately  from accounts payable and operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal we paid a client  as reimbursement of certain of our previously deducted patent enforcement expenses 
we included this charge in patent enforcement expenses 
if and when the related enforcement action is settled  we are entitled to reimbursement of these and additional litigation expenses we have then incurred from any recovery we receive as a result of the litigation and from subsequent income from the related patents 
other costs of technology management services for fiscal were  which was  higher than for fiscal this increase reflects increased costs related to licensing and retained royalties and new client development  principally personnel and related expenses 
it also includes approximately  of intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal see note to consolidated financial statements 
we have reclassified consulting expenses directly related to technology management from general and administration expenses in fiscal to conform to the classification in fiscal general and administration expenses for fiscal were  which was  lower than in fiscal higher corporate legal and recruiting expenses partially offset lower consultants fees and expenses 
other income loss  net effective august   ctt sold and transferred all its interests related to e 
l 
specialists  inc to mrm acquisitions  llc for  cash 
as a result of this transaction  ctt wrote down its  notes receivable from els to their fair value of  which it collected on august  in fiscal ctt incurred a total  impairment loss on loans to els  and  in the second and fourth quarters  respectively  and charged against other revenues approximately  deemed uncollectible see note to consolidated financial statements 
because of digital ink  inc s dii inability to arrange financial support to continue its operations  ctt recorded an impairment loss of  to write off of our equity investment in dii in the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal and  ctt provided patenting  marketing and accounting services in exchange for its  equity in dii 
in the third quarter of fiscal  ctt recorded a recovery of  of its secured bridge financing advances to micro asi  inc at july   ctt reduced its carrying value for all its investments and advances to micro asi to zero because of micro asi s bankruptcy filing in august we are unable to predict the timing or amount of ctt s potential future recoveries of its advances to micro asi  if any see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest income of  for fiscal was  lower than in fiscal our average invested balance was approximately lower and our weighted average interest rate was approximately per annum compared with approximately per annum in fiscal other expenses in fiscal were legal expenses incurred in connection with a suit brought against ctt  some of its subsidiaries and directors

results of operations vs 
retained royalties for fiscal were   higher than retained royalties of  in fiscal retained royalties from the gallium arsenide semiconductor inventions  which include laser diode applications  were approximately  in fiscal  an increase of approximately  
this increase resulted principally from increased sales of licensed products 
retained royalties in fiscal included approximately  for a homocysteine licensee s increase in its previously estimated royalties for through homocysteine retained royalties in both fiscal years were reduced by a sublicensee s withholding royalties on certain tests 
the company has joined with its licensee in a lawsuit against the sublicensee as detailed in note to consolidated financial statements 
retained royalties from the vitamin b assay in fiscal were approximately  compared with approximately  in fiscal certain of these licensed patents expired in april  april  february and may in fiscal  retained royalty revenues on our endoscopic ligator were less than  and approximately  lower than in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a retained royalty settlement of  for the estimated fair value of the royalty participation we exchanged for  shares of ntru cryptosystems  inc ntru common stock valued at per share 
we had no similar royalty settlement in fiscal other revenues under fee for service contracts for fiscal were  lower than in fiscal many of these contracts were one time arrangements unique to a particular client at a particular time 
total operating expenses for fiscal were  compared with  for fiscal patent enforcement expenses net of reimbursements  recruiting fees in connection with hiring additional technology commercialization professionals and consultants fees and expenses increased more than personnel and related expenses declined 
we employed people full time equivalents in fiscal compared with people full time equivalents in fiscal we supplemented our full time staff with consultants in certain matters 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  were  higher in fiscal than in fiscal these costs exclude personnel costs related to our enforcement activities  which are included in other costs of technology management services discussed below 
we were involved in three litigations fujitsu  labcorp and materna in which our clients and or we sued to enforce our patent rights 
other costs of technology management services were  in fiscal and  in fiscal we have reclassified consulting expenses directly related to technology management from general and administration expenses in fiscal and to conform to the classification in fiscal increases in costs related to licensing and retained royalties and new client development were partially offset by a reduction in costs related to fee for service contracts 
general and administration expenses for fiscal were  higher than in fiscal increases in recruiting fees and consultants fees and expenses related to potential acquisitions we considered but did not consummate more than offset reductions in personnel and related expenses 
interest income of  for fiscal was  higher than in fiscal our average invested balances were higher and our weighted average interest rate was approximately the same as in fiscal during fiscal  ctt sold available for sale securities and realized gains of  that were included in other income 
there were no such sales in fiscal financial condition and liquidity at july   cash and cash equivalents of  were  higher than cash and cash equivalents of  at july  operating activities used  and investing activities provided  in fiscal in addition  the company held  in short term investments at july  compared with  at july  these investments are available for our current operating  investing and financing needs 
the company s net loss for fiscal included non cash charges of approximately  comprising approximately  for depreciation and amortization  approximately  for stock compensation  approximately  of intangible asset impairment   of loan impairment loss   of investment impairment loss  and  recovery of advances to micro asi  inc in general  changes in various operating accounts result from changes in the timing and amounts of cash flows before and after the end of the period 
the most substantial changes in operating accounts were the  decrease in royalties receivable  the  increase in accounts payable  the  decrease in royalties payable and the  decrease in accrued professional fees 
in addition to fluctuations in the amounts of royalties reported  the changes in royalties receivable and payable reflect the company s normal cycle of royalty collections and payments 
the changes in accounts payable and accrued professional fees were principally related to patent enforcement expenses 
during fiscal  the company sold  of short term investments at book value to support operating and other investing activities described below 
in august  ctt acquired shares of ntru series b convertible preferred stock for  in cash as part of a million financing round 
after this round of financing  ctt held approximately of ntru s outstanding combined preferred and common equity 
at various times between august  and april   ctt loaned additional amounts totaling  in cash and  in services to els under bridge financing agreements which increased the loans outstanding to  after recording a loan impairment loss of  against its notes receivable from els  on july  ctt carried the notes as current assets at  which it collected on august  our strategy going forward will not include such investments where we would be a primary or lead investor 
at july   the company had no outstanding commitments for capital expenditures and no outstanding debt or available credit facility 
at july   we had net working capital of  approximately  less than at july  our accounts payable at july   include approximately  of patent litigation counsel s invoices we will not pay except from future receipts in a settlement or other favorable outcome of the litigation against fujitsu  if any 
on october   the company signed a contingent promissory note payable to our patent litigation counsel for approximately  plus simple interest at the annual rate of from the agreement date payable only from future receipts in a settlement or other favorable outcome of the litigation against fujitsu  if any 
accordingly  we will reverse approximately  from accounts payable and operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal  thereby reducing the company s working capital requirements 
in addition  as a result of our agreement for the university of illinois to assume the costs of lead counsel in the litigation against fujitsu  we expect substantially lower patent enforcement expenses in fiscal based on our current expectations  including the actions discussed in the preceding paragraph  we anticipate that currently available funds and expected revenues will be sufficient to finance cash needs for our current operating and enforcement activities into fiscal we are  however  considering opportunities to increase our cash resources 
specifically  we have engaged an investment banking firm to assist us in raising debt and or equity funds to execute our strategic plan 
in addition  we are evaluating an opportunity to monetize a portion of our interest in the materna judgment prior to its final resolution on appeal 
we will carefully evaluate the economic costs and benefits of any transaction of this nature 
we intend to monitor our operating and enforcement costs closely and reduce them  if necessary  to meet these expectations 
however  royalty revenues  costs of enforcement actions and expansion of our business are subject to many factors outside our control or that we cannot currently anticipate  including without limitation business opportunities that may arise in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our current expectations regarding the sufficiency of currently available funds and expected revenues will prove to be accurate 
at july   ctt s shareholders interest was  under american stock exchange amex listing standards  if ctt sustains a net loss in fiscal and has less than  shareholders interest at july   the amex may consider suspending dealings in or delisting ctt s common stock 
in october  we engaged investment bankers to assist us in raising additional debt or equity funds to execute our strategic plan 
in addition  we are pursuing additional strategies to leverage our core licensing competencies and generate near term revenues 
we expect the results of these efforts  together with the benefits of our july  agreement with the university of illinois and our october  agreement with patent litigation counsel discussed above  to keep ctt within the amex listing standards  but we cannot assure you that we will achieve our expectations
