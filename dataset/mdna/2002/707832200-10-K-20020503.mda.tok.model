the company believes the following to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions reserve for store closures for closed stores and stores which the company has decided to close  the company records a liability for the estimated future cash flows including future lease commitments  net of estimated cost recoveries and miscellaneous closing costs 
future cash flows are estimated based on the company s knowledge of the market in which the stores closed or to be closed are located 
these estimates of future cash flows could be affected by changes in real estate markets and other economic conditions 
impairment of long lived assets at each fiscal year end  the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment based on projected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  such assets are written down to their fair value 
in projecting future cash flows  management considers historical performance and assessments of the effect  among other things  of projected changes in competition  maturation of new stores and store remodels  merchandising and marketing strategies and general market conditions 
the determination of fair values is based upon management s knowledge of local real estate markets and the value of equipment utilized in the supermarket industry 
no assurance can be given that the actual future cash flows will be sufficient to recover the carrying value of long lived assets 
liability for self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  general liability and certain group health and welfare costs 
self insurance liabilities are actuarially calculated based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses concerning these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to factors such as claim settlement patterns  litigation trends  legal interpretations and future levels of health care costs 
employee benefit plans the actuarial determination of penn traffic s obligations and expense for company sponsored pension benefits is dependent on the company s selection of assumptions including the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of compensation increase 
significant differences between penn traffic s actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense
