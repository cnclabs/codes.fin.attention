item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
the statements contained in this report regarding our future financial and operating performance and results  business strategy and market prices and future hedging activities  and other statements  including  in particular statements about our plans and forecasts under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business  that are not historical facts are forward looking statements  as defined in section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of among these forward looking statements are statements regarding our anticipated performance in the year  specifically statements relating to our net sales  gross profit  production  general and administrative expenses  production costs  and capital expenditures 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current assumptions  expectations and projections about future events 
we use the words may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  believe  continue  intend  plan  budget  or other similar words to identify forward looking statements 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or of our financial conditions  and or state other forward looking information 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements 
these statements also involve risks and uncertainties  that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our expectations in this report  including  but not limited to estimates of reserves  market factors  market prices including regional basis differentials of oil and natural gas  results of future drilling  marketing activity  future production and costs  and other factors discussed in this report and in our other sec filings 
we believe that it is important to communicate our expectations of future performance to our investors 
however  events may occur in the future that we are unable to accurately predict  or over which we have no control 
when considering our forward looking statements  keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this annual report 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
declines in oil or natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil or natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil or natural gas that we can produce economically 
current oil and natural gas prices have declined significantly during and at december  from the historically high levels at december  the valuations and estimated quantities of our oil and natural gas reserves at december   in this annual report are based upon these lower prices 
oil and natural gas prices at their current level  or a further decline in oil and or natural gas prices  could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and estimated quantities of our oil and natural gas reserves  our ability to fund our operations and our financial condition  cash flow  results of operations and access to capital 
historically  oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
performance the year ended december   was a very active year with respect to the implementation of our business strategy 
during the year  we completed acquisitions for net consideration of approximately million and spent approximately million on development and exploitation activities 
our acquisitions added approximately bcfe of proved reserves  resulting in an acquisition cost of per mcfe 
our largest acquisition during the year was the purchase of addison energy inc  which also marked our entry into canada 
our reserves grew by from bcfe at december   to bcfe at december  in june  we raised million million net after fees and commissions through a rights offering to our existing shareholders 
we applied approximately million of the proceeds to repay our bank loans 
at year end  we had approximately million of long term debt outstanding  resulting in a debt to book capitalization ratio of 
at december   we had approximately million of long term debt outstanding  with a debt to book capitalization ratio of 
we had a total of approximately million available for borrowing under our us and canadian credit agreements at december  our production grew by from bcfe in to bcfe in  as a result of our acquisition  development and exploitation activities 
during  we experienced a general decline in the prices we received for oil  natural gas and ngls 
our realized oil price  before hedge settlements  declined from an average of per bbl during the first quarter to an average of per bbl during the fourth quarter 
our realized natural gas price  before hedge settlements  declined from an average of per mcf during the first quarter to an average of per mcf during the fourth quarter 
our realized ngls price declined from an average of per bbl during the first quarter to an average of per bbl during the fourth quarter 
production costs  including production and ad valorem taxes  increased on a per mcfe basis from in to in mainly as a result of workovers and equipment repairs during the first six months of relating to production enhancement projects on the central resources properties we acquired on september   and the inclusion of production costs for the full year from these properties which have higher historic average per unit costs 
during  we experienced a general decline in our per unit production costs 
our production costs  including production and ad valorem taxes  declined from an average of per mcfe during the first quarter to an average of per mcfe during the fourth quarter 
we also recorded non cash income and expense items related to our hedging activities as well as non cash write offs of our oil and natural gas properties as further described in our results of operations comparison of years ended december  and below 
outlook commodity prices during  commodity prices declined from historically high levels at the beginning of the year to more moderate levels by year end 
our outlook for commodity prices is uncertain 
significant factors that will impact commodity prices include the extent to which members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas  the overall north american natural gas supply and demand fundamentals and the extent of any worldwide economic recovery  especially any economic recovery in the united states 
political events and turmoil in the middle east as well as the us war on terrorism may exacerbate commodity price volatility 
we will continue to moderate our debt levels  follow cost management measures and strategically hedge oil and natural price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our oil  natural gas and ngls 
we will continue to review our hedge position each time we make a material acquisition 
as of december   we had a hedge in place covering  bbls of our oil production under a swap contract with a weighted average fixed price to be received of per bbl 
we have hedged approximately of our forecasted oil production for we also had hedges in place covering  mmbtus of natural gas production under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price to be received of per mmbtu 
in march  we increased our commodity hedge positions by entering into a hedge covering  mmbtus of natural gas per month with a fixed price to be received of per mmbtu  beginning in may through the end of with this increase in our natural gas hedge positions  we have hedged approximately of our forecasted natural gas production for we also entered into a hedge covering  mmbtus of natural gas per month for all of with a fixed price to be received of per mmbtu 
additionally  at december   we had approximately million remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to our terminated hedge contracts with enron north america 
of this amount  approximately million will be reclassified into earnings during and the balance of approximately million will be reclassified into earnings in for more information regarding our hedging contracts as well as the accounting treatment of the terminated enron hedges  please review item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
first quarter based on our current estimates  we expect that our first quarter production will be between bcfe and bcfe 
we expect first quarter production costs  including production and ad valorem taxes  to average between to per mcfe 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is expected to be between to per mcfe and general and administrative expense is expected to be between million and million during the first quarter of our interest expense is expected to be between  and  production growth we currently forecast that our annual production will be between bcfe and bcfe 
this estimate includes approximately bcfe to bcfe of production related to our pending canadian acquisition which is expected to close in april for purposes of this forecast we have assumed that the pending canadian acquisition closes in april if this transaction is delayed or terminated  this forecast could differ materially from our actual results 
acquisitions and capital expenditures for  we have budgeted up to million for development efforts plus related facilities 
approximately of our capital budget is allocated to the us and approximately is allocated to canada 
our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil  natural gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions 
should our price expectations for our future production or rig availability change sufficiently  we may accelerate some projects or defer some projects and  consequently  may increase or decrease total and future capital expenditures 
in addition  if the actual costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts  actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 
we plan to fund our pending canadian acquisition from borrowings under our current credit agreements 
although we have completed several major property acquisitions in recent years  these transactions are opportunity driven 
thus  we do not budget  nor can we reasonably predict  the timing or size of any acquisitions we do not describe in this report 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to our proved reserve estimates  impairment assessments  functional currency assessment  deferred tax asset valuations and our choice of accounting method 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
proved reserve estimates estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by our independent petroleum engineers 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  then the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  reducing net income 
a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill or produce from higher cost fields 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our oil and gas properties for impairment 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties we periodically assess individually significant unproved oil and natural gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
our assessment of the results of exploitation activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or the expiration of all or a portion of the leases for potential projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions 
assessments of functional currencies we determine the functional currencies of our subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues  costs and expenses 
we have determined that the canadian dollar is the functional currency of our international operations in canada 
the assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position 
deferred tax asset valuations we periodically assess the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on our assessment of future earnings outlooks by tax jurisdiction 
these estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions are utilized in the assessments that may prove to be incorrect in the future 
accounting for oil and natural gas properties the accounting for and disclosure of oil and natural gas producing activities requires that we choose between gaap alternatives and to make judgments about estimates of future uncertainties 
we use the full cost method of accounting  which involves capitalizing all acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development costs 
once incurred  costs are recorded in the full cost pool or in unevaluated properties 
unevaluated property costs are not subject to depletion 
we review our unevaluated costs on an ongoing basis  and we expect these costs to be evaluated in one to three years and transferred to the full cost pool during that time 
we calculate depletion using the unit of production method 
under this method  the sum of the full cost pool and all estimated future development costs is divided by the total amount of proved reserves 
this rate is applied to our total production for the period  and the appropriate expense is recorded 
we capitalize the portion of general and administrative costs that are attributable to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
to the extent that total capitalized oil and natural gas property costs net of related deferred income taxes and accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization exceeds the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using current period end prices discounted at  adjusted for related income tax effects  and the lower of cost and fair value of unproved properties  excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or natural gas prices increase 
we could be required to write down our oil and gas properties if there is a decline in oil or natural gas prices  or downward adjustments are made to our proved reserves 
recently issued accounting standards effective january   we adopted sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  which established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results from the hedged item on the income statement 
companies must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
to date  we have only used cash flow hedges related to our anticipated production 
for derivatives classified as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of any change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge is immediately recognized as earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured quarterly based on the relative fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
at adoption  we recognized a net derivative liability and a reduction in other comprehensive income of approximately million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change for all cash flow hedges 
oil and natural gas revenues include net gains from the settlement of cash flow hedges of million for the year ended december   and net losses of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized million in other income for hedging ineffectiveness 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations completed after june  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses  among other things  the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill subsequent to an acquisition 
the new standard eliminates the requirement to amortize acquired goodwill  instead  such goodwill shall be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted on january  we do not believe the adoption of these provisions will impact our financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which was also issued by the fasb in june  requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes other accounting pronouncements to eliminate certain exceptions and alternatives 
we do not believe the adoption of these provisions will impact our financial statements

our revenues from the sale of oil  natural gas and ngls for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million from million for this increase resulted primarily from production increases of approximately  bbls of oil  bcf of natural gas and  bbls of ngls from our acquisition of the stb energy properties  completed in march  and addison  completed in april additionally  our acquisition of the central resources properties  completed in september  was included for the full year in  as compared to four months during the increase in revenues was also attributable to higher natural gas prices which were partially offset by lower oil and ngl prices 
our average oil  natural gas and ngl prices include the effects of quality  gathering and transportation costs as well as the effect of monthly oil and natural gas hedge settlements 
our average oil price received during was per bbl as compared to per bbl for  which decreased revenue by million 
our average natural gas price received during was per mcf as compared to per mcf for  which increased revenue by million 
our average ngls price received during was per bbl as compared to per bbl for  which decreased revenue by  our other income for was million as compared to million for this income primarily consisted of income from derivative ineffectiveness  income from hedges terminated prior to their expiration  interest income  salt water disposal income and well supervision fees 
the increase in other income was primarily attributable to million from the ineffectiveness of derivative contracts and million in income from hedges that we terminated prior to their expiration 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for a discussion of the accounting for terminated hedges in future periods 
costs and expenses 
our total costs and expenses for increased by million to million from million for this increase was mainly attributable to our acquisitions of the central resources properties  the stb energy properties and addison the non cash ceiling test limitation write down of million  and the write off of million  which represents of the value  as of november   of the enron derivative assets 
our oil and natural gas production costs for increased by million  or  to million from million for our acquisitions of the stb energy properties and addison increased oil and natural gas production costs by million 
production and ad valorem taxes for increased by million  or  to million from million last year 
additionally  oil and natural gas production costs and production and ad valorem taxes related to our acquisition of the central resources properties were included for the full year  as compared to four months during our depreciation  depletion and amortization costs for increased by million  or  to million from million for our acquisitions of the stb energy properties and addison increased depreciation  depletion and amortization costs by million 
additionally  depreciation  depletion and amortization costs related to our acquisition of the central resources properties were included for the full year  as compared to four months during our general and administrative costs for increased by million  or  to million from million for the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to our increased staffing needs as a result of our acquisitions of the central resources properties  the stb energy properties and addison 
our interest expense for increased to million from million for this increase was primarily attributable to relatively high debt levels following the acquisitions of the stb energy properties and addison during the first half of the year 
these borrowings were repaid in june from the proceeds of the convertible preferred stock offering 
we acquired addison in april and we also completed significant property acquisitions during the second half of and during oil and natural gas prices trended higher throughout and were at historically high levels at december  during  oil and natural gas prices decreased throughout most of the year 
we evaluate acquisitions utilizing our best estimate of product prices and the amount of capital expenditures and operating expense to be incurred over the life of the reserves 
under full cost accounting rules  we must compare the amount in our full cost pools separate pools exist for the united states and canada to a ceiling test limit 
the ceiling test limit is calculated using product prices as of the last day of the fiscal quarter 
capital expenditures and operating expenses are calculated without any escalation for inflation 
as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices at the end of both the third and fourth quarters of  we had non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties of million  of which million was from our united states full cost pool and million was from our canadian full cost pool 
at december   we used a realized oil price of per bbl  natural gas price of per mcf and an ngls price of per bbl as the basis for determining the value of our reserves 
we did not use our hedge contracts in determining reserve values 
if product prices decline from the december  levels  it is probable that we will incur additional non cash ceiling test write downs in the future 
in connection with the incurrence of debt related to our acquisition activities and to protect against commodity price fluctuations  management adopted a policy of hedging oil and natural gas prices through the use of commodity futures  options and swap agreements 
during and through the third quarter of  we entered into several hedging contracts with enron north america 
as a result of the failure of enron north america to make payments due us in december  we terminated all of our hedging contracts with enron north america 
prior to this termination  enron north america and its parent  enron corp  filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states code 
we believe  based upon oil and natural gas prices on the date of termination  that we were owed approximately million  including settlements already due  but the exact amount will be determined pursuant to the terms of the isda master agreement 
as of november   we had recorded a million derivative asset for oil and natural gas hedge derivatives from enron north america 
this amount  calculated in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  represents the estimated value of future monthly settlements to be received from the derivatives contracts 
as a result of our termination of the derivatives contracts and the bankruptcy of the counterparty  we must record the derivative asset related to the oil and natural gas hedge derivatives from enron north america at their estimated fair value 
there currently exists an informal market for enron north america s bankruptcy claims 
based upon informal offers that we have received from third parties attempting to purchase these claims  management currently believes the fair value of the derivative asset was approximately million 
as a result  we have written off to expense million of the derivative asset for oil and natural gas hedge derivatives from enron north america 
see item business developments during we terminated our existing hedge agreements and entered into new hedge agreements and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risk for additional information concerning our hedging transactions 
our effective tax rate in was 
in  the effective rate was less than due to the ceiling test write down and write off of the enron derivative asset 
we could not utilize our net loss in the us because it is uncertain whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax asset resulting from the ceiling test write downs and the write off of the enron derivative asset 
the resulting valuation allowance of million at december   should significantly reduce income tax expense in the us going forward until such time as the net deferred tax asset position is fully realized or conditions warrant a reduction in the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance will have no effect on future canadian income tax expense

our liquidity  capital resources and capital commitments general most of our growth has resulted from recent acquisitions and the success of our drilling program 
consistent with our strategy of acquiring and developing reserves  we have an objective of maintaining financing flexibility 
in the past  we have utilized a variety of sources of capital to fund our acquisition  development and exploitation programs and to fund our operations 
our general financial strategy is to use a combination of cash flow from operations  bank financing and the sale or issuance of equity securities to fund our operations  conduct development and exploitation activities and to fund acquisitions 
we do not have a set budget for acquisitions as these tend to be opportunity driven 
historically  we have used the proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and borrowings under our credit agreements to raise cash to fund acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that funds will be available to us in the future to meet our budgeted capital spending or to fund acquisitions 
furthermore  our ability to borrow other than under our credit agreements is subject to restrictions imposed by our lenders 
if we cannot secure additional funds for our planned development and exploitation activities or for future acquisitions  then we will be required to delay or reduce substantially these activities 
during  we increased our long term debt by to approximately million at december  we generated cash flow from operations before changes in working capital in of approximately million which helped fund our acquisition  development and exploitation activities 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents balances decreased versus december  working capital at december  was lower than at december  these decreases are due to the effect of our acquisition and development activities during acquisitions and capital expenditures during  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of addison  which is headquartered in calgary  alberta  canada 
after adjustments for working capital and long term debt  we paid approximately million for addison 
also during  we completed several property acquisitions totaling million before contractual adjustments of which million was in the united states and million was in canada 
these acquisitions were funded primarily from borrowings under our credit agreements 
our development and exploitation capital expenditures during totaled million  of which million was in the united states and million was in canada 
these expenditures were internally funded by approximately million of net cash provided by operating activities and approximately million from disposition of assets 
our and capital expenditures were internally funded by net cash provided by operating activities 
we have planned development and exploitation activities for our major operating areas 
we have budgeted up to million for our development and exploitation activities in  of which million is for the united states and million is for canada 
in addition  we are continuing to evaluate oil and natural gas properties for future acquisitions 
the amount that will be ultimately spent during on acquisitions  development and exploitation activities will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing  the level of cash flow from operations and the availability of additional debt and or equity capital 
if oil and natural gas prices drop significantly for an extended period of time we may reduce our anticipated capital expenditure budget for we strive to maintain our indebtedness at moderate levels in order to provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities 
we expect to continue to utilize cash from operations as well as our available funds under our credit agreements to fund our capital expenditures and working capital during we believe that our capital resources from existing cash balances  cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements are adequate to meet the cash requirements of our business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including production volumes and oil and natural gas prices 
if cash flows decline we would be required to reduce our capital expenditure budget which in turn may effect our production in future periods 
we cannot assure you that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain or initiate planned levels of capital expenditures 
on february   addison  our canadian subsidiary entered into an agreement to purchase oil and natural gas assets totaling approximately million cdn million 
the transaction  which is expected to close on april   will be funded with borrowings under our us credit agreement 
credit agreements on december   we entered into restated us and canadian credit agreements as part of the financing for the acquisition of the primewest properties 
us credit agreement 
our restated us credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to million under a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of million 
our borrowing base is determined based on a number of factors including commodity prices  however  we use hedges to lessen the impact of volatility in commodity prices 
the borrowing base is to be redetermined as of may   and each november and may thereafter 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  letter of credit commitments of  and approximately million available for borrowing under our us credit agreement 
at march   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  letter of credit commitments of  and approximately million available for borrowing 
the us credit agreement contains financial covenants and other restrictions that require us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth as well as financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the us credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a first lien mortgage providing a security interest in of our us oil and natural gas properties 
at our election  interest on borrowings may be i the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus an applicable margin or ii libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin 
at december   the six month libor rate was  which would result in an interest rate of approximately on any new indebtedness we may incur under the us credit agreement

at march   we had approximately us million of outstanding indebtedness and approximately us million available for borrowing 
the canadian credit agreement contains financial covenants and other restrictions that require us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth as well as financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the canadian credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a first lien mortgage providing a security interest in of our canadian oil and natural gas properties 
at our election  interest on borrowings may be i the canadian prime rate plus an applicable margin or ii the banker s acceptance rate plus an applicable margin 
at december   the six month banker s acceptance rate was  which would result in an interest rate of approximately on any new indebtedness we incur under the canadian credit agreement 
at march   our weighted average cost of outstanding canadian indebtedness was 
dividend restrictions 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock  and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our credit agreements currently prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock 
if there is a default under our credit agreements  we will not be able to pay dividends on the shares of our convertible preferred stock 
even if our credit agreements permitted us to pay cash dividends  we can make those payments only from our surplus the excess of the fair value of our total assets over the sum of our liabilities plus our total paid in share capital 
in addition  we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due 
we cannot assure you that we will have any surplus 
financial covenants and ratios 
the us and the canadian credit agreements contain financial covenants and other restrictions which require that we maintain a ratio of our consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of at least to at the end of any fiscal quarter  maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of not less than million adjusted upward by of quarterly net income and of the net proceeds from the issuance of any equity securities after april   not permit the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capital to be greater than at the end of each fiscal quarter  and not permit the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest expense  state and federal taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense to be more than to at the end of each fiscal quarter 
our current assets to current liabilities ratio as defined under our credit agreements was to at december  our consolidated tangible net worth at december  as defined under our credit agreements was approximately million  as compared to approximately million required under our credit agreements 
at december  our consolidated debt to consolidated total capital was and our ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest expense  state and federal taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was to contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at december   with set and determinable payments payments due by period contractual obligations year or less years years after years total in thousands long term debt   operating leases  drilling work commitments   preferred stock dividends    total contractual cash obligations   we also have  in letters of credit that have been issued to various state regulatory agencies and all of which expire in see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  for a discussion of our derivative positions 
effects of the convertible preferred stock offering on june   we sold  shares of convertible preferred stock 
we raised approximately million in gross proceeds approximately million in net proceeds after fees and commissions 
we applied approximately million of the offering proceeds to pay off our bank loans  which were incurred for the acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties and for the acquisition of addison  and have used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes 
dividends on our preferred stock  which are payable quarterly beginning september   are payable only in cash 
currently  the requirement for such dividend payments is approximately million per quarter 
the board has declared and we have paid million in preferred stock dividends during each share of our convertible preferred stock is convertible into one share of our common stock on or before june  each share of convertible preferred stock that has not been converted into our common stock by june   will be automatically converted into one share of our common stock on that date 
common stock as part of the consideration paid in for the acquisition of the central resources properties  we issued a warrant to central resources  inc to purchase  shares of our common stock 
this warrant was assigned and then exercised by a new registered holder on may   for the full  shares at which time we received million cash 
in conjunction with our purchase of addison  the addison managers agreed to purchase shares of our common stock with a portion of the proceeds they received from the sale of their common shares of addison to us 
they purchased in the open market  shares worth  in addition  as part of the addison purchase  we issued  shares  worth  to the addison managers 
the resale of these shares is subject to restriction 
during  employees exercised stock options on a total of  shares of our common stock resulting in proceeds to us of approximately  of these proceeds  was paid in cash and  was being borrowed from us 
during we engaged in a stock buyback program in which we purchased  shares of our common stock for a total of  we have not paid any dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
hedging transactions our production is generally sold at prevailing market prices 
however  we periodically enter into hedging transactions for a portion of our production when market conditions are deemed favorable and oil and natural gas prices exceed our minimum internal price targets 
under the terms of our us credit agreement we are required to hedge at least of our expected oil and natural gas production from our us proved developed producing reserves 
see the discussions in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
our objective in entering into hedging transactions is to manage price fluctuations and achieve a more predictable cash flow associated with our acquisition activities and borrowings under our credit agreements 
these transactions limit exposure to declines in prices  but also limit the benefits we would realize if prices increase 
as of december   we had entered into the following contracts to hedge our natural gas and oil production under the following terms mmbtus per month from january  through december   and mbbls per month from january  through december   and on march   we entered into two additional contracts to sell our natural gas under the following terms mmbtus per month from may  through december   and mmbtus per month from january  through december  we may use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity prices  foreign currency and interest rate risks 
our objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
we occasionally enter into fixed price physical delivery contracts as discussed above as well as commodity price swap derivatives to manage price risk with regard to a portion of our oil and natural gas production 
commodity price swap derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the statement of income when the associated production occurs and the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operations 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as earnings 
to qualify as a cash flow hedge  these swap contracts must be designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value must correlate with changes in the price of anticipated future production such that our exposure to the effects of commodity price changes is reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  and interest rates charged on borrowings and earned on cash equivalent investments 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for hedging purposes  not for trading purposes 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices for natural gas 
pricing for oil and natural gas production is volatile 
in connection with the incurrence of debt related to our acquisition activities and to protect against commodity price fluctuations to achieve a more predictable cash flow  management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and natural gas prices through the use of commodity futures  options and swap agreements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  which established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results from the hedged item on the income statement 
companies must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
to date  we have only used cash flow hedges related to our anticipated production 
for derivatives classified as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of any change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge is immediately recognized as earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured quarterly based on the relative fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
at adoption  we recognized a net derivative liability and a reduction in other comprehensive income of approximately million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change for all cash flow hedges 
oil and natural gas revenues include net gains from the settlement of cash flow hedges of million for the year ended december   and net losses of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized million in other income for hedging ineffectiveness 
the following table sets forth our oil and natural gas hedging activities as of march  our contracts are swap agreements for the sale of oil or natural gas based on nymex pricing

the enron hedges 
on december   enron corp 
and other enron related entities  including enron north america  filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states code in the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york 
we terminated all of our hedging contracts with enron north america  effective as of december   as a result of the failure of the enron affiliate to make payments totaling approximately million due us on december   on hedged natural gas volumes and on december   on hedged oil volumes 
based upon oil and natural gas futures prices on december   we believe that we are owned approximately million  including settlements already due  but the exact amount will be determined pursuant to the terms of the isda master agreement 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we had recognized  as of november   a million derivative asset on our balance sheet 
this amount represented the estimated fair value of the future cash flows to us based upon the market price of oil and natural gas at that date 
due to the complex nature of the enron bankruptcy proceedings and the extensive litigation involving enron  we do not expect that we will receive any settlement as a result of the bankruptcies for an extended period of time  therefore  at december   we have classified the enron derivative asset as an other long term asset and reduced the asset balance to approximately million  which represents our estimate of the fair market value of our bankruptcy claim against enron north america 
our estimate of the value of our bankruptcy claim is based upon informal offers that we have received from third parties attempting to purchase such claims as well as management s best estimate of the financial condition of enron s bankruptcy estate as determined from published reports and court filings related to the bankruptcy 
as a result  we have charged million to expense during as stated above  we terminated the enron hedges effective as of december  under the requirements of sfas no 
 we are required to reclassify amounts related to the enron hedges that remain in other comprehensive income as of the date of the termination into revenue as the oil and natural gas volumes that were hedged are produced 
during the fourth quarter of  we reclassified million related to the enron hedges from other comprehensive income to other income 
at december   approximately million remained in other comprehensive income related to the enron hedges will be reclassified into revenue as other income as shown in the following table amount in thousands during quarter ending march   quarter ending june   quarter ending september   quarter ending december   total amount in  during quarter ending march  quarter ending june  quarter ending september  total amount in  in december  we entered into hedge transactions with a new counterparty  bnp paribas  a financial lending institution the bnp hedges  to replace the enron hedges 
the following table sets forth the bnp hedges for our oil and natural gas volumes as of december  our contracts are swap arrangements for the sale of oil and natural gas based upon nymex pricing

a summary of the changes in the fair value of our hedging transactions during follows in thousands fair value of contracts outstanding as of december   contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year  fair value of terminated enron hedges  change in fair values of outstanding hedge positions  fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  at december   there was approximately  in other comprehensive income related to the bnp paribas hedge 
based upon contractual volumes  we expect to reclassify the entire amount to oil and natural gas revenues during oil and natural gas revenues for the years ended december   and  include a net loss of  a net loss of million and a net gain of million  respectively  from the settlement of cash flow hedges 
realized gains or losses from the settlement of the swaps are recorded in our financial statements as increases or decreases in oil and natural gas revenues 
for example  using the oil swaps in place as of december   if the settlement price exceeded the actual weighted average strike price of  then a reduction in oil revenues would have been recorded for the difference between the settlement price and multiplied by the actual notional volume 
conversely  if the settlement price was less than  then an increase in oil revenues would have been recorded for the difference between the settlement price and multiplied by the notional volume 
for example  for a notional volume of  bbls  if the settlement price was  then oil revenues would have decreased by  conversely  if the settlement price was  oil revenues would have increased by  we report average oil  natural gas and ngls prices including the effects of quality  gathering and transportation costs as well as the net effect of monthly oil and natural gas hedge settlements 
the following table sets forth our oil  natural gas and ngl prices  both realized before monthly hedge settlements and realized including monthly hedge settlements  the net effects of the monthly settlements of our oil and natural gas price hedges on revenue  and effects of the amortization of gains attributable to gains recognized in prior periods from derivative ineffectiveness year ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts average price per bbl of oil realized before monthly hedge settlements average price per bbl of oil realized including monthly hedge settlements average price per bbl of ngls realized before monthly hedge settlements n a average price per bbl of ngls realized including monthly hedge settlements n a average price per mcf of natural gas realized before monthly hedge settlements average price per mcf of natural gas realized including monthly hedge settlements increase reduction in revenue of monthly hedge settlements effects of the amortization of gains losses from derivative ineffectiveness total increase reduction in revenue of hedging results  interest rate risk at december   our exposure to interest rates related primarily to borrowings under our credit agreements and interest earned on short term investments 
as of december   we were not using any derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
interest is payable on borrowings under the credit agreements based on a floating rate as more fully described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if short term interest rates would have averaged higher during the year ended december   our interest expense would have increased by approximately  this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change of to our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements during the year ended december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we account for a significant portion of our business in canadian dollars 
we are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows of our canadian operations that are not denominated in canadian dollars 
presently  a significant portion of the sales of our canadian oil and natural gas is denominated in us dollars 
foreign currency exchange gains and or losses related to these transactions have not been significant 
the borrowings under our canadian credit agreement are denominated in canadian dollars 
the asset and liability balances of our canadian business are translated monthly using current exchange rates  with any resulting unrealized translation gains or losses included in other comprehensive income 
other market risk we discontinued hedge accounting for our enron derivatives effective november  and recognized a charge of million for the impairment of our derivative asset from enron 
at december  we have valued our derivative asset from enron at million  or approximately of the value on the day we terminated our positions 
this valuation is based on informal offers we have received for our position with enron 
we will continue to monitor activities related to enron and may adjust the value of our derivative asset in the future based on new developments and market information
