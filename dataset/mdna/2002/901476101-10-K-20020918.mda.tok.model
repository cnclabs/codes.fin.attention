item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note on forward looking statements statements in this report including but not limited to certain statements in items  and and in other company communications that are not historical facts are forward looking statements  which are based on management s current expectations 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what appears here 
forward looking statements include the company s description of plans and objectives for future operations and assumptions behind those plans 
the words anticipates  believes  intends  estimates  and expects  or similar anticipatory expressions  usually identify forward looking statements 
in addition  goals established by twin disc  incorporated should not be viewed as guarantees or promises of future performance 
there can be no assurance the company will be successful in achieving its goals 
in addition to the assumptions and information referred to specifically in the forward looking statements  other factors could cause actual results to be materially different from what is presented here 
results of operations net sales  new orders and backlog net sales for the last three fiscal years have been very stable 
sales of million in fiscal were percent ahead of the previous fiscal year and then declined by a lesser amount to million in fiscal however  the drop in fiscal would have been about percent were it not for the addition of first year revenues from nico transmission company ntc  a japanese marketing and engineering joint venture established at the end of fiscal  that offsets declines in our continuing core business 
order rates for most of our products were down throughout much of the past two fiscal years  contributing  along with improved deliveries  to a steady decline in backlog 
the backlog of orders scheduled for shipment during the next six months six month backlog dropped percent to million between june and june and another percent  to million at end of fiscal demand continued at a steady pace for the first part of fiscal  but eased somewhat by mid year 
shipments followed the same pattern with favorable year to year comparisons during the first half in all forward market product lines as well as aftermarket service parts 
as fiscal progressed  we experienced softening demand for power shift transmissions and torque converters and for power take offs used in irrigation and waste recycling applications 
these declines were partially offset by the increased volume of shipments for military applications  surface drive marine propulsion units  and the continuing steady demand for marine transmissions produced overseas 
indicative of a modest recovery in certain of the company s markets  fourth quarter shipments of power take offs were approximately equal to year earlier levels 
the contraction in global economic activity continued into fiscal and was most significantly reflected in the declining shipments of pleasure craft marine transmissions 
marine market softness persisted throughout the year and was the largest single factor in the lower core business sales 
while there were minor upturns in demand for most products  there also were unanticipated declines that resulted in overall relatively soft demand and reduced shipments across the board 
the exception to that was a modest increase in propulsion product sales 
shipments from our wholly owned distribution companies  primarily those offshore  continued to register sales gains in fiscal as recovering economies  particularly in the pacific rim  were a positive influence 
in fiscal  shipments declined as a result of weak market conditions and stronger foreign competition caused by the continuing strength of the us dollar 
the us dollar strengthened against most currencies in fiscal years and and maintained that edge until the final months of fiscal as a result  through most of the past three fiscal years there has been increased pricing pressure from non dollar based competition  and sales from our offshore subsidiaries have been reported at lower levels when translated into us dollars 
until the fiscal drop in shipments from our belgian subsidiary  there was an offsetting favorable impact caused by higher margins realized on dollar denominated sales 
price increases  implemented selectively in each year  generated revenues about equal to the rate of inflation 
at the end of fiscal  the six month backlog was million  a substantial reduction from the prior year end 
the decline was due primarily to reduced orders for marine and industrial products 
as fiscal opened  order rates generally remained weak but longer term military orders rolling into the six month window and irregular order peaks helped to stabilize the six month backlog through most of the year 
during the fourth quarter  those contracts were completed and weaker seasonal order patterns were seen 
in addition  customers continued to adjust to the shorter lead times achieved over the past two years 
as a result  the six month backlog at the end of fiscal had declined to million  percent below the prior year end 
margins  costs and expenses a strong focus on continuous improvement in manufacturing methods and processes enabled us to improve domestic manufacturing margins throughout the past three fiscal years 
with the exception of our belgian operation  which was hampered by reduced volume during the past year  similar efforts in europe have led to better margins in that area as well 
we also have maintained pressure on fixed costs to help sustain our profitability during cyclical downturns 
in fiscal  incremental improvements in all aspects of our manufacturing operations from on time delivery to inventory reduction and cellular layout led the way to higher gross margins 
during the fourth quarter  we provided for approximately million of inventory obsolescence and  for a marine transmission warranty program 
although the fourth quarter margin was down somewhat from the comparable period a year earlier  it was consistent with previous fiscal quarters 
despite declining production volume in fiscal  domestic manufacturing margins improved due to a more favorable product mix and the increased efficiencies mentioned previously 
however  we were unable to overcome the volume induced margin declines at our principal plant in europe and the lower margins on ntc sales into its home market 
as a result  the consolidated gross margin declined by almost two percentage points in the most recently completed fiscal year 
marketing  engineering  and administrative me a expense declined four percent in fiscal as a result of previous year staff reductions  continued attention to cost  and closure of our south african distribution operation 
in fiscal  me a was virtually unchanged from the previous year 
approximately one half of the million increase in fiscal spending was due to the first year expenses of ntc  and the balance consisted of added marketing and engineering expenses related to the development and introduction of new marine and electronic controls products 
early in fiscal  we closed our wholly owned distribution company in spain and engaged an independent company to represent twin disc in that market 
the impact on revenues and profitability was not significant 
during the third fiscal quarter  we sold our minority interest in niigata converter company to our joint venture partner and recorded a gain of million in other income 
most of the proceeds were applied to the outstanding debt  but a portion was used to capitalize a new marketing and engineering joint venture that will support our global marine product line 
recognizing the reduced order activity in the latter half of fiscal  severance and voluntary separation programs to reduce the domestic manufacturing workforce were implemented in the fourth quarter 
in addition  representing about one third of the million fourth quarter restructuring charge see footnote q to the consolidated financial statements  reserves were taken for the closure of two sales offices and one assembly facility whose activities will continue to be handled from other locations 
the facilities were closed in fiscal and early fiscal in addition  there were manpower adjustments at several other facilities 
it is anticipated that the restructuring will result in annual pretax savings of approximately  when fully effective in fiscal the savings are generated primarily by the reduction in manpower 
the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal on review  it was determined that there is no impairment in these assets and thus no losses were recorded for the fiscal year 
the favorable after tax impact on earnings due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was  or 
per share for the fiscal year 
interest  taxes and net earnings interest expense declined in fiscal as debt was reduced by million and  although a large portion of our debt is in fixed rate notes  we benefited from the drop in us interest rates 
additionally  settlement of a federal tax issue in the fiscal fourth quarter allowed the reversal of previously accrued interest expense 
in fiscal  rates remained low and debt was reduced a further million  resulting in another large drop in interest expense 
in each of the past three fiscal years  limitations on foreign tax credit utilization  the relatively high proportion of foreign earnings  and settlement of some state tax issues resulted in an unusually high effective tax rate 
the effective rate in fiscal was increased further by two third quarter adjustments totaling about  a tax incentive provided by the belgian government several years ago was disallowed by the european commission and was repaid  and the united states tax provision was adjusted upward for the taxes due on an asset sale gain recorded in last year s third quarter 
statutory rates generally have not changed 
liquidity and capital resources the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal remained at about the same million level as the previous year 
in both years  positive cash flows from earnings  depreciation  and working capital reductions were partially offset by taxes and by increased contributions to the company pension fund 
in fiscal  operating cash flows increased to million with the favorable impact of inventory reductions and reduced pension contributions 
expenditures for capital equipment for the past three fiscal years have been held to a level of about one half depreciation 
while the desire to conserve cash has been one consideration  we also have been more selective in adding major machine tools and have focused on our core competency manufacturing cells 
plans are for increased spending in the coming year to provide for further development of key cells 
liquidity has improved in each of the last two years 
cash balances have risen  debt has been reduced  working capital has remained at about million  and the current ratio has been unchanged at the company s balance sheet is strong  there are no off balance sheet arrangements  and we continue to have sufficient liquidity for near term needs 
the company has obligations under non cancelable operating lease contracts and loan and senior note agreements for certain future payments 
a summary of those commitments follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years short term debt   revolving loan borrowing   long term debt     operating leases      the company believes the capital resources available in the form of existing cash  lines of credit see footnote h to the consolidated financial statements  and funds provided by operations will be adequate to meet anticipated capital expenditures and other foreseeable future business requirements 
other matters environmental matters the company is involved in various stages of investigation relative to hazardous waste sites on the united states epa national priorities list 
it is not possible at this time to determine the ultimate outcome of those matters  but  as discussed further in footnote p to the consolidated financial statements  they are not expected to affect materially the company s operations  financial position  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the preparation of this annual report requires management s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
twin disc s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements on pages and of this form 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition twin disc recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
while we respect the customer s right to return products that were shipped in error or do not function properly  historical experience shows those types of adjustments have been immaterial and thus no provision is made 
with respect to other revenue recognition issues  management has concluded that its policies are appropriate and in accordance with the guidance provided by securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the parent company  and by the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate must be estimated 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure and assessing the realizability of temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is deemed more likely than not that a temporary difference will be realized 
recently issued accounting standards during fiscal  the financial accounting standards board issued several statements of accounting standards that are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements on pages and of this form 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities and foreign exchange 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments and other pro active management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
discussions of the company s accounting policies and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements on pages and of this form 
interest rate risk the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to the prime and libor interest rates 
those debt facilities bear interest predominantly at the prime interest rate minus 
or libor plus 
due to the relative stability of interest rates  the company did not utilize any financial instruments at june  to manage interest rate risk exposure 
a percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately  commodity price risk the company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for such commodities as steel and aluminum 
due to the relative stability of these commodities  the company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure 
currency risk the company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
approximately one third of the company s revenues in the years ended june  and were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
of that total  approximately two thirds was denominated in euros with the balance composed of japanese yen and the australian and singapore dollars 
the company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the currency fluctuations on significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative financial instruments the company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the company corporate treasury and restrict derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited 
the company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and no 
the statement requires all derivative instruments to be recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the change in the fair value of a derivative is required to be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
initial adoption and subsequent application of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s statement of financial position or results of operations 
the company primarily enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
these contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions 
gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period 
the primary currency to which the company was exposed in was the euro 
at june  the company had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase euros in the value of  with a weighted average maturity of days 
the fair value of the company s contracts was approximately million at june  the primary currencies to which the company was exposed in were the belgian franc and the italian lira 
the fair value of the company s contracts to purchase belgian francs and sell italian lira was approximately million and million  respectively at june
