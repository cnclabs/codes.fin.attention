item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document 
overview decode was incorporated in august we are a genomics and health informatics company that provides products and services for the healthcare industry 
our approach to the discovery of healthcare knowledge brings together three key types of non personally identifiable population data derived from the icelandic nation information from the healthcare system  information about genealogical relationships among individuals covered by this system and associated molecular genetics data 
we are developing three avenues of commercialization discovery services  database services and informatics related to analysis of human genome data and healthcare 
the discovery services focus on gene and drug target discovery  the development and marketing of dna based diagnostics for major diseases and pharmacogenomics  or the discovery of genes related to drug response 
database services include the clinical genome miner  containing tools to discover or validate disease linked genes based on non personally identifiable genotypic  genealogical and phenotypic data 
in addition  decode intends to construct and commercialize the icelandic health sector database and the decode combined data processing system 
the icelandic health sector database contains non personally identifiable data from icelandic healthcare records  and the decode combined data processing system allows cross referencing of data from the icelandic health sector database with genealogical and genotypic data 
informatics will encompass the building of tools for computerized analysis of healthcare data and of genetic and disease related data  as well as software relating to computer security  privacy protection and encryption 
we have incurred losses since our inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of  we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next several years as we expand our internal and collaborative gene discovery efforts  continue our commercialization of discovery efforts  technology development and construction of database services and informatics 
we expect that our losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial especially because progress in our scientific work and milestone payments that are related to progress can fluctuate between quarters 
collaborations and alliances in february  we entered into a research collaboration and cross license agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche  or roche  regarding research into the genetic causes of twelve diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  roche has made equity investments and funded gene discovery programs in the twelve diseases through january when the term of the agreement expired 
in june  we entered into a collaboration and cross license agreement with roche regarding diagnostics 
under the terms of this new agreement  we are collaborating on the development and marketing of dna based diagnostics for major diseases 
we are working with roche to identify and validate molecular targets which are useful for developing products and services that accurately establish a patient s current diagnosis  predict future risk of disease  predict drug response and determine responses to treatment or the health status of individuals and enable early prevention or treatment of disease 
we will also be focusing on developing informatics products and services  which will include software tools and databases 
under the agreement we will receive payments including research funding  research milestones and royalties on any products that are commercialized 
the research term under the agreement is five years 
in june  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genmab a s and medarex  inc pursuant to which we are collaborating on the research  development  and commercialization of new antibody therapeutic products 
under this five year collaboration  we are utilizing novel targets discovered in our research on the genetics of common diseases along with genmab s human antibody technology 
the collaboration covers a broad range of disease areas including cardiovascular disease  inflammatory disease and cancer 
together with genmab and medarex  we will share equally in the development costs and revenues generated from the outlicensing or sales of products developed under the agreement 
under the terms of this collaboration  medarex will also contribute resources and will share certain costs and commercial rights 
in june  we entered into an agreement to provide genmab a s with research and development services to develop dna based tests to predict individual clinical response to genmab s antibody treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and possible related novel therapeutics 
we will be paid as stages of the research program are completed 
in july  we entered into a pharmacogenomics collaboration and license agreement with affymetrix  inc under the terms of the agreement the parties are collaborating in the research and development of gene expression tests and nucleic acid based tests to predict the response of individual patients to various drugs 
we are undertaking the initial research activities to be performed with respect to the initial ten drugs to be studied under the collaboration 
affymetrix will supply various chips in connection with the research 
we will share revenues resulting from the collaboration  including those from licensing and product commercialization  with affymetrix 
in july  we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement with applied biosystems group  or abg 
under the terms of the agreement  we are working with abg to jointly develop and commercialize software products for the collection  organization and analysis of genotyping information 
the agreement provides for the development to be overseen by a joint steering committee that has specific responsibilities for the implementation and management of the joint development and joint commercialization programs 
under this agreement  abg and we have granted to each other licenses to products developed under the joint development program 
in december  we formed a pharmacogenomics alliance with pharmacia corporation to identify the role of genetics in the development of advanced forms of heart disease 
under the agreement  we will employ our population resources and clinical genome miner discovery system to find genetic markers that can be used to identify patients who are highly predisposed to progressing from an early to an advanced form of heart disease 
if the results of the first phase are encouraging  pharmacia has the option to use the genetic markers as the basis for clinical trials of cardiovascular drugs under development at pharmacia 
we will receive contract fees as part of the first phase of this agreement and  in addition  royalties on sales of diagnostic tests as well as royalties on potential sales of cardiovascular drugs should pharmacia exercise its licensing options in the alliance 
in january  we entered into a new collaboration and cross license agreement with roche 
this new  three year alliance leverages our expanding capabilities in drug discovery into developing novel treatments for common diseases 
under this new alliance  roche will provide research funding for a minimum of the next two years for us to conduct downstream research in a selection of four diseases  with the goal of using the targets identified to discover and develop new therapeutic compounds and to take these compounds into clinical trials 
also  we will receive development and regulatory approval milestone payments for therapeutic drug compounds developed pursuant to the agreement as well as royalties on roche s sales of drugs developed under the agreement 
additionally  we will pay roche royalties should we develop and market drugs for certain common diseases 
we have a number of collaborative agreements with local medical institutions and doctors regarding particular disease research 
these agreements generally extend for a period of five years 
under the agreements  these institutions and or physicians contribute data or other clinical information and we contribute equipment  research supplies and our molecular genetics and experimental design expertise 
the agreements also require us to reimburse all project related expenses 
if we sell project results  the agreements require us to make specified payments and pay a portion of performance based milestone payments that we receive 
we have a settlement agreement with a us medical institution whereby we are committed to pay royalties and milestone payments if we are successful in developing and commercializing products that result from a particular technology jointly owned by the medical institution and us 
acquisition of medichem in march  we acquired medichem life sciences  inc in a stock for stock exchange to be accounted for as a purchase transaction 
the acquisition gives us capabilities in chemistry and structural proteomics that will be used in the implementation of its strategy of turning its targets identified by applying population genomics to common diseases into novel drugs for the market 
building upon the acquisition of medichem  we will be creating an integrated biopharmaceutical company capable of bringing our own targets into proprietary drug discovery 
through the acquisition we added approximately new employees and facilities in illinois and washington 
in the first quarter of  we will record the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and allocate the purchase price approximately million  based upon independent valuations  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we will allocate the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets acquired to identified intangibles  including developed technology  patents  customer and other contracts and agreements that have estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
based upon a preliminary review  we estimate the charge to earnings for acquired in process research and development to be approximately million and the annual amortization charge for other identifiable intangibles to amount to approximately million 
also based on this preliminary review  we estimate resulting goodwill will be approximately million 
the amount allocated to identified intangibles will be determined upon the completion of independent appraisals and  therefore  may differ from our current estimate 
our consolidated financial statements will include the cash flows and results of medichem from march  and the integration of medichem will impact our results of operations and our financial position 
with medichem  our revenues will increase but our operating expenses and likely our net losses will also increase 
in addition  we expect to fund the working capital needs and operating activities of medichem in the near term 
the extent to which medichem will ultimately impact our results of operations and financial condition is largely dependant upon how quickly and in what proportion medichem s capacity is brought to bear on our in house programs and how much of their existing contract services business is maintained and developed 
general we anticipate that collaborations will remain an important element of our business strategy and future revenues 
our ability to generate revenue growth and become profitable is dependent  in part  on our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  and on our ability and our collaborative partners ability to successfully commercialize products incorporating  or based on  our work 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand our existing collaborations  enter into future collaborations to develop applications based on existing or future research agreements or successfully commercialize the decode combined data processing system 
we intend to invest in discovery services  database services and healthcare informatics  and expect to report net losses for the next several years 
if the costs of these investments are greater than anticipated  or if they take longer to complete  or if losses are incurred from strategic investments  we may incur losses for a longer period of time 
our failure to successfully develop and market products over the next several years  or to realize product revenues  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect to receive royalties or other revenues from commercial sales of products developed using our technologies for at least several years  if at all 
we have made and intend to continue to make strategic equity investments in  and acquisitions of  technologies and businesses that are complementary to our business 
as a result  we may record losses or expenses related to our proportionate ownership interest in such long term equity investments  record charges for the acquisition of in process technologies  or record charges for the recognition of the impairment in the value of the securities underlying such investments 
our operating results through december  reflect the expenses incurred in our gene discovery activities  partly offset by the revenues received pursuant to our research and development collaborations with roche and other recent collaborations in connection with these activities 
we will continue these activities  but our operating results will also reflect the substantial costs we expect to incur in building technology and services for the clinical genome miner and commencing the development of the icelandic health sector database and the decode combined data processing system 
while we intend to enter into collaborations to help fund and develop the these database services  until we do so there will be no revenue from our database service activities to offset against these costs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to collaborative arrangements  property and equipment  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies  materials and supplies  derivatives  intangible assets  and bad debts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results may not differ from the estimates referred to above 
collaborations and revenue 
our collaborative arrangements and the recognition of revenue in such arrangements is the accounting policy most critical to us 
we have formed and will continue to form strategic alliances with collaborative partners 
these agreements will consist of a variety of disease focused programs under which we have or will conduct research funded by our partners  form alliances that combine the transfer of intellectual property with collaborative research and or development in respect of a specific disease  therapeutic or diagnostic approach  and license intellectual property developed as a result of our proprietary research and development 
currently a substantial portion of our revenues relate to funded research collaborations 
under these arrangements  we perform research in a specific disease area or disease areas aimed at discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products 
these arrangements generally have fixed terms and renewal periods specific to each agreement 
under these agreements we are entitled to receive committed payments for which we recognize revenue over the term of the associated contract  inclusive of renewal periods to which the company is contractually bound 
in addition  we generally receive contractually agreed milestone payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development milestones 
we recognize milestones when acknowledgement of having achieved applicable performance requirements is received 
upon notification of the achievement of the milestone a portion of the milestone payment equal to the percentage of the collaboration completed through that date is recognized  with the remainder recognized as services are performed generally straight line over the remaining estimated term of the collaboration 
we record revenue earned from our research contracts in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of our various contracts  that is  when payment becomes contractually due 
revenue is generally recorded as contract research costs are incurred  including the percentage of completion basis  for non refundable up front fees or upon the achievement of milestones 
revenue recorded is a focal metric for us as it is  we believe  an important measure of value we create in a given reporting period 
as such  we discuss both revenue recognized under gaap in our income statement and revenue recorded to our balance sheet in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report 
given the nature of some of our contractual obligations  we may invoice in advance of the work being completed or we may be required to recognize revenue under gaap in advance of being contractually permitted to invoice for our services 
revenue invoiced in advance of satisfying the applicable criteria for revenue recognition remains as deferred revenue in our balance sheet at any reporting date and then is recognized a revenue as we provide the related services 
revenue recognized prior to the time we are contractually entitled to invoice is reported as unbilled costs and fees 
in considering whether to recognize unbilled revenues we assess the likelihood of successfully fulfilling our obligations under the arrangement as well as the risk of collection 
however  to date there have been no losses recorded with respect to such contracts 
we are also entitled to royalties or profit sharing under the terms of our agreements 
due to the extended time period for the development and commercialisation of a saleable product or therapy  we have not yet received royalties or profit sharing under any of our contracts 
although we currently depend upon funded research arrangements for a significant portion of our revenue  we are increasing our investment in proprietary research and we will incur the costs of such research 
in the near term  this will require us to continue to make significant investments to expand our in house capabilities for downstream development which we believe will better position us capture the most value to us in our discoveries 
as we identify promising discoveries for further development  we may choose to continue the development ourselves into and through clinical trials  regulatory clearances and manufacture  distribution and marketing 
in other cases we are or will be working to varying degrees with partners 
this shift from primarily funded research activities to more proprietary research activities will  we believe  increase the potential reward to us from our research 
in doing so  we may trade off and amount of revenue guaranteed for the short term ie  research funding that would go to support these activities 
we have undertaken this shift with the view of increasing our stake in the long term value of our discoveries 
other 
we consider certain other accounting matters related to property and equipment  foreign exchange transactions  income taxes and litigation and other contingencies to also be important policies for us 
property and equipment 
our property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
we periodically review property and equipment for potential impairments and to assess whether their service lives have been affected by continued technological change and development 
for example  in we reduced the service lives of our gene sequencing machines from five years to four years to better reflect our estimate of the service lives of these machines 
the change resulted in an increase to depreciation expense of million in should we determine that the pace of technological change or other matters dictate that we change the estimated service lives of other of our assets  there will be an impact on depreciation expense from the date of the change 
should we determine that there has been an impairment of our fixed assets  goodwill or other intangible assets we would suffer an increase to our net loss or a reduction of our net income in the period such a determination is made 
foreign exchange transactions 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
however  in light of the significance of our operations outside the united states  an important element of our cost base is or will be denominated in icelandic krona  including much of our payroll and other operating expenses and some of our recent long term borrowings 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  we have entered into and will likely continue to enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to such fluctuations 
income taxes 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets resulting from deductible operating losses and other items 
due to primarily to our history of operating losses and the expectation that such losses will continue into the foreseeable future  we have concluded that currently there is insufficient positive evidence exists to justify the recognition of our net deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
although there can be no assurance that losses generated to date will be used to offset future taxable income  an adjustment to the valuation of our current net deferred tax assets in the future would increase income in the period that we made a determination that such an adjustment was appropriate 
income tax in iceland is payable in icelandic krona 
consequently  the us dollar value of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates 
such fluctuations over time may increase or reduce the reported us dollar balance of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and there would be a corresponding gain or loss reported in our income statement 
litigation and other contingencies 
we consider litigation and other claims and potential claims or contingencies in preparing our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
although we are party to litigation and other actual or potential claims  our legal counsel and we are unable to estimate the probability of an unfavourable outcome or estimate any resulting loss 
consequently  we have not included an accrual for such costs in our financial statements 
changes or developments in the relevant action or our strategy in such proceedings could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
since the recognition of a loss is dependent upon factors not completely in the control of management  timing of a charge  if any  is difficult to predict with certainty 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon  among other things  the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our own research and development efforts and how quickly and in what proportion medichem s capacity is brought to bear on our in house programs 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  development by us or our competitors of new technological innovations  ability to market products or services  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key suppliers  protection of proprietary technology  ability to obtain additional financing  ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements  reliance on the license to create and run the icelandic health sector database  and compliance with governmental and other regulations 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic or diagnostic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues 
the following is a summary of deferred revenue december  revenue recorded during the year ended    revenue recognized during the year ended    deferred revenue at beginning of year    deferred revenue at end of year    our revenues increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues attributable to our research collaboration agreement with roche were  for the year ended december  as compared  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  or increase in total revenues from to principally results from the recognition of revenue from new milestone achievements under our research collaboration with roche but also from the new diagnostics collaboration with roche and the joint development and commercialization with abg 
the  or increase in revenues from to primarily resulted from new milestones having been achieved under the agreement with roche in at december   the total amount of deferred research revenue that will be recognized in future periods aggregated  revenues recorded increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  or increase in recorded revenues from to is principally attributable to our new diagnostics collaboration with roche and other recent collaborations  but also results from greater milestone achievements under our research collaboration with roche 
the  or increase in recorded revenues from to is principally attributable to greater milestone achievements under the research collaboration with roche 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have continued to expand our research and development operations  including hiring of additional research personnel with the resulting salary and benefits costs  an expansion of our laboratory facilities and equipment acquisitions  and the resulting depreciation  purchase and use of consumables  and our increased research efforts 
the  or increase in research and development expenses from to is primarily attributable to depreciation on the expanded asset base and increased purchases of consumables in support of  among other things  our new abi prism dna analyzers  salaries and contractor services  and the disposal of laboratory equipment 
the  or increase in research and development expenses from to resulted from depreciation on the expanded asset base and salaries and contractor services and also from license fee costs payable to the icelandic government  as required by the icelandic health sector database operating license  that were recorded in the year ended december  but no such costs were recorded in the year ended december  because the license had not yet been issued 
we expect to continue to increase research and development spending as we pursue and expand our efforts 
we also expect research and development to increase with the establishment of our new subsidiaries  medichem  encode  and decode cancer as well as a result of our new diagnostics development contract with roche  therapeutics development contract with roche and other recent collaborations 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
without regard to a million of non cash litigation settlement charge in the year ended december   million of stock based contributions in the year ended december   and stock based compensation and remuneration charges during all periods  general and administrative expense increased approximately million or from to and million or from to as a result of added salaries  contractor services and other general and administrative expenses in the continued expansion of our operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to build our operations  notably with the inclusion and integration of medichem into the business 
stock based compensation and remuneration expense 
stock based compensation and remuneration expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
with little compensation being attributed to our more recent stock option grants  stock based compensation and remuneration expense has been decreasing as grants made to employees in earlier years become fully vested 
historical stock based compensation and remuneration is not necessarily representative of the effects on reported income or loss for future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options  the value of stock options that have been granted in recent times and the value of additional options that may be granted in future years 
interest income 
our interest income was  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or from to is attributable to the decline of prevailing interest rates but also from an overall decrease in our cash balance as we continue to use the proceeds of our initial public offering for operations 
the increase of  or from to resulted from overall higher cash reserves as a result of our initial public offering 
other non operating income and expense  net 
our other non operating income and expense  net increased to a net expense of  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net other non operating expense primarily results from foreign exchange losses in the current periods 
income taxes 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  and did not owe any icelandic or us federal income taxes nor did we pay any in the years ended december   or realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
as of december   we had net operating losses able to be carried forward for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income in the united states that expire at various dates through also  as of december  our foreign subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire in varying amounts beginning in net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share 
net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share were  and for the year ended december   respectively  as compared to  and for the year ended december  and  and for the year ended december   respectively 
this is an increase of in net loss and a decrease of in basic and diluted net loss per share from to and an increase of in net loss and a decrease of in basic and diluted net loss per share from to although net loss has increased in the three years ended december   basic and diluted net loss per share has decreased primarily as a result of the greater number of average shares outstanding as a result of our initial public offering in july pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share 
pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share is computed for periods prior to our initial public offering as if the preferred shares had converted into common shares immediately upon their issuance 
accordingly  in the calculation of pro forma net loss per share for such periods  net loss has not been increased for the dividends accumulated or discounts on preferred stock amortized during such periods 
basic and diluted net loss per share increased to for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from collaborative agreements and the issuance of equity securities and debt instruments 
for the previous three years  we have received cash of approximately million from collaborative research agreements  million from the issuance of common stock  million from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants  and million from privately placed bonds  bank loans and equipment financing 
during  and we received total research and development funding of million from roche 
as of december   future funding under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments and royalties that we may earn under such collaborations 
cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  including part of a bridge loan million that is restricted as to its use as of december  available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
our cash is deposited only with financial institutions in iceland  the united kingdom and the united states having a high credit standing 
this cash is largely invested in us dollar denominated money market and checking accounts and also in icelandic krona denominated accounts 
inflation has been significant in iceland during the year ended december  but has not had a material effect on our business 
operating activities 
funds from working capital sources provided  of cash for operating activities for year ended december  as compared to a use of funds of  for the year ended december  and  provided for the year ended december  as a result  although net loss increased  for the year ended december  as compared to december   net cash used in operating activities increased just  to  in the year ended december  as compared to a use of funds of  in the year ended december  investing activities 
our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures and long term strategic equity investments in  and acquisitions of  technologies and businesses that are complementary to our business 
purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  were  as compared to  in the year ended december  and  in the year ended december  primarily due to the expansion of our facilities and operations 
particularly  during the year ended december  we expended million in respect of the new building to house our operations in the university district of reykjavik and we paid for the fifty new abi prism dna analyzers acquired late in million 
net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments 
financing activities 
net cash of  was provided in financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to  provided in the year ended december  and  in the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities in was largely due to approximately million of net proceeds from our july initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities in was principally due to the financing of certain equipment and of our new headquarters facility 
in december  we established a bridge loan with an icelandic financial institution for the purposes of financing the construction of our new headquarters facility 
total borrowing was million and carried an annual interest rate equal to a short term libor rate plus 
portions of the bridge loan expired upon settlement in january and march out of the proceeds of tier a bonds and the tier c bonds tier d bank loan  respectively  as discussed below 
monies received in respect of the tier a bonds million are included in cash and cash equivalents at december  and monies received in respect of the tier c bonds and the tier d bank loan million are included in restricted cash as a result of the contractual terms with the financial institution 
in december  we borrowed million from an icelandic bank for the construction of our new headquarters facility 
the borrowing is collateralized by the property and improvements and consists of privately placed bonds tier a approximately million denominated in icelandic krona and linked to the icelandic consumer price index that is payable annually beginning december and bears annual interest of that is payable annually beginning december  and  a million bank loan tier b denominated in us dollars that is payable quarterly beginning march and bears annual interest of three month libor plus that is payable quarterly beginning march the lender may demand prepayment of the tier b bank loan in certain circumstances 
the tier a bonds and the tier b bank loan were placed in january and december  respectively 
concurrently  we entered into a cross currency swap as an economic hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations that may occur on tier a bonds 
as of december  we had this outstanding contract with a face amount of million bearing annual interest of three month libor plus 
in march  we borrowed a further million from an icelandic bank for the construction of our new headquarters facility 
the borrowing is collateralized by the property and improvements and consists of privately placed bonds tier c approximately million denominated in icelandic krona and linked to the icelandic consumer price index that is payable in march and bears annual interest of that is payable annually beginning march  and  a million bank loan tier d denominated in us dollars that is payable in march and bears annual interest of three month libor plus that is payable quarterly beginning june tier c bonds may be prepaid at each interest payment date and the tier d bank loan may be prepaid on the anniversary date of the loan starting december concurrently  we entered into a cross currency swap as an economic hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations that may occur on the tier c bonds 
this contract with a face amount of million expires in march and bears annual interest of twelve month libor plus 
in connection with the tier c bonds and the tier d bank loan  we issued a warrant giving the holder the right to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at per share  as adjusted 
the warrants expire in march and convert to shares of our common stock automatically in the event the market value of a share of our common stock should exceed for thirty consecutive days of trading 
contractual commitments 
our major outstanding contractual commitments relate to the privately placed bonds and bank loans  equipment lease financings  our license for the icelandic health sector database  a minimum purchase commitment to abg and the remaining construction costs with respect to our new headquarters facility 
our contractual commitments as of december  were as follows payments due by period less than due total year years years thereafter in thousands long term debt      capital lease obligations  including interest    operating leases     icelandic health sector database license     minimum purchase commitment to abg   new building construction   general 
we expect cash requirements to continue to increase significantly as we invest in genotyping  sequencing and bioinformatics capabilities  integrate medichem into our operations  invest in software and hardware to support the continuing development of the database services  continue to seek access to technologies through investments  research and development alliances  license agreements and or acquisitions  and continue to make improvements in existing facilities and invest in new facilities 
based upon our current plans  and taking into consideration the proceeds of the initial public offering and recent debt financings  we believe that our existing resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for several years 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to obtain new research collaboration agreements  to obtain subscription and collaboration agreements for the database services  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  including capital equipment necessary to ensure that our sequencing and genotyping operations remain competitive  and capital expenditures required to expand our facilities 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
we will require significant additional capital in the future  which we may seek to raise through further public or private equity offerings  additional debt financing or added collaborations and licensing arrangements 
no assurance can be given that additional financing or collaborations and licensing arrangements will be available when needed  or that if available  will be obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may have to curtail operations or attempt to raise funds on unattractive terms 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized 
with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we are required to adopt sfas no 
for fiscal year and we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results from operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in our investment portfolio may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market and checking accounts 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and investment prices 
these changes may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we seek to manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we control and manage foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk  and investment price risk by continually monitoring changes in key economic indicators and market information 
as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
we continue to monitor our exposure to currency risk but have not yet purchased instruments to hedge these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we hold various interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to manage the liquidity and cash needs of our day to day operations 
as a result  we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates 
in order to mitigate risks associated with interest rate sensitive liabilities we use interest rate derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  and may in future use other instruments to achieve the desired interest rate maturities and asset liability structures 
we are exposed to credit or repayment risk  as well as market risk from the use of derivative instruments 
if the counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our credit risk will equal the positive market value in a derivative 
consequently  when the fair market value of a derivative contract is positive  this indicates that the counterparty owes us  thus creating a repayment risk for us 
when the fair market value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counterparty and therefore  assume no repayment risk 
in order to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments  we enter into transactions with high quality counterparties such as financial institutions that satisfy our established credit approval criteria 
we review the credit ratings of such counterparties on a regular basis
