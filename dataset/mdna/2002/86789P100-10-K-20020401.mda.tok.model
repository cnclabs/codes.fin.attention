item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we may experience component shortages  which would cause us to delay shipments to customers  resulting in potential declines in net sales and operating results 
we attempt to mitigate the risks of component shortages by working with customers to delay delivery schedules or by working with suppliers to provide the needed components using just in time inventory programs 
competition the electronics manufacturing services industry is extremely competitive and includes hundreds of companies 
the contract manufacturing services we provide are available from many independent sources 
many of our competitors are more established in the industry and have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  or marketing resources than we do 
certain of our competitors have broader geographic presence than we do  including manufacturing facilities in foreign countries 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our targeted market are quality  reliability  ability to meet delivery schedules  technological sophistication  geographic location  and price 
we also face competition from current and potential customers  which are continually evaluating the relative merits of internal manufacturing versus contract manufacturing for various products 
intellectual property we seek to protect our proprietary technology and other intangible assets primarily through trade secret protection 
in addition  we depend heavily on training  recruiting  and retaining our employees  who are required to have sufficient know how to operate advanced equipment and to conduct sensitive and complicated manufacturing processes 
governmental regulation our operations are subject to certain federal  state  and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental  waste management  and health and safety matters  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in complying with those regulations or that past or future operations will not result in exposure to injury or claims of injury by employees or the public 
to meet various legal requirements  we have modified our circuit board cleaning processes to utilize only aqueous water based methods 
some risk of liabilities related to these matters is inherent in our business  as with many similar businesses 
our management team believes that our business is operated in substantial compliance with applicable environmental  waste management  and health and safety regulations  the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in the event of violation  these regulations provide for civil and criminal fines  injunctions  and other sanctions and  in certain instances  allow third parties to sue to enforce compliance 
in addition  new  modified  or more stringent requirements or enforcement policies could be adopted that may adversely affect our business 
we periodically generate and temporarily handle limited amounts of materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law 
we engage independent contractors for the off site disposal of these materials 
for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results our failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in fines and revocation of permits necessary to our manufacturing processes 
employees as of march   we had  full time equivalent employees 
as of the same date  we also engaged the full time services of temporary laborers through employment agencies in manufacturing operations 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
our management team believes that our relationship with our employees is good

organization and basis of financial presentation suntron corporation is a provider of vertically integrated electronics manufacturing solutions supplying high mix services for aerospace and defense  semiconductor  industrial controls  instrumentation  medical  networking  and telecommunications industries 
our manufacturing services include printed circuit card assembly  cable and harness production  plastic injection molding  sheet metal  engineering services  and full systems integration  testing  and after market repair and warranty services 
high mix manufacturing involves processing printed circuit board assemblies in small lots generally less than assemblies per production run in a flexible manufacturing environment 
our success in the marketplace is a direct result of our ability to provide intelligent solutions tailored to match customer requirements  while meeting the highest quality standards in the industry 
suntron was formed as a holding company for the purpose of effecting the business combination of eftc corporation and k tec operating company  llc formerly known as thayer blum funding ii  llc and its wholly owned subsidiary  k tec electronics holding corporation 
the combination of eftc and k tec was completed on february  and  in connection with the combination  eftc and k tec each became a wholly owned subsidiary of suntron 
as a result of the combination  the former holder of membership interests in k tec operating company  llc received  shares of suntron common stock  and the former shareholders of eftc received 
shares of suntron common stock for each share of eftc common stock  resulting in the issuance of an additional  shares of suntron common stock 
beginning in the first quarter of  the combination will be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control  which is similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
accordingly  beginning in the first quarter of  our consolidated financial statements will consist of the combined results of eftc since its inception and k tec operating company  llc since october  the date that common control was established 
however  because the combination was completed in the first quarter of  the financial statements for the years ended december  and included in this report have not been restated to reflect the combination 
except as expressly noted  all references in this report to our financial results prior to january  reflect the historical financial results of eftc and its subsidiaries and do not include the historical financial results of k tec and its subsidiaries 
accordingly  we believe that our historical financial results included in this report are not indicative of the financial results of suntron as a combined company 
the corresponding consolidated financial statements of k tec for the fiscal year ended december   as well as pro forma combined consolidated financial information  will be included in a current report on form k a  which we expect to file with the sec in the near future 
between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of  eftc implemented a series of actions to improve liquidity and operating results 
these actions  which are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements  included the disposition and closure of eftc business units 
moreover  as more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements  eftc engaged in a number of significant recapitalization transactions beginning in march because of the significant impact of these transactions  we believe that the financial results are not necessarily comparable on a period to period basis 
information about our business as an electronic manufacturing services company  many of our customers are original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that have designed their own products 
our customers request proposals that include key terms such as quality  delivery  and the price to purchase the materials and perform the manufacturing services to make one or more components or assemblies 
generally  the component or assembly that we manufacture is delivered to the customer where it is then integrated into their final product 
we price new business with our customers by obtaining quotes from our suppliers and then estimating the amount of labor and overhead that will be required to make the products 
before we begin a customer relationship  we typically enter into arrangements that are intended to protect us in case a customer cancels an order after we have purchased the raw materials to fill that order 
if an order is cancelled  the customer is generally required to purchase the materials or reimburse us if we incur a loss from liquidating the raw materials 
despite these arrangements  it is not unusual for us to incur losses on inventories 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is extremely dynamic and our customers make frequent changes to their orders 
the magnitude and frequency of these changes make it difficult to predict revenues beyond the next quarter  and even relatively short term forecasts may prove inaccurate depending on changes in economic  political  and military factors  as well as unexpected customer requests to delay shipments near the end of our fiscal quarters 
these changes in customer orders also cause substantial difficulties in managing inventories  which often leads to excess inventories and the need to recognize losses on inventories 
however  from time to time  we may also have difficulties obtaining certain electronic components that are in short supply  which can result in a decision to purchase some materials before formal notice of demand is received from our customer 
in addition  our inventories consist of over  different parts and many of these parts have limited alternative uses or markets  except in the products that we manufacture for our customers 
when we liquidate excess materials through an inventory broker or auction  we often realize less than of the original cost of the materials  and in some cases we determine that there is no market for the excess materials 
the most common reasons we incur losses are if we purchase more materials than are necessary to meet a customer s requirements or if we fail to move quickly to minimize losses once the customer communicates a cancellation 
occasionally it is not clear what action caused an inventory loss and there is a shared responsibility whereby our customers agree to negotiate a settlement with us 
accordingly  on a quarterly basis management evaluates inventory on hand  forecasted demand  contractual protections  and net realizable values in order to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying amount of inventory is necessary 
when the relationship with a customer terminates  we tend to be more vulnerable to inventory losses because the customer may be reluctant to accept responsibility for the remaining inventory if a product is at the end of its life cycle 
we can also incur inventory losses if a customer becomes insolvent and the materials do not have alternative uses or markets into which we can sell them 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation 
the recent combination of eftc and k tec will be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control 
under this method of accounting  we will be required to combine the operating results of k tec since october  when common control was established 
however  since this acquisition did not close in  we are required to exclude k tec s results from the and financial statements included in this report  even though all future presentations of and financial results will require that we combine the results of k tec as if the merger had occurred on october  accordingly  our historical financial results included in this report are not indicative of the combined results that will be retroactively reported beginning in the first quarter of write downs for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
our judgments about excess and obsolete inventories are especially difficult because i hundreds of different components may be associated with a single product we manufacture for a customer  ii we make numerous products for most of our customers  iii even though we are engaged in the electronic manufacturing services industry  most of our customers are engaged in diverse industries  and iv all of our customers experience dynamic business environments affected by a wide variety of economic  political  and regulatory factors 
this complex environment results in positive and negative events that can change daily and which affect judgments about future demand for our manufacturing services and the amounts we can realize when it is not possible to liquidate inventories through production of finished products 
we frequently review customer demand to determine if we have excess raw materials that will not be consumed in production 
in determining demand we consider firm purchase orders and forecasts of demand submitted by our customers 
if we determine that excess inventories exist and that the customer is not contractually obligated for the excess inventories  we need to make judgments about whether unforecasted demand for those materials is likely to occur or the amount we would likely realize in the sale of this material through a broker or auction 
if we determine that future demand from the customer is unlikely  we write down our inventories to the extent that the cost of the inventory exceeds the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in future periods 
likewise  if we underestimate contractual recoveries from customers or future demand  hindsight may indicate that we over reported our costs of goods sold in earlier periods  which results in the recognition of additional gross profit at the time the material is used in production and the related goods are sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or the outcome of customer negotiations with respect to the enforcement of contractual provisions  could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
when we undergo changes in our business  including the closure or relocation of facilities  we often have equipment and other assets that are no longer needed in our business 
when this occurs  we estimate how much we believe we are likely to receive upon disposal of the assets and we record an impairment charge if this amount is less than the net carrying value 
if actual market conditions for these assets are less favorable than those projected by management  additional impairment charges may be required 
through  we evaluated goodwill associated with our business acquisitions for potential impairment indicators 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators was based on operational performance of the acquired businesses and existing market conditions 
effective january   we will be required to implement a new accounting standard that requires an evaluation of impairment of goodwill based on the current fair value of the reporting unit to which it relates 
any resulting impairment loss from the adoption of this new accounting standard  or the periodic testing required in future periods  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
income taxes 
in through  we incurred net losses in excess of million 
the year was the first year out of the last four in which we have reported net income and taxable income 
these earlier losses generated a sizeable federal tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforward of approximately million as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to our history of unprofitable operations  we have not recognized a benefit for any of this net deferred tax asset 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels that cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates  rather than the rate currently being used 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
overview of statement of operations we recognize revenue when title is transferred to our customers  which generally occurs upon shipment from our facilities 
our gross sales are reduced by an allowance for returns to arrive at the net sales reported in our financial statements 
currently  we do not have non cancelable long term contracts with our customers 
cost of goods sold includes materials  labor  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture of our products 
cost of goods sold also includes charges for obsolete and slow moving inventories and charges for impairment of long lived assets used in our manufacturing operations 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  and production volume 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our suppliers 
our operating expenses are classified into six general categories selling  general  and administrative  recapitalization and merger transaction costs  severance  retention  closure  and relocation costs  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill amortization  and litigation settlement costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  and human resources personnel  salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and marketing costs  insurance expenses  depreciation expense related to assets not used in manufacturing activities  and professional fees for auditing and legal assistance and general corporate expenses 
recapitalization and merger transaction costs relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with the recapitalization in  which is described in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these costs included fees for legal  accounting  and management consulting services  financial advisory fees  and costs related to the special meeting of shareholders to approve the transaction 
recapitalization and merger transaction costs also include costs incurred in connection with the business combination between eftc and k tec  which is described in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the costs included fees primarily related to a fairness opinion and professional fees for the combination and related securities and exchange commission filings 
the business combination will be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control  and  accordingly  these costs were charged to operations when the costs were incurred 
severance  retention  closure  and relocation costs include charges incurred for severance and retention costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters from denver to phoenix and other changes in management in  the estimated loss on the sublease of the denver facility  moving and relocation costs  and recruiting fees 
impairment of long lived assets includes charges for long lived assets not used in manufacturing activities and relate primarily to the dispositions  closures  and relocation of facilities described in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
goodwill amortization expenses include the amortization of goodwill relating to the acquisition of current electronics  inc litigation settlement expenses relate to the settlement of a class action lawsuit  which is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
interest expense relates to our senior credit facility and other long term debt obligations 
interest expense also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs 
gain loss on sale of assets resulted primarily from the sale of the services division  assets related to a plant in tucson  arizona  and assets related to a plant closure in ft 
lauderdale  florida 
these transactions are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by several factors  primarily the level and timing of customer orders especially orders from honeywell 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  changes in the customer s manufacturing strategy  and variation in demand for its products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
in the past  changes in orders from customers have had a significant effect on our quarterly results of operations 
see factors that may affect our future results our results of operations will be affected by a variety of factors  which could cause our results of operations to fail to meet expectations and our stock price to decline 
the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december    and as indicated above  the balance of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects only eftc s historical results and not the results of k tec 
net sales cost of goods sold gross profit loss operating costs and expenses selling  general  and administrative recapitalization and merger transaction costs severance  retention  closure  and relocation costs impairment of long lived assets goodwill amortization litigation settlement operating income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in this reflects an approximately million increase in sales to honeywell almost all of which is attributable to manufacturing services from our phoenix facility  partially offset by reduced sales to a number of other customers 
approximately of our net sales in related to manufacturing services for honeywell at our phoenix plant  compared to approximately in the overall concentration of business with honeywell increased from of our net sales in to of our net sales in we expect our net sales to increase and our overall concentration of business with honeywell to decrease as a result of the combination of eftc and k tec  which occurred in the first quarter of gross profit 
our gross profit increased million from million in to million in similarly  gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved from of net sales in to of net sales in the improvement in gross profit in is primarily attributable to an overall improvement in capacity utilization and operational efficiency at our facilities and a more favorable product mix with our customers 
the improvement in capacity utilization was driven by changes initiated in and  including the closure of our ft 
lauderdale facility and the sale of the assets of our tucson facility 
the ft 
lauderdale and tucson facilities generated a combined gross profit deficiency of million in gross profit in was also negatively impacted by approximately million related to the transition of additional manufacturing services under the honeywell agreement in the first quarter of in  we assessed certain long lived assets for impairment related to the planned move to a new facility in the northeast and the abandonment of manufacturing related software that is no longer expected to be used 
due to changes in our customers and product mix  we also assessed the carrying value of intellectual property and manufacturing equipment related to those customers in accordingly  we recognized impairment expense of million that is included in cost of goods sold in inventory write downs decreased from million  or of net sales  in to million  or of net sales  in during  we recognized inventory write downs of million for excess inventories related to honeywell and several smaller customers  approximately million related to customer disengagements  and approximately million related to the ft 
lauderdale and tucson inventories 
in  we recognized charges of million for excess inventories related to a variety of customers  million related to an existing customer that discontinued a product line  approximately million due to customer disengagements  and approximately million related to inventory for a customer experiencing financial difficulties and for which we do not expect to realize the value through production or other means of liquidation 
over the past year we have focused substantial efforts to improve our inventory management processes and to work more closely with our customers to minimize losses due to excess inventories 
these efforts were primarily responsible for the reduction in inventory write downs in actual dollars and as a percentage of net sales in compared to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  from million in to million in sg a expenses in included million for consulting services intended to accelerate operational improvement at each of our facilities 
sg a in also included a charge of million for accelerated depreciation and amortization of assets that were not expected to be utilized after the relocation of eftc s corporate headquarters to phoenix 
finally  the results in included approximately million for sg a at divisions that were sold or closed by the end of september after excluding all of the charges discussed above  sg a expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in despite an increase in sales in  sg a expenses have remained stable  primarily due to the elimination of costs as a result of the closure of the denver headquarters in the fourth quarter of we expect our sg a expenses to increase as a result of the combination 
recapitalization and merger transaction costs 
recapitalization and merger transaction costs decreased million  or  from million in to million in in connection with the march recapitalization  we incurred charges totaling million  including million for financial advisor fees paid to unrelated parties  a fee of million paid to thayer blum funding  costs of million related to a shareholder meeting to approve the recapitalization  and costs for legal  accounting  and management consultant services of million 
we capitalized costs associated with the issuance of senior subordinated exchangeable notes and a revolving credit agreement  and all other costs were charged to operations in in  we incurred costs  primarily for a fairness opinion and professional fees  of million related to the combination with k tec that was completed on february  this business combination will be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control  and  accordingly  these costs were charged to operations when the costs were incurred 
severance  retention  closure  and relocation costs 
we recognized charges totaling million in for severance  recruiting  and other costs associated with changes in management and the relocation of corporate headquarters 
because the management team was in place and corporate headquarters was relocated by the fourth quarter of  we did not incur charges for similar activities in impairment of long lived assets 
in  we recognized an impairment charge of million  including million for software that we decided to abandon 
during  we recognized impairment of manufacturing assets  but the amounts were charged to cost of goods sold as discussed above under the caption gross profit 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings 
our outstanding debt decreased from million at december  to approximately million at december  the decreased debt level at december  was primarily due to the conversion of million of debt to common stock on may  the reduction in debt was also attributable to improved working capital management in  which resulted in the repayment of nearly million of debt under our revolving credit agreement and a million note payable owed to a director 
lower interest rates in also contributed to the reduction in interest expense 
the interest rate on the million of exchangeable notes that were outstanding during the second and third quarters of accrued interest at compared to the reduced rate of that went into effect after the recapitalization was approved by our shareholders in august additionally  the prime rate decreased by nearly five percentage points in  and this also had a favorable impact because the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is a variable rate based on the prime rate 
our debt level has increased as a result of the combination 
following the combination  we are now a party to the credit facility with citicorp usa that k tec entered into in january as of march   we had borrowed million under this credit facility 
as of march   we also had million of debt payable to the former parent of k tec 
gain loss on sale of assets 
during  we recognized a loss of million in connection with the sale of substantially all of the assets of our services division 
the loss gave effect to the deferral of million of the proceeds for a post closing earn out contingency 
during  the purchaser agreed to pay million under the earn out contingency provision of the sales agreement 
accordingly  we recognized a gain of million in  consisting of million of the proceeds that we were entitled to retain and the additional consideration of million that the purchaser agreed to pay 
however  in the fourth quarter of we notified the purchaser that we believed we were entitled to a higher payment than the million that they calculated 
in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the earn out calculation 
as a result of this agreement  we received a final payment of million that accounted for million of the gain on sale of assets in in  we also recognized a gain of million from the sale of equipment 
income taxes 
due to significant net losses in and  we have recorded a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets 
based on the level of earnings generated in  we determined that an income tax provision of million should be recognized 
this provision was due to a valuation allowance for federal alternative minimum taxes payable for and a provision for state income taxes at locations where the state net operating loss carryovers were not sufficient to offset taxable income for utilization of our net operating loss carryovers is subject to limitation as a result of the change in ownership of eftc that occurred during year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
we experienced major changes in our customers and facilities since the beginning of at the start of  we had facilities 
six of these facilities were either sold or closed by december  however  we also added facilities in phoenix and mexico during to support the new business with honeywell 
approximately of our sales for the year ended december  were made under the honeywell agreement at the phoenix location as opposed to of our sales in however  this increased revenue from honeywell was offset by the loss of revenue from the services division that was sold on september   and our tucson assets that were sold on february  the services division and the tucson assets generated revenue of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period of after eliminating sales excluding sales related to customers that agreed to transition the manufacture of their products to another facility operated by us related to facilities that were either closed or sold  adjusted net sales for amounted to million compared to million for  which is an increase of million  or 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to an increase in sales generated at our phoenix location to honeywell 
gross profit loss 
we realized gross profit of in compared to a loss of in this loss was primarily attributable to charges related to decisions to sell assets and close certain facilities  including the rocky mountain operations  the services division  the southeast operations and the tucson facility 
the operations sold or closed accounted for a loss of million during compared to a loss of million for during  product pricing at the tucson facility resulted in negative margins of million 
during  we recognized inventory write downs of million  or of net sales 
this compares to million for the year ended december   or of net sales 
during  we recognized a charge of million that was necessary due to customer disengagements  million related to inventories for which we could not realize our carrying cost when we sold the services division  million under a negotiated settlement related to a dispute with honeywell with respect to excess inventories at the fort lauderdale plant  and million for excess inventories related to a variety of continuing customers 
as a result of the significant charges that we incurred in  during we renegotiated customer agreements  focused substantial efforts to improve our inventory management processes  and began working more closely with customers to minimize charges due to excess inventories 
these efforts were primarily responsible for the reduction in inventory write downs as a percentage of net sales in compared to however  despite these efforts  we recognized inventory write downs in of million related to customer disengagements  million of additional write downs related to the fort lauderdale and tucson inventories  and million for excess inventories related to honeywell and a variety of smaller customers 
in addition to poor performance at the facilities that were sold or closed  our other facilities also performed poorly due to capacity utilization issues  difficulties in dealing with rapid growth issues at the new phoenix plant  and difficulties in managing a business that was undergoing dramatic and complex changes at a time when financial resources were not adequate 
the improvement in gross profit during was due to higher capacity utilization at most of our facilities 
the improvement in capacity utilization has been partially offset by generally higher compensation and benefits costs during compared to during the second half of  profitability was favorably impacted by heightened management focus on operational issues and the renegotiation of unfavorable contracts with customers 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses decreased to million during compared to million in sg a expenses for the year ended december  includes million for consulting services intended to accelerate operational improvement at each of our facilities 
sg a expenses for include a charge of million for accelerated depreciation and amortization of assets that could not be used after we relocated the corporate headquarters and million for sg a expenses at divisions that were sold or closed by the end of for  sg a expenses included charges to bad debt expense of million  primarily due to a loss of million that was recognized due to settlements reached with honeywell with respect to business conducted at the fort lauderdale and tucson facilities  and million for uncollectible receivables related to the services division  which was sold in september for  sg a also includes million of other costs related to the divisions that were sold or closed  and approximately million for start up costs at the phoenix facility 
after excluding all of the charges discussed above  sg a expense for amounted to million compared to million in the increase in sg a in is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of million  and information technology expenses of million 
severance  retention  closure  and relocation costs 
we also recognized charges of million in for severance  recruiting  and other costs associated with changes in management and the relocation of corporate headquarters 
this compares to million in that was primarily attributable to severance costs for administrative employees in connection with the closure of the southeast division 
recapitalization transaction costs 
in connection with the recapitalization described below  during  we incurred charges totaling million for financial advisor fees  a fee paid to thayer blum funding  and due diligence costs for legal  accounting  and management consultants 
we capitalized costs directly associated with the march and july exchangeable notes and a revolving credit agreement with bank of america  and all other costs were charged to operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
during  we recognized an impairment charge of million 
this charge consists of million for software that was abandoned and an additional million for impaired equipment related to headquarters and plant closures 
for  we recognized impairment expense of million that was incurred in connection with the sale and closure of four divisions 
for  we recognized million of impairment related to equipment at the ft 
lauderdale facility  million for the tucson assets that were held for sale at year end  million for services group assets that were sold in september  and million for impaired assets at other locations 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization for amounted to million compared to million in the decrease in was attributable to the sale of the services division on september   and the corresponding write off of million of goodwill that was included in the calculation of the loss on sale of the services division 
litigation settlement 
in  we recognized a provision of million for the settlement of litigation that was initiated in interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million in for the year ended december   our weighted average borrowings were million compared to million during the increased debt level in is attributable to the issuance of million of march exchangeable notes that accrued interest at until august  upon stockholder approval of the issuance of the convertible notes  on august  the march exchangeable notes were exchanged for convertible notes that bear interest at 
eftc also incurred interest expense at a rate of on the million of july exchangeable notes for days 
the july exchangeable notes were exchanged for convertible preferred stock on august  in addition to the higher rate on the exchangeable notes  during interest expense was adversely affected by increases in the prime rate  which impacted the interest rate on the revolving credit facility 
gain loss on sale of assets 
during  we recognized a loss of million in connection with the sale of substantially all of the assets of the services division due to the write off of million of goodwill from the acquisition of the services division 
the loss gave effect to the deferral of million of the proceeds for a post closing earn out contingency 
during  we were paid million under the earn out contingency agreed to with the purchaser in connection with the sale of the services division 
accordingly  we recognized a gain of million in  consisting of million of the proceeds that we were entitled to retain and additional consideration of million that was received in income tax benefit expense 
due to significant net losses in  we recorded a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded deferred tax expense of million in despite a pre tax loss of million 
due to significant net losses in and  we recorded a valuation allowance for all of the net deferred tax assets again in liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared with net cash used in operating activities of million in the difference between our net income in of million and million operating cash flow was primarily attributable to a million decrease in trade receivables  a reduction in inventories of million  million of depreciation and amortization expense  a million provision for excess and obsolete inventories  a million increase in interest on convertible debt  a provision for uncollectible accounts receivable of million  and an impairment charge of million  partially offset by a reduction of million in accounts payable and the payment of million for severance  retention  closure  and relocation costs 
days sales outstanding based on net sales for the year ended december  and net trade receivables outstanding on that date decreased to days for the year ended december   compared to days for the comparable period of days sales outstanding in were affected favorably by a new financing program for a substantial portion of our receivables 
inventories decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  for the year ended december   inventory turns ie  annualized net sales divided by period end inventory amounted to times per year 
this compares to times for the year ended december  during  one of our biggest challenges involved financing the higher levels of inventories required to support increased sales at our phoenix facility 
during the last nine months of and much of  these difficulties worsened because of industry wide shortages of components that ultimately delayed shipment of finished goods to customers 
by the fourth quarter of  the component shortages had diminished and we had generally improved our inventory management practices  which contributed to improved inventory turns in compared to cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million in investing cash flows in reflect million in capital expenditures including leasehold improvements of million at the new northeast facility  million for information technology assets  and million for new manufacturing equipment  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of assets 
the proceeds from asset sales included million received as a final settlement under the earn out provision from the september sale of the services division  and the release of million of proceeds from the february sale of tucson assets that were required to be released from escrow one year after closing 
in  we entered into a year operating lease that provides for annual payments of approximately million for a new manufacturing facility in lawrence  massachusetts 
this facility opened in october and replaces the facility in wilmington  massachusetts that provided for annual lease payments of approximately million 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million in financing cash flows in reflect a net repayment of borrowings under the revolving line of credit of million  the repayment of a million loan from a director  and a million reduction in outstanding checks in excess of cash balances 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   after giving effect to the february closing of the combination with k tec maturity date during years ending december after total long term debt bank of america citicorp   former parent of k tec   non cancelable operating leases former eftc facilities      former k tec facilities      total      we believe we will be able to fund contractual operating lease obligations from operating cash flows during the periods that payments are required 
we are currently involved in arbitration proceedings with respect to a dispute with the former parent of k tec 
depending on the resolution of these proceedings  our obligation to pay this debt may be reduced or eliminated 
however  even if we are required to pay the entire amount in  we believe adequate resources are available under our revolving line of credit with citicorp 
if we have not repaid outstanding borrowing from cash flow that may be generated over the next three years  upon maturity of the citicorp credit facility in we currently intend to enter into negotiations for a new credit agreement that provides for an extension of the maturity date 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard 
capital resources 
our working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  at december   the borrowing base under our million revolving credit facility with bank of america would have supported borrowings up to million and we only had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under that credit facility 
accordingly  we had unused availability of million under the bank of america credit facility as of december  at december   we also had cash and equivalents of million resulting in firm capital resources of million 
on february   the combination of eftc and k tec was completed  and eftc and k tec became wholly owned subsidiaries of suntron 
the credit facility with bank of america  na was repaid in march we are now a party to the credit facility with citicorp usa that k tec entered into in january this amended credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million  maturing in february borrowings under the amended credit facility currently bear interest at the prime rate plus for base rate borrowings and the libor rate plus for libor rate borrowings 
total borrowings are subject to limitation based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable  inventories  real estate  and equipment 
the credit agreement requires compliance with certain financial and non financial covenants 
the credit agreement also limits or prohibits us from paying dividends  incurring additional debt  selling significant assets  or merging with other entities without the consent of the lenders 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings 
in addition to the increase in debt from the february combination with k tec  our debt level also increased on march  in connection with our acquisition of midwestern electronics  inc  as discussed in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as of march   the borrowing base under our million revolving credit facility with citicorp supported borrowings up to million and we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under the credit facility  resulting in unused availability of million 
as of march   we also had million of debt payable to the former parent of k tec 
this debt will be reduced to the extent of a favorable outcome of arbitration proceedings that are in progress 
we believe that adequate capital resources are in place to fund our working capital and other cash requirements for the next months 
however  depending on the amount of capital resources that are devoted to any future acquisitions of businesses  and increased working capital requirements if sales levels increase in  we may need to seek additional funds through public or private debt or equity offerings  bank borrowings or leasing arrangements 
the continued availability of our credit facility with citicorp is a critical assumption underlying our belief that adequate capital resources are currently in place to fund our planned activities for the next months 
the borrowing base calculation under this credit facility is based on a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories  plus the appraised value of certain real estate and equipment 
accordingly  our borrowing availability decreases as our net receivables and inventories decline 
however  the borrowing base generally increases as our receivables and inventories increase 
if our sales begin to increase rapidly  this credit facility is critical to enable us to finance the increased working capital requirements associated with growth 
we are also required to comply with certain financial and reporting covenants that must be adhered to in order to ensure the continuous availability of funding under this credit facility 
if we are unable to comply with all of our covenants  the credit facility could be withdrawn and this would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  resulting in the need to seek other sources of financing 
there is no assurance that we would be successful in securing additional financing  and even if we would be successful  the terms may be less favorable than we currently have with citicorp 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
statement no 
addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of statement no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  the provisions also apply to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july  or later 
we are required to adopt the provisions of statement no 
beginning in the first quarter of the effect of these statements on us will be the elimination of the amortization of goodwill that is currently being amortized over years and the requirement to begin testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least on an annual basis 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with the adoption of statements and  it is not currently practicable to estimate the impact of adopting those statements on our consolidated financial statements 
however  any resulting impairment loss from the adoption of this new accounting standard could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
management does not believe the initial application of statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
statement requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
statement also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  are to be applied prospectively 
management does not believe the initial application of statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the factors described below  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report  in analyzing an investment in our common stock 
if any of the events described below occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer  the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of the money you paid for our common stock 
in addition  the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  whether made in this k  our annual or quarterly reports to shareholders  future press releases  sec filings or orally  whether in presentations  responses to questions or otherwise 
see statement regarding forward looking statements 
our inability to successfully integrate our operations may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the recent business combination of eftc and k tec 
the success of the combination will depend on our ability to unite eftc s business strategies and technologies with those of k tec 
the difficulties of combining eftc s operations with those of k tec include the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations and integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds 
combining management from eftc and k tec will result in changes affecting all employees and operations 
differences in management approach and corporate culture may strain employee relations 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined businesses and the loss of key personnel 
we may encounter difficulties in the process of integrating the businesses of eftc and k tec  which could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination  including expected synergies from cost cutting initiatives and cross selling of products and services across customers and geographic regions 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the combination and the integration of the two operations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
the combination may result in a loss of customers and employees  which could harm our results of operations 
the combination could cause certain customers to either seek alternative sources of product supply or service  or delay or change orders for products due to uncertainty over the integration of the two companies or the strategic position of the combined company 
as a result  we may experience some customer attrition 
any customer attrition could harm our results of operations 
difficulties in integrating the operations of eftc and k tec  including the uncertainty related to organizational changes  could also negatively affect employee morale and result in the loss of key employees 
we may not be able to retain key management  sales  marketing  and technical personnel 
any steps taken by us to address customer and employee attrition may not be effective  and this attrition could negatively affect our results of operations 
we have experienced declining net sales 
eftc s net sales declined from million in the first quarter of to million in the second quarter of  million in the third quarter of  and million in the fourth quarter of k tec s net sales declined from million in the first quarter of to million in the second quarter of  and million in the third quarter of we are in the process of compiling k tec s fourth quarter results 
we expect k tec s net sales for the fourth quarter will decline up to sequentially from third quarter net sales 
we are dependent on the aerospace industry  and recent terrorist attacks may negatively impact our results of operations 
our principal customer is engaged in the aerospace market 
see we are dependent upon a small number of customers for a large portion of our net sales  and a decline in sales to major customers would harm our results of operations 
consequently  a significant percentage of our net sales will be derived from the aerospace segment of the electronics industry  and a significant decline in the aerospace market could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the september  terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington  dc using hijacked commercial aircraft have been highly publicized 
we believe that these events have had an adverse impact on our recent results of operations 
see eftc and k tec have each experienced declining net sales 
the long term impact is not known at this time  but may include reduced demand for products of our aerospace customers  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we are dependent upon the electronics industry and excess capacity or decreased demand for products produced by this industry could result in increased price competition as well as a decrease in our gross margins and unit volume sales 
our business is heavily dependent on the electronics industry 
a significant percentage of our net sales are generated from the aerospace and defense  semiconductor capital equipment  industrial controls and instrumentation  medical equipment  networking and telecommunications equipment segments of the electronics industry  which is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand 
furthermore  these segments are subject to economic cycles and have experienced in the past  and are likely to experience in the future  recessionary periods 
a recession or any other event leading to excess capacity or a downturn in these segments of the electronics industry could result in intensified price competition as well as a decrease in our gross margins and unit volume sales 
we are dependent upon a small number of customers for a large portion of our net sales  and a decline in sales to major customers would harm our results of operations 
a small number of customers will be responsible for a significant portion of our net sales 
sales to honeywell represented approximately of eftc s sales in sales to applied materials and emulex represented approximately and  respectively  of k tec s sales for the nine months ended september  we expect a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be generated by a small number of customers 
our customer concentration could increase or decrease depending on future customer requirements  which will depend in large part on market conditions in the electronics industry segments in which our customers participate 
the loss of one or more major customers or a decline in sales to our major customers could significantly harm our business and results of operations and lead to declines in the price of our common stock 
if we are not able to expand our customer base  we will continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net sales 
despite existing contractual arrangements  there can be no assurance that current customers  including honeywell  applied materials  emulex  or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing services to our customers 
if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable or unwilling to pay for our services  our results of operations would be harmed 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  or delay production 
electronics manufacturing service providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  or delay production for a number of reasons 
cancellations  reductions  or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers would seriously harm our results of operations 
we purchase inventory based on customer forecasts and firm purchase orders  which we may be forced to write off to the extent customer orders are changed or cancelled 
in addition  we may be forced to hold excess inventories and incur carrying costs as a result of delays  cancellations  or reductions in orders or poor forecasting by our key customers 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs  and other resource requirements based on estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to estimate accurately future customer requirements 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margins and operating income 
conversely  customers may on occasion require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce margins  and we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers demands 
our results of operations will be affected by a variety of factors  which could cause our results of operations to fail to meet expectations and our stock price to decline 
eftc s and k tec s results of operations have varied  and our results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
our results of operations will be affected by a number of factors  including timing of orders from and shipments to major customers  mix of products ordered by major customers  volume of orders as related to our capacity at individual locations  pricing and other competitive pressures  component shortages  which could cause us to be unable to meet customer delivery schedules  our ability to minimize inventory obsolescence and bad debt expense risk  our ability to manage effectively inventory and fixed asset levels  our ability to time expenditures in anticipation of future sales  and timing and level of goodwill amortization or asset impairments 
our results of operations can also be significantly influenced by development and introduction of new products by our customers 
from time to time  we may experience changes in the volume of sales to our principal customers  and results of operations may be affected on a period to period basis by these changes 
see our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  or delay production 
our results of operations for the first quarter of may also be adversely affected by the recognition of transitional impairment losses upon the initial application of recently issued accounting standards 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
in addition  fluctuations in results of operations may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
as of march   we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately million 
in addition  subject to the restrictions under our various debt agreements  we may incur significant additional indebtedness from time to time to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
our level of debt could have negative consequences 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions by making it more difficult to borrow additional funds to maintain our operations if we suffer revenue shortfalls  limit our ability to attract new customers if we do not have sufficient liquidity to meet working capital needs  hinder our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry by preventing us from borrowing money to upgrade our equipment or facilities  and limit or impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process development  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to develop and market products that meet changing customer needs  and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
we expect that the investment necessary to maintain our technological position will increase as customers make demands for products and services requiring more advanced technology on a quicker turnaround basis 
we may not be able to borrow additional funds in order to respond to technological changes as quickly as our competitors 
in addition  the electronics manufacturing services industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market 
if we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of those technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments 
we are dependent on limited and sole source suppliers for electronic components and may experience component shortages  which would cause us to delay shipments to customers  resulting in potential declines in net sales and results of operations 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide critical electronic components and other materials for our operations 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components we use  and suppliers of some components have lacked sufficient capacity to meet the demand for these components 
for example  from time to time  some components we use  including semiconductors  capacitors  and resistors  have been subject to shortages  and suppliers have been forced to allocate available quantities among their customers 
such shortages have disrupted our operations in the past  which resulted in incomplete or late shipments of products to our customers 
our inability to obtain any needed components during future periods of allocations could cause delays in shipments to our customers 
the inability to make scheduled shipments could in turn cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue 
we could also experience negative customer goodwill due to the delay in shipment 
component shortages may also increase our cost of goods due to premium charges we may pay to purchase components in short supply 
accordingly  even though component shortages have not had a lasting negative impact on our business  component shortages could harm our results of operations for a particular fiscal period due to the resulting revenue shortfall or cost increases and could also damage customer relationships over a longer term period 
if we experience excess capacity due to variability in customer demand  our gross margins may fall 
we may schedule certain of our production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to additional quick turnaround orders 
however  if these orders are not made  we may forego some production and could experience excess capacity 
when we experience excess capacity  our sales revenue may be insufficient to fully cover our fixed overhead expenses and our gross margins will fall 
conversely  we may not be able to capture all potential revenue in a given period if our customers demands for quick turnaround services exceed our capacity during that period 
our inability to expand our web based supply chain management system could negatively impact our future competitiveness 
our future success depends in part on our ability to rapidly respond to changing customer needs by scaling operations to meet customers requirements  shift capacity in response to product demand fluctuations  procure materials at advantageous prices  manage inventory  and effectively distribute products to our customers 
in order to continue to meet these customer requirements  we have developed a web based supply chain management system that enables us to collaborate with our customers on product content and to process engineering changes 
we are currently implementing an enhanced version of our existing system  which will include real time communications between our customers across all of our facilities 
our inability to expand this web based system or delays or defects in such expansion could negatively impact our ability to manage our supply chain in an efficient and timely manner to meet customer demands  which could adversely affect our competitive position and negatively affect our ability to be competitive in the electronics manufacturing services industry 
we may expand our business into new products and services and may not be able to compete effectively with other companies who have been in these businesses longer than we have 
in the future  we may broaden our service offerings by providing new products and services 
if we do this  we will likely compete with companies that have substantially greater financial and manufacturing resources than we have and who have been providing these services longer than we have 
we may not be able to compete successfully on this basis with more established competitors 
our industry is extremely competitive 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is extremely competitive and includes hundreds of companies 
the contract manufacturing services we provide are available from many independent sources  and we compete with numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing services firms  including solectron corporation  smtc corporation  benchmark electronics  inc  pemstar  inc  plexus corp  group technologies corporation  sanmina corporation  flextronics international ltd  act manufacturing  inc  manufacturers services  ltd  celestica inc  jabil circuit  inc  and others 
many of such competitors are more established in the industry and have substantially greater financial  manufacturing or marketing resources than us 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors  and raw material suppliers and have lower cost structures 
in addition  certain of our competitors have broader geographic presence  including manufacturing facilities in foreign countries 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our targeted market are quality  reliability  ability to meet delivery schedules  technological sophistication  geographic location  and price 
we also face competition from our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the relative merits of internal manufacturing versus contract manufacturing for various products 
in recent years  many participants in our industry have substantially expanded their manufacturing capacity 
if overall demand for electronics manufacturing services decreases  this increased capacity could result in substantial pricing pressures  which could seriously harm our operating results 
we may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions  and these risks could harm our results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 
in  we acquired substantially all of the assets of midwestern electronics  inc  and we anticipate that we may seek to identify and acquire additional suitable businesses in the electronics manufacturing services industry 
acquisitions of companies and businesses and expansion of operations involve certain risks  including the following the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale  or other value  diversion of management s attention  difficulties in scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites  the possible need to restructure  modify  or terminate customer relationships of the acquired business  loss of key employees of acquired operations  and the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses 
accordingly  we may experience problems in integrating the operations associated with any future acquisition 
we therefore cannot assure you that any future acquisition will result in a positive contribution to our results of operations 
in particular  the successful combination with any businesses we acquire will require substantial effort from each company  including the integration and coordination of sales and marketing efforts 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process  including the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of any business acquired  problems associated with integration of management information and reporting systems  and delays in implementation of consolidation plans  could harm our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any future acquisition 
any failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could harm our business and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time write offs  and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in increased amortization or impairment expense 
these factors could harm our business and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects  which could result in reduced demand for our services and increased liability claims 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications  which are highly complex and may contain design or manufacturing errors or failures despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component failure or error  may result in delayed shipments  customer dissatisfaction  or a reduction or cancellation of purchase orders 
if these defects occur either in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may be impaired 
because our products are used in products that are integral to our customers businesses  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers  for which we may be legally required to compensate them 
product liability litigation against us  even if it were unsuccessful  would be time consuming and costly to defend 
our management team has not worked together as a combined unit  which may make it more difficult to conduct and grow our business 
our management team has not worked together as a combined unit 
in addition  eftc s senior management team has only been working together since july after the completion of the initial stage of eftc s recapitalization by thayer blum 
if our management team cannot successfully work together  we may not be able to execute our business strategy or compete effectively 
any failure to manage the combined operations of eftc and k tec could harm our business and limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination 
our major stockholder controls us and could prevent a change of control or other business combination or could effect a short form merger without the approval of other stockholders 
thayer blum owns approximately of our common stock  and four of our nine directors are representatives of thayer blum 
the interests of thayer blum may not always coincide with those of our other stockholders  particularly if thayer blum decides to sell its controlling interest 
in addition  thayer blum will have sufficient voting power without the approval of suntron s other stockholders to elect the entire board of directors of suntron and  in general  to determine the outcome of various matters submitted to stockholders for approval  including fundamental corporate transactions 
thayer blum could cause us to take actions that we would not consider absent thayer blum s influence  or could delay  deter  or prevent a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our public stockholders 
in addition  thayer blum could contribute its suntron stock to a subsidiary corporation that  as a stockholder  then would have the ability under delaware law to merge with or into suntron without the approval of the other suntron stockholders 
in the event of such a short form merger  suntron stockholders would have the right to assert appraisal dissenters rights to receive cash in the amount of the fair market value of their shares in lieu of the consideration they would have otherwise received from the transaction 
our inability to manage our growth successfully may divert our resources and harm our results of operations 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to manage expected growth successfully 
our future results may also be impacted by our ability to execute future acquisitions and integrate the operations of acquired companies with our operations 
any further growth is likely to continue to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial  and other resources 
this growth will require us to implement additional management information systems  to further develop our operating  administrative  financial  and accounting systems and controls and to maintain close coordination among our accounting  finance  sales and marketing  and customer service and support departments 
in addition  we may be required to retain additional personnel to adequately support our growth 
if we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations  we may not be able to continue to grow  or we may grow at a slower pace 
any failure to successfully manage growth and to develop financial controls and accounting and operating systems or to add and retain personnel that adequately support growth could harm our business and financial results 
we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may need to raise additional funds for the following purposes to fund our operations  to fund any growth we experience  to enhance or expand the range of services we offer  to increase our promotional and marketing activities  or to respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities  such as investment  acquisition  and international expansion activities 
if such funds are not available when required or on acceptable terms  our business and financial results could suffer 
our manufacturing processes depend on the collective industry experience of our employees 
if these employees were to leave and take this knowledge with them  our manufacturing processes may suffer and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we have no patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes  but instead rely on the collective experience of our employees to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry 
although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees  if a significant number of employees involved in our manufacturing processes were to leave our employment and we are not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience  our manufacturing processes may suffer as we may be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry 
as a result  we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
we depend on our key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
our future success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  marketing  technical  and operational personnel  including james k 
bass  our president and chief executive officer 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees  except mr 
bass and r 
michael gibbons  one of our vice presidents 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management  technical  marketing  product development  operational personnel  and consultants 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
in addition  recent and potential future facility shutdowns and workforce reductions may have a negative impact on employee recruiting and retention 
our failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in fines and revocation of permits necessary to our manufacturing processes 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of such materials 
these laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as well as analogous state and foreign laws 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because our manufacturing processes use and generate materials classified as hazardous  such as ammoniacal etching solutions  copper  and nickel 
in addition  because we use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing processes  we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of our own sites or sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes  if such sites become contaminated 
even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination  we may still be liable 
the wastes we generate include spent ammoniacal etching solutions  solder stripping solutions  and hydrochloric acid solutions containing palladium  waste water that contains heavy metals  acids  cleaners  and conditioners  and filter cake from equipment used for on site waste treatment 
we have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the prior three years  and we believe that our operations substantially comply with all applicable environmental laws 
however  any material violations of environmental laws by us could subject us to revocation of our effluent discharge and other environmental permits 
any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  negatively impacting our net sales and causing our common stock price to decline 
even if we ultimately prevail  environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend 
environmental laws could also become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation 
we operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political  business  and environmental groups 
changes or restrictions on discharge limits  emissions levels  or material storage  handling  or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation 
it is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be exposed to intellectual property infringement claims by third parties that could be costly to defend  could divert management s attention and resources and  if successful  could result in liability 
we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement of third party proprietary rights  such as patents  from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
in certain cases  we may find it necessary or desirable to license or otherwise acquire rights to intellectual property held by others 
for example  in february  eftc settled a dispute with the lemelson foundation by entering into a license agreement that required eftc to make payments totaling approximately  over months 
other similar disputes could arise in the future 
these disputes could be costly to defend and could also result in the diversion of management time and attention 
in addition  adverse determinations in any proceedings could require us to pay monetary damages and could also result in loss of intellectual property rights 
in the event we were able to settle disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs of these licenses could be substantial 
accordingly  future disputes regarding intellectual property rights could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile  and our stock is thinly traded  which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in our stock 
the stock market has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
if market or industry based fluctuations continue  our stock price could decline regardless of our actual operating performance  and investors could lose a substantial part of their investments 
moreover  if an active public market for our stock is not sustained in the future  it may be difficult to resell our stock 
our stock is thinly traded 
the market price of our common stock will likely fluctuate in response to a number of factors  including the following failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our net sales and results of operations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions  and general stock market conditions 
recently  when the market price of a company s stock has been volatile  stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company 
if a class action lawsuit is filed against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and management time and attention would be diverted 
an adverse judgment could cause our financial condition or results of operations to suffer 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently have foreign operations in mexico 
we may in the future expand into other foreign countries 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations and in operating in foreign countries 
because of the scope of our international operations  we are subject to the following risks  which could adversely impact our results of operations economic or political instability  transportation delays and interruptions  increased employee turnover and labor unrest  incompatibility of systems and equipment used in foreign operations  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and diverse cultures  and less developed infrastructures 
in addition  changes in policies by the united states or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to increased duties  increased regulatory requirements  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations  restrictions on the transfer of funds  the imposition of or increase in tariffs  and limitations on imports or exports 
also  we could be negatively affected if our host countries revise their policies away from encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade  including tax holidays 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk following the recent combination of eftc and k tec  we replaced our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na with a million revolving line of credit with citicorp usa 
the interest rate on this loan is based either on the prime rate or libor rates  plus applicable margins 
therefore  as interest rates fluctuate  we may experience changes in interest expense that could impact financial results 
we have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements  or similar instruments  to protect against the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
assuming outstanding borrowings of million  if interest rates were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  the result would be an annual increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately  under this loan
