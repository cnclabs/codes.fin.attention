industry background communications technology has evolved from simple analog voice signals transmitted over networks of copper telephone lines to complex analog and digital voice and data signals transmitted over hybrid networks of media  such as copper  coaxial and fiber optic cables 
this evolution has been driven by large increases in the number of users and the complexity and variety of the data transmitted over networks  resulting from the substantial growth in the internet and its transformation from a text based medium to a multimedia platform containing pictures  video and sound  the growth of wireless communications  and the increased demand for remote network access and higher speed  higher bandwidth communication between lans  mans  and wans 
the majority of installed communications systems were designed to transmit only voice communications and  therefore  are inadequate for the high bandwidth transmission of both voice and data 
as a result  new equipment is being deployed to augment existing transmission media and increase their bandwidth 
access to the public network is typically based on asynchronous technologies  such as t e carrier over copper wire 
the demand for greater bandwidth is driving a migration from lower speed t e to higher speed t e transmission rates 
the t e standard permits the transmission of data at mbps mbps  and the t e standard permits the transmission of data at mbps mbps 
the backbone of the public network is built on an optical fiber transmission medium that employs synchronous technologies such as sonet sdh 
similar to the utilization of faster transmission rates over copper wire  sonet sdh protocols such as oc mbps and oc mbps are being upgraded to oc gbps and oc gbps to increase the bandwidth over a single optical fiber 
the market dynamics of the communications industry have changed significantly since many carriers that spent billions of dollars building out their networks in were not successful in executing their business models and consequently were sold or declared bankruptcy 
incumbent telephone companies such as at t  sprint  mci and worldcom and regional bell operating companies such as bellsouth  verizon and sbc have substantially scaled back their capital expenditures in an effort to bring them in line with historical spending levels 
this dynamic has severely impacted exar s customers  communications equipment oems  or original equipment manufacturers  many of which have undergone or are undergoing extensive restructuring to eliminate excess inventory and to reduce expenses by significantly downsizing their organizations 
at the same time  despite these economic setbacks  the company s oem customers are and will continue to come under tremendous pressure to develop new products for access and man markets that will enable carriers to leverage their current network infrastructure 
to address these evolving requirements of the communications industry  oems must develop and introduce increasingly sophisticated systems with fewer engineering resources 
to achieve the performance and functionality required of these systems  communications oems are using increasingly complex communications ics  which now account for a significant portion of the value added proprietary content of these systems 
as a result of the need for new equipment introductions  the reduction in their technical staff  the proliferation of transmission standards  and the difficulty of designing and producing communications ics  equipment suppliers are increasingly outsourcing the design and production of the ics incorporated into their systems 
these trends have created a significant opportunity for ic suppliers that can design cost effective solutions for high speed communications 
the worldwide t e carrier and related ic market is expected to grow over the next couple of years  with salomon smith barney  or ssb  estimating that it will reach million in potential revenue by in addition  ssb estimates that the sonet sdh ic market will grow to billion by the key ics contained in a typical communications system include physical interface  access control  network processor  traffic manager and switch fabric devices 
the physical interface device consists of a transmitter and receiver that  when integrated  is called a transceiver 
transceivers interface with the physical transmission media  such as copper wire or optical fiber 
most of these high speed  mixed signal ics convert parallel digital inputs into a single analog bit stream that is up to times faster than the original signal 
transceivers therefore serve as a bridge between analog transmission media and the digital devices that process data 
access control circuits are digital ics that format  or frame  the data  perform error checking and in some applications aggregate signals by mapping multiple lower speed data streams to a single higher speed stream 
the traffic manager manages the transfer of data between the network processor and the switch fabric  which work together to shape  route and control the data 
because physical interface and access control ics interface with the transmission media and are critical to increasing bandwidth  these ics must offer high speed and robust performance 
therefore  communications equipment oems seek ic suppliers that possess extensive analog and digital expertise to provide high speed  mixed signal solutions to bridge the analog physical world and the digital computing environment 
this must be coupled with system level expertise so that a supplier can quickly bring to market high performance  highly reliable ics with optimal feature sets

competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and a history of price reductions as production efficiencies are achieved in successive generations of products 
although the market for analog and mixed signal integrated circuits is generally characterized by longer product life cycles and less dramatic price reductions than the market for digital integrated circuits  the company faces substantial competition in each market in which it participates 
competition in the company s markets is based principally on technical innovation  product features  timely introduction of new products  quality and reliability  performance  price  technical support and service 
the company believes that it competes favorably in all of these areas 
because the ic markets are highly fragmented  the company generally encounters different competitors in its various market areas 
competitors with respect to the company s communications products include conexant systems  inc  pmc sierra and transwitch 
in addition  the expansion of the company s communications product portfolio may in the future bring it into competition with other established communications ic companies  such as applied micro circuits corporation and vitesse semiconductor 
competitors in the company s other markets include analog devices inc  philips electronics and texas instruments 
backlog exar defines backlog to include oem orders and distributor orders for which a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment occurring primarily during the succeeding six months 
at march   exar s backlog was million  compared with million at march  exar believes that the decrease in the company s backlog was due to a reduction in carrier capital expenditures and inventory accumulation within the communications product market 
additionally  the decrease in the backlog resulted from the shortened order to shipment time of the company s products 
over the past to months  the company has experienced increased percentage of orders received that shipped in the same quarter 
if this practice of short order to delivery times continue  the company s backlog may be less than in previous years and not a reliable indicator of future revenue 
sales are made pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery of standard items or agreements covering purchases over a period of time  which are frequently subject to revision and cancellation 
lead times for the release of purchase orders depend on the scheduling practices of the individual customer and the rate of bookings varies from month to month 
in addition  exar s distributor agreements generally permit the return of up to of the purchases annually for purposes of stock rotation and also provide for credits to distributors in the event that exar reduces the price of any product 
because of the possibility of changes in delivery schedules  quantities actually purchased  cancellations of orders  distributor returns or price reductions  exar s backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding six month period 
customers can cancel a significant portion  if not all  of their backlog at their discretion without substantial penalty 
intellectual property rights the company has patents issued and patent applications pending in the us the company has patents issued and patent applications pending in various foreign countries

overview exar designs  develops and markets high performance  high bandwidth mixed signal ics for use in the worldwide communications infrastructure 
the company s analog and digital design expertise  combined with its systems understanding  enables it to provide physical interface and access control solutions for access  man and wan communications equipment 
in addition  the company provides solutions for the serial communications market as well as the video and imaging markets 
the company currently offers ics based on the t e carrier and atm transmission standards and has recently introduced three products based on the sonet sdh transmission standards 
exar s products provide the following benefits to its users increased bandwidth through the integration of multiple channels on a single device  reduced overall system cost through the integration of multiple functions on a single device  accelerated time to market by allowing its customers to focus on core competencies and outsource standards based solutions 
the company s customers include adc telecommunications  inc  air prime  alcatel alsthom s 
a  ami inc  cisco systems  inc  digi international inc  hewlett packard company  lm ericsson telephone co  logitech international sa  lucent technologies  inc  marconi communications plc  nec  nokia corporation  rose electronics  siemens corporation and tellabs inc for the fiscal year ended march   one customer  hewlett packard  accounted for of the company s total sales 
no other customer accounted for more than of the company s total sales during this period 
over the past several years  the company has actively refocused its business on products for the communications market 
in the s  the company designed  manufactured and marketed custom and general purpose analog circuits supporting many different applications 
in the s  the company transitioned its products to analog and mixed signal application specific standard products  or assps  focusing on telecommunications  data communications  computer peripherals and consumer electronics 
through the mid s  the company continued this product transition through internal development and strategic acquisitions and moved to a fabless semiconductor business model 
in  the company leveraged its analog expertise by beginning to focus its product strategy and development efforts predominantly on the communications markets 
for the fiscal year ended march   the company s communications product sales represented of its net sales 
the company markets its products in the americas through independent sales representatives and non exclusive distributors as well as the company s own direct sales organization 
additionally  the company is represented in europe and asia pacific region by its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the company s international sales represented  and of net sales for the years ended march   and  respectively 
these international sales consist primarily of export sales from the united states that are denominated in united states dollars 
such international sales and operations expose the company to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the company s foreign operating expenses are denominated in foreign currency while its sales are denominated in united states dollars 
the company has adopted a set of practices to minimize its foreign currency risk  which include the occasional use of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the operating results of its foreign subsidiaries against this currency exchange risk 
although foreign sales within certain countries or foreign sales comprised of certain products may subject the company to tariffs  the company s profit margin on international sales of ics  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on the company s sales to domestic customers 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of several factors that could materially and adversely affect the company s future profitability  as described below in risk factors 
significant accounting policies and use of estimates the us securities and exchange commission the sec recently released fr cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  which encourages companies to disclose critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different financial results would be reported under different conditions or with the use of different assumptions 
such critical accounting policies  as defined by the sec  are those that are both most significant to the depiction of a company s financial condition and results  and require the use of difficult  subjective and complex judgment by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain 
the company s financial statements and accompanying disclosures  which are prepared in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  require that management use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period for which they are determined to be necessary 
exar s most critical accounting policies relate to net sales  reserves for excess inventories  income taxes  and investments in non public entities 
these accounting policies  the bases for the underlying estimates and the potential impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  should any of the estimates prove to be inaccurate  are further described below net sales net sales are comprised of product deliveries principally to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  contract manufacturers and non exclusive domestic distributors 
for the fiscal year ended march   and of net sales were derived from product sales to oems and non exclusive domestic distributors  respectively 
the company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
the company has agreements with its distributors  which provide for returns and allowances to the distributors 
the company records an allowance  at the time of delivery to the distributor  based on authorized and historical patterns of returns  price protection and other concessions 
the following is a description of the provisions of the agreements allowing the distributors certain volume based discounts  rights of return and price adjustments on unsold inventory 
a volume discounts 
the company provides for discounts based on volume ordered by a distributor for a specific product with a specified volume for a given customer over a period not to exceed one year 
exar records a provision for future volume discounts when the related revenue is recognized 
the provision is based on historical information and other known factors 
if the company s provision does not accurately reflect future volume discounts  the company s net sales could be materially and adversely affected 
b stock rotation 
the company allows a distributor to exchange products  in an amount of up to of the amount purchased in the prior three to six month period  provided that a purchase order from the distributor for an equal dollar amount of other products is in place at the same time of the exchange authorization 
the company uses historical information along with current market conditions and experiences to support the allowance recorded against sales for potential future stock rotation 
this allowance is recorded at the same time that revenue is recognized 
if the recorded allowance does not accurately reflect future stock rotations  the company s net sales could be materially and adversely affected 
c price protection 
the company provides credits to its distributors for subsequent price decreases 
price protection for distributors is a common practice within the markets in which the company competes 
distributors are informed of the price reductions and are required to submit an inventory on hand report to the company  which will then calculate the amount of the credit reflecting the charge against the allowance 
due to the proprietary nature of the company s products  the credits issued for price protection have been small in comparison to the credits issued for volume discount and stock rotation 
the company continuously reviews the pricing of its products in light of market conditions 
if the company s provision does not accurately reflect future price protection credits given to the distributor  the company s net sales could be materially and adversely affected 
as of march   the company had million of reserves for future volume discounts  stock rotation and price protection related to sales that were recorded during the fiscal year ended march  the company believes that it can estimate volume discounts  stock rotation and price protection allowances required by its distributors  with reasonable accuracy 
however  the company s actual experience could differ from its original estimated allowances  therefore requiring adjustments to revenues in the relevant period 
any adjustments to cost of sales would impact the results of operations 
inventories the company s policy is to establish a reserve against inventory supply in excess of approximately six months of forecasted demand  unless there are other factors indicating that the inventory will be sold at a profit after six months 
such factors include  among others  known backlog of orders  projected sales and marketing forecasts  shipment activity  inventory on hand at the company s distributors  past and current market conditions  anticipated demand for the company s products  and current business conditions when determining if a provision for excess inventory is required 
the company s net inventories at march  were million  compared with million at march  the decrease of million was primarily the result of product shipments from inventory on hand for the fiscal year ended march  should management s assumptions used in estimating the provision for excess inventory differ from actual future demand or should market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
deferred income tax assets income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
in the event that the company is unable to generate sufficient operating income in future periods  the deferred tax assets including the operating loss and credit carryforwards components of the deferred tax assets would not be realized  which would result in a write down of the deferred tax assets and a reduction of net income or an increase in net loss 
investments in non public entities exar holds a equity investment in internet machines corporation  or imc  a private company 
this investment is carried at the cost of million on the company s consolidated balance sheet as part of other long term investments 
because imc is a non public company  determining the market value of this investment is judgmental in nature and depends on management s assessment of imc s performance  among other factors 
management must assess  among other matters  the possibility of successful development and introduction of imc s new products at a point in time when the market is ready for this new technology 
this investment is subject to risks  including the risks that imc may not be successful in developing its planned technology and that a suitable market for such technology may not exist when imc markets it products  or that a competitor may develop a similar or superior product  or that the new products may fail to meet market demand 
should any of these or other risks materialize  this asset may become impaired 
in such case  the company would be required to write down the asset and record the related expense in the same period 
exar concluded that as of march   the carrying amount of this investment was not impaired 
the company has invested million in skypoint telecom fund ii us  lp  a venture capital fund 
the investment is carried at cost on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is contractually committed to fund an additional million to skypoint telecom fund ii us  lp the company reviews its investments periodically to determine if there has been a temporary or permanent decline in the market value of the investments below the value at which the company is carrying them on the balance sheet 
in assessing the potential of an impairment to the investment  the company considers the fund performance information provided by the fund s general partner together with other independent market information and makes an estimate of the future market potential of the venture capital fund 
if the company s assessment of the value of its investment is inconsistent with actual results  the company may be required to recognize impairment to the asset  resulting in additional expense on the company s consolidated income statements 
as of march   the company had invested million in techfarm ventures q  lp  and reduced the investment s carrying value on its balance sheet by the fund loss of  the company s capital commitment to the fund was approximately million  approximately of the total fund s committed capital 
the company had accounted for this investment in accordance with eitf d  accounting for limited partnership investments  through march  effective may   in connection with the resolution of a dispute between the parties  the company and techfarm ventures management llc  the general partner of techfarm ventures q  lp  a delaware limited partnership  agreed to reduce the company s capital commitment in the fund to approximately million  approximately of the total fund s committed capital 
this reduced equity position changes the company s method of accounting for this investment from the equity method to the cost basis 
additionally  the company and techfarm ventures management llc agreed to change the company s status from a limited partner to that of an assignee having less rights and status than a limited partner 
as of june   the company had fully satisfied its capital contribution obligation of million 
if the company s assessed the value of its investment falls below the carrying value  the company would be required to recognize impairment to the asset  resulting in additional expense on the company s consolidated income statements 
financial outlook for fiscal year the company anticipates that the current downturn in the communications equipment sector will continue into fiscal year however  the company believes that many of its customers have reduced their inventory levels and might increase their purchases 
the company has continued to have its core technology products designed into several of its customers new and enhanced networking equipment  contributing to the company s belief that it is well positioned to meet future demand as market conditions improve 
however  if the company s assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if the company continues to experience prolonged pressure on its bookings and backlog as a result of competition or declining market factors  the company s future results of operations may be negatively impacted 
the company expects to grow revenue sequentially in the first two quarters of fiscal however  due to continued poor visibility and expected delays in and or reductions of capital spending and overall market and economic uncertainties  the company expects that revenues will continue to be volatile and fluctuate as demand for the company s customers products changes and its customers corresponding inventory levels fluctuate 
the company anticipates that interest income will continue to decline in the first half of fiscal resulting from expected lower average yields on the company s marketable securities 
additionally  the company may consume cash throughout fiscal in excess of the receipt of cash  thereby decreasing the average cash balances available for earning interest 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the company believes that this significant revenue decrease was largely due to a continued adverse telecommunications industry wide economic conditions that have led to a reduction in purchases by the company s customers 
this has resulted in decreased shipments of the company s products to telecommunications service providers 
moreover  due to the nature of the company s products  which are proprietary in nature  price changes have not had a material effect on net sales 
however  the company s net sales and  therefore  net income may be adversely affected if price pressures arise 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results 
in the fiscal year ended march   sales to domestic customers decreased by to million  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
international sales decreased by to million  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
sales to domestic customers represented of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior fiscal year  reflecting an increase in international sales as a percentage of net sales 
the company believes that the increase in international sales relative to domestic sales in fiscal is the result of the more severe impact that the adverse economic climate has had on the telecommunications and data communications markets in the united states than in international markets 
gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test quality assurance and product yields  cost of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to approximately  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily the result of the company s inability to decrease manufacturing overhead costs at the same rate as the decrease in net sales that resulted from lower production volumes and shifts in the company s product mix 
similarly  the decrease in gross margins in fiscal year from fiscal year levels was the result of reduced shipment volumes without an equivalent decrease in manufacturing overhead costs  coupled with a shift in the company s product sales mix to lower margin video and imaging products 
the company anticipates that gross profit will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales because of anticipated future fluctuations in net sales  fluctuation in manufacturing costs and competitive pricing strategies  and changes in product mix and other factors 
research and development 
research and development r d costs consist primarily of the salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to design tools  supplies  services and facility expenses 
r d expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in r d spending was due to labor cost reductions in fiscal resulting from various cost control measures undertaken by the company 
however  had the various cost control measures not been in place  the r d expenses would have remained at the prior fiscal year s level or higher  reflecting the company s ongoing development efforts of new products 
in the future  the company expects that r d absolute dollar spending will increase as a result of growth and diversification of the markets that it serves  new product opportunities and the company s expansion into new markets and technologies 
the company expects research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales to continue to fluctuate due to the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist mainly of salaries and related expenses  sales commissions  professional and legal fees  and facilities expenses 
sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in sg a spending was primarily the result of cost control measures undertaken by the company coupled with reduced sales commissions as a result of the decrease in net sales for the fiscal year ended march  in the short term  many of the sg a expenses are fixed  causing a decline as a percentage of net sales in periods of rising sales and an increase as a percentage of net sales when sales growth is slower or declining 
however  it is possible that future sg a expenses will increase in absolute dollars as a result of possible future expansion of the company s infrastructure to support increased headcount  potential acquisition and integration activities  and general expansion of the company s operations 
the company will continue to assess its cost structure and other programs to improve operational efficiencies 
other income  net 
other income  net primarily consists of interest income  realized gains on marketable securities  and losses resulting from other investments 
for the fiscal year ended march   other income  net decreased to million  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
interest income  net for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease resulted from a decline in interest rates 
realized gains on investments were  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase resulted from greater sales of marketable securities in fiscal relative to fiscal declining interest rates allowed the company to realize investment gains at the time of sale of these securities  but reduced the company s interest income 
the company recorded losses of  on its investment in techfarm ventures q  lp resulting from losses incurred by the fund 
the company may report additional losses in connection with its investment in techfarm ventures q  lp or its investment in internet machines corporation which would negatively affect the company s future net income 
see investments in non public companies in the critical accounting policies section of this report

fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to a or million increase in sales of the company s communications products

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to approximately  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  was attributed to lower costs from increased production efficiencies associated with higher shipment levels and greater revenue contribution from new devices with higher gross margins that reached production 
furthermore  the company experienced a favorable shift in product mix toward higher margin products resulting from the growth in communications revenue  primarily from transmission product sales 
research and development 
r d expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended march  the absolute dollar increase in r d spending reflected the company s ongoing r d efforts related to transmission products

other income  net 
other income  net in the fiscal year ended march  increased by million or over the fiscal year ended march  the increase was mainly the result of higher cash balances available to earn interest 
for the fiscal year ended march   other income  net included a pre tax gain of million resulting from the sale of shares held in cypress semiconductor  inc the resulting increase in pre tax income gave rise to an increase of approximately million in employee compensation and related benefits due to higher employee incentive bonuses arising from the increased pre tax income

cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at march  from million at march  the primary reason for the decrease was investments in the equity of private companies and in marketable equity securities 
the company generated additional cash of million during fiscal year ended march  from operating activities 
adjustments to net income of million included million of non cash charges and changes in working capital 
during fiscal  the company s investing activities included the maturity and reinvestment of both short term and long term marketable securities  with purchases in excess of maturities of million 
capital purchases of million included purchases of manufacturing test equipment  computer equipment and software and hardware used for product development 
in july  exar invested million in the series c preferred stock round of financing for internet machines corporation  a pre revenue  privately held company developing a family of highly integrated communications ics that will provide protocol independent network processing and switch fabric solutions for high speed optical  metro area network and internet infrastructure equipment 
the company s investment represents of the equity interest in internet machines corporation 
as of march   the company held two investments in venture capital funds  skypoint telecom fund ii us  l 
p and techfarm ventures q  lp  totaling million and million  respectively 
as of march   the company was obligated to fund an additional million in skypoint telecom fund ii us  lp the company may need to use its existing cash and investments to fund this commitment 
effective may   the company reached an agreement with techfarm ventures management llc  to  among other matters  reduce the company s equity investment in the fund to million  or approximately of the fund s total committed capital 
as of june   the company had satisfied its capital contribution obligation 
if the company s assessment of the value of its investment is inconsistent with actual results  the company may be required to recognize impairment to the asset  resulting in additional expense on the company s consolidated income statements 
see investments in non public companies in the critical accounting policies section of this report 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company received million from the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plans and the purchase of common stock shares under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in march  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire outstanding common stock in the open market 
under this program  the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to million of exar s common stock 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company acquired  shares of its common stock for million 
the company did not acquire additional treasury shares during the fiscal year ended march  the company may utilize this program in the future  which would reduce cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities available to fund future operations and meet all other liquidity requirements 
the company places purchase orders with wafer foundries throughout its normal course of business 
as of march  the company had approximately  of outstanding purchase commitments with suppliers for the purchase of wafers 
the company expects to receive and pay for the wafers  within the next six months  from its existing cash balances 
the company anticipates that it will continue to finance its operations with cash flows from operations  existing cash and investment balances  and some combination of long term debt and or lease financing and additional sales of equity securities 
the combination and sources of capital will be determined by management based on the company s needs and prevailing market conditions 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  long term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements and capital equipment needs for at least the next months 
however  should the demand for the company s products decrease in the future  the availability of cash flows from operations may be limited  thus possibly having a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
from time to time  the company evaluates potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to its design expertise and market strategy  including investments in wafer fabrication foundries 
to the extent that the company pursues or positions itself to pursue these transactions  the company could choose to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 use of the pooling of interest method is prohibited for business combinations initiated after june  the company has adopted this statement  and since its adoptions  it has not had a material effect on the financial position or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas no 
are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established by sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
although sfas no 
supersedes fasb no 
 it retains some fundamental provisions of fasb no 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors the company is subject to a number of risks 
some of these risks are endemic to the fabless semiconductor industry and the same or similar to those disclosed in the company s previous sec filings  and some risks may arise in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing in the company 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of these risks 
as a result of these risks  the company s business  financial condition or operating results could be materially  adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of the company s common stock to decline  and stockholders may lose some or all of their investment 
the company is exposed to the risks associated with the continued slowdown and uncertainty in the us and global economy that may adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending continue to have a negative impact on the us and world economy 
many of the company s customers have experienced a slowdown in demand for their products as a result of continued uncertainty regarding future capital spending by the telecommunications service providers 
in turn  this uncertainty in capital spending derives from weak operating results of these service providers  which have hindered their ability to obtain additional capital from the public markets in order to continue to build their networks 
these service providers continue to face significant financial challenges and  therefore  may continue to delay or further reduce their spending on the company s customers products 
if the company s customers delay or cancel their orders of the company s products  company s revenues may be negatively impacted  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  such delays and cancellations by the company s customers may result in the company carrying inventory in excess of foreseeable market demand  which may result in the company incurring additional expenses for obsolete and excess inventory  thereby negatively impacting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the extent and severity of this economic downturn have made it difficult for the company to predict when and if demand for its products will increase 
the company does not know when or how quickly its customers will deplete their current inventories of the company s products and  therefore  the company cannot predict when these customers will need to replace their inventories with new products 
as a result  the company expects that revenues will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the current economic downturn continues  the company may need to add to its inventory reserves  which would negatively impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the industry wide reduction in capital spending and the resulting significant decrease in demand for the company s products experienced in fiscal resulted in increases of inventory 
however  if the current decrease in demand for the company s products continue  the company may incur additional expenses related to the write down of inventory 
the company s operating results may vary significantly because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  and such variations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company competes in the networking industry within the semiconductor space  both of which are cyclical markets subject to rapid technological change 
during the second half of the fiscal year ended march  through the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the networking and semiconductor industries experienced significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated decreases in prices and excess production capacity 
should the current economic downturn in the networking and semiconductor industries continue or worsen or even if these industries simply fail to recover fully from the downturn  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted  which could harm the company s stock price 
at the same time  these same industries are subject to unexpected  periodic and sharp increases in demand in a strong economic environment  potentially leading to production capacity constraints  which could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to ship products and meet customer demands in future periods 
the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s margins and operating results fluctuate significantly 
some of the factors that affect the company s quarterly and annual results  many of which are difficult or impossible to control or predict  are the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  shortened order to shipment time imposed by customers contrasted with long lead times to obtain inventories and materials needed by the company from its foundries and suppliers  fluctuations in the timing of customer s quantity requested for product shipments  fluctuations in the manufacturing output  yields and inventory levels of the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products that the company s customers purchase  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the announcement or introduction of products by the company s competitors  the availability of third party foundry assembly and test capacity and raw materials  erosion of average selling prices as a product matures coupled with the inability to sell more new products with higher average selling prices  resulting in lower margins  competitive pressures on selling prices  product availability or new technologies  the amount and timing of costs associated with product warranties and returns  the amount and timing of investments in research and development  market and or customer acceptance of the company s products  changes in customer concentration or requirements within certain market segments  changes in the company s customers end users concentration and or requirements  loss of one or more current customers or a disruption in the sales or distribution channels  costs associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations  the inability of the company s customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  general conditions in the economy  terrorist acts or acts or war and conditions in the communications and semiconductor industries  changes in capital spending by the telecommunications service providers  build up of customer and or channel inventory  and or fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s markets are subject to rapid technological change  therefore  the company s success depends on its ability to develop and introduce new products  if the company is not able to develop and introduce new products successfully  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  constantly changing customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased time in the design to production cycles  increased integration with other functions 
to develop new products for the company s target markets  the company must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand its technical and design expertise 
in addition  the company must continue to have its products designed into its customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
the company s ability to compete will depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  the company could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense redesigning its products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by its competitors 
in addition  the company may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
the company s pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets in which the company participates are intensely competitive  if the company is not able to compete successfully in these markets  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted 
the company s target markets are intensely competitive 
the company s ability to compete successfully in its target markets depends on the following factors designing new products that implement new technologies  subcontracting the manufacture of new products and delivering them in a timely manner  product quality and reliability  technical support and service  timely product introduction  product performance  product features  price  end user acceptance of the company s customers products  telecommunication industry spending  compliance with evolving standards  and or market acceptance of competitors products or technologies 
in addition  the company s competitors or customers may offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or end user or customer requirements  including products that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to its products 
the introduction of new products by the company s competitors or customers could render the company s existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
in addition  the company s competitors and customers may introduce products that integrate the functions performed by its ics on a single ic  thus eliminating the need for the company s products 
because the ic markets are highly fragmented  the company generally encounters different competitors in its various market areas 
competitors with respect to the company s communications products include conexant systems inc  pmc sierra  inc 
and transwitch corporation 
in addition  the expansion of the company s communications product portfolio may in the future bring it into competition with other established communications ic companies  such as applied micro circuits corporation 
and vitesse semiconductor corporation 
competitors in the company s other markets include analog devices inc  philips electronics and texas instruments  inc 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical and management resources than the company 
some of these competitors may be able to sell their products at prices below which it would be profitable for the company to sell its products 
if the company is unable to generate additional revenue from the communications ics market  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in recent quarters has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from sales of communications ics 
historically  the company has generated a majority of its revenue from video  imaging and other such non communications ic markets 
however  the markets for these products are increasingly subject to extreme price competition  and the company does not believe that it will be able to reduce its costs of designing and manufacturing these non communications ics sufficiently to compete with these declining average selling prices 
and even if the company were able to reduce its non communications ic costs sufficiently to maintain its competitive position  the customers in these markets may not purchase these products 
moreover  these markets may decrease in size in the future 
therefore  the company expects to decrease its funding of development efforts related to its video and imaging and other non communications products  and as a result  revenues from these products will decline in future periods 
therefore  the company is continuing to focus its research and sales resources on the communications ic market 
given the company s increasing dependence on the communications ic market to support its revenue growth  the company must continue to generate additional sales from this market  either by taking market share from competitors or by maintaining market share but growing absolute sales based on a steadily increasing communications ic market 
given the company s decreasing reliance on the non communications ic market for sales  if the company is not able to generate additional revenue in the communications ic market  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering and management personnel and its ability to identify  hire and retain quality personnel  if it were to lose key employees or fail to identify  hire and retain such individuals  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company s future success depends  in part  on the continued service of its key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and its ability to identify  hire and retain quality personnel 
in the future  the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the intense competition for highly qualified personnel  particularly in silicon valley  has subsided somewhat  in part due to the current economic slowdown 
however  competition for skilled employees continues to be a considerable risk inherent in the markets in which the company competes 
likewise  with respect to the company s management  the company s anticipated future growth is expected to continue to place more demands on management resources and will  therefore  likely require the addition of new management personnel as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit key design engineers  technical  sales  marketing and management personnel could harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on third party foundries to manufacture its ics  any disruption in or loss of the company s foundries capacity to manufacture its products could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
most of its products are based on cmos processes 
although two foundries manufacture its products based on cmos processes  most are manufactured at a single foundry 
the company primarily uses a single foundry to manufacture most of its bipolar products 
this foundry has discontinued its domestic wafer foundry 
however  the company has taken steps to ensure that its current and future demand for fabrication capacity is met through a consignment inventory arrangement with the foundry 
the company does not have long term wafer supply agreements with its cmos foundries that guarantee wafer or product quantities  prices  and delivery or lead times 
rather  the cmos foundries manufacture the company s products on a purchase order basis 
the company provides these foundries with rolling forecasts of its production requirements 
however  the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to the company is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
in addition  the company cannot be certain that it will continue to do business with its foundries on terms as favorable as its current terms 
other significant risks associated with the company s reliance on third party foundries include the lack of control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and or potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property 
the company could experience a substantial delay or interruption in the shipment of its products or an increase in its costs due to the following a sudden  sharp increase in demand for semiconductor devices throughout the semiconductor market  which could strain foundries manufacturing resources and cause delays in manufacturing and shipment of the company s products  acts of terrorism  a manufacturing disruption experienced by one or more of the company s foundries or sudden reduction or elimination of any existing source or sources of semiconductor devices  extended time required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products  and or failure of the company s suppliers to obtain the raw materials and equipment used in the production of its ics 
if the company s foundries discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet its demands or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture its products  the company may face production delays  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s wafer and product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture its products 
as a result  the company is subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production of older or lower volume material of specific processes that it uses to produce parts supplied to the company 
the company s bipolar wafer foundry has discontinued its domestic wafer foundry 
however  the company has taken steps to ensure that its current and future demand is met through a consignment inventory arrangement with the foundry 
additionally  the company cannot be certain that its foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of its products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of the company s products are based 
each of these events could increase the company s costs and harm its ability to deliver its products on time  thereby materially and adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test its products subjects it to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs  these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of its products 
the company s reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks the company s reduced control over manufacturing yields  delivery schedules and product quality relative to in house testing and assembly  acts of terrorism  which could disrupt the company s supply  difficulties in selecting  qualifying and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties from the subcontractors for products assembled and tested for the company  maintaining an adequate supply of assembly or test services  potential increases in assembly and test prices  and or potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property by the company s subcontractors 
these risks may lead to delays in the delivery of the company s product or increased costs in the finished products  either of which could harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to secure foundry capacity  the company may be required to enter into financial and other arrangements with foundries  which could result in the dilution of its earnings or otherwise harm its operating results 
allocation of a foundry s manufacturing capacity may be influenced by a customer s size or the existence of a long term agreement with the foundry 
to address foundry capacity constraints  the company and other semiconductor companies that rely on third party foundries have utilized various arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit a company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
while the company is not currently a party to any of these arrangements  it may decide to enter into these arrangements in the future 
the company cannot be sure  however  that these arrangements will be available to it on acceptable terms  if at all 
any of these arrangements could require the company to commit substantial capital and  accordingly  could require it to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
this could result in the dilution of its earnings or the ownership of its stockholders or otherwise harm its operating results 
the company s reliance on foreign suppliers exposes it to risks associated with international operations  any of which could materially and adversely impact its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company uses semiconductor wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors throughout asia for most of its products 
the company s dependence on these subcontractors involves the following substantial risks political  civil and economic instability  disruption to air transportation to from asia  embargo affecting the availability of raw materials  equipment or services  changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates  and or compliance with local or foreign regulatory requirements 
these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which would harm the company s profitability and customer relationships  thereby materially and adversely impacting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s reliance on foreign customers could cause fluctuations in its operating results  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international sales accounted for of net sales for fiscal year international sales will likely continue to account for an increasing portion of the company s revenues  which would subject the company to the following risks changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political  civil and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products  limited intellectual property protection  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the burden of complying with and the risk of violating a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and or potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  because sales of the company s products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the relative price of the company s products so that they become more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
furthermore  because some of the company s customers purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  the company may be limited in its ability to enforce its rights under these agreements and to collect damages  if awarded 
the company relies on its distributors and sales representatives to sell many of its products  if these distributors or representatives stop selling the company s products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
the company sells many of its products through two non exclusive domestic distributors and sales representatives 
the company s distributors and sales representatives could reduce or discontinue sales of its products 
they may not devote the resources necessary to sell the company s products in the volumes and within the time frames that it expects 
in addition  the company depends on the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives  some of which are small organizations with limited working capital 
in turn  these distributors and sales representatives depend substantially on general economic conditions and conditions within the semiconductor industry 
the company believes that its success will continue to depend on these distributors and sales representatives 
if some or all of the company s distributors and sales representatives experience financial difficulties  or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote and sell its products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
because the company s communications ics typically have lengthy sales cycles  the company may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of sales revenue 
due to the communications ic product cycle  it usually takes the company more than twelve months to realize volume shipments after it first contacts a customer 
the company first works with customers to achieve a design win  which may take nine months or longer 
the company s customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between the company s research and development efforts and its realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of the company s communications products by its customers 
if the company is not able to convert a significant portion of its design wins into actual revenue  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company has secured a significant number of design wins for new and existing products 
such design wins are viewed as a metric for future revenues 
however  many of the company s design wins may never generate revenues as the company s customers own projects and product offerings are cancelled or do not generate sufficient demand in their end markets 
additionally  many of the company s design wins are from privately held  early stage companies  thus increasing the risk that certain of the company s design wins will not translate into future revenue because such early stage customers may no longer exist by the time the company s products are ready to ship 
if design wins do generate revenue  the time lag between the design win and meaningful revenue is in excess of months 
if the company fails to convert a significant portion of its design wins into actual sales with recognizable revenue  the company s revenue will be lower than its forecasts  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s backlog may not result in future revenue 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and quantities actually purchased  cancellations of orders  distributor returns or price reductions  the company s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of the order backlog during any particular period  or the failure of the company s backlog to result in future revenue  could harm the company s business 
fixed operating expenses relative to revenue and a company practice of ordering materials in anticipation of future customer demand may make it difficult for the company to respond appropriately to sudden swings in revenue  such sudden swings in revenue may therefore have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and  therefore  it has limited ability to reduce expenses quickly and sufficiently in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  the company s operating results will be harmed if its revenues do not meet its revenue projections 
the company may experience revenue shortfalls for the following reasons a significant reduction in customer demand  significant pricing pressures that occur because of declines in average selling prices over the life of a product  sudden shortages of raw materials  wafer fabrication  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead the company s suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers  in turn  hinder the company s ability to meet its sales obligations  and or the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 
in addition  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from the company s outside suppliers and foundries  the company may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
therefore  such revenue shortfalls could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past and may in the future make acquisitions and significant strategic equity investments  which may involve a number of risks  if the company is unable to address these risks successfully such acquisitions and investments could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has undertaken a number of strategic acquisitions and investments in the past and may do so from time to time in the future 
the risks involved with acquisitions include  among others diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key personnel  amortization of acquired intangible assets  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company  the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations  and or assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
the risks involved with key strategic equity investments include  among others diversion of management s attention  possible litigation resulting from these types of investments  the possibility that the company may not receive a favorable return on its investments  the original investment may become impaired  which could negatively harm the results of operations  and or incur losses from these investments  and or the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
any such delays or other such operations of financial problems could adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights adequately 
the company s ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  mask work registrations  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and non disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
despite these efforts  the company cannot be certain that the steps it takes to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the company s technology  or that its competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to the company s technology 
more specifically  the company cannot be sure that its pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
nor can the company be sure that  if challenged  the company s patents will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate the company s products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to it 
the company could be required to pay substantial damages or could be subject to other equitable remedies if it were proven that it infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
if a third party were successful in proving that the company s technology infringes some party s proprietary rights  the company could be required to pay substantial damages 
if it were proven that the company willfully infringed on a third party s proprietary rights  the company could be held liable for treble damages 
the company could also be subject to equitable remedies  including injunctions limiting or prohibiting the sale of its products 
if the company were required to pay damages or otherwise became subject to such equitable remedies  its business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
similarly  if the company were required to pay license fees to third parties based on a successful infringement claim brought against it  such fees could exceed the company s revenue 
the company could be required to pay substantial damages and could be restricted or prohibited from selling its products if it were proven that it violated the intellectual property rights of others 
if a third party were to prove that the company s technology infringed a third party s intellectual property rights  the company could be required to pay substantial damages for past infringement and could be required to pay license fees or royalties on future sales of the company s products 
if the company were required to pay such license fees whenever it sold its products  such fees could exceed the company s revenue 
in addition  if it were proven that the company willfully infringed on a third party s proprietary rights  the company could be held liable for three times the amount of the damages that the company would otherwise have to pay 
such intellectual property litigation could also require the company to stop selling  incorporating or using its products that use the infringed intellectual property  obtain a license to make  sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  it at all  and redesign the company s products so as not to use the fringed intellectual property  which may not be technically or commercially feasible 
furthermore  the defense of infringement claims and lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be expensive to resolve and could require a significant portion of management s time 
in addition  rather than litigating an infringement matter  the company may determine that it is in the company s best interest to settle the matter 
terms of a settlement may include the payment of damages and the company s agreement to license technology in exchange for a license fee and ongoing royalties 
these fees could be substantial 
if the company were forced to take any of the actions described above or defend against any claims from third parties  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
earthquakes and other natural disasters may damage the company s facilities or those of its suppliers 
the company s corporate headquarters in fremont  california are located near major earthquake faults that have experienced seismic activity 
in addition  some of the company s suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near its headquarters  the company s operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of the company s major suppliers could disrupt the operations of those suppliers  which could limit the supply of the company s products and harm its business 
the company relies on continuous power supply to conduct its operations 
the company relies on a continuous power supply to conduct its business from its headquarters located in california 
in the past  california has experienced energy shortages  which resulted in rolling blackouts throughout the state 
additional rolling blackouts may occur in the future and could disrupt the company s operations  research and development and other critical functions 
such disruption in power supply may temporarily suspend operations in its headquarters 
this disruption could impede the company s ability to continue operations  which could delay the introduction of new products  hinder the company s sales efforts  impede the company s ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  which could have a negative impact on the company and its results of operations 
however  the company s risk is minimized through the co generator system project  whereby the company will produce all of its power needs 
see liquidity and capital sources for an in depth discussion on this topic 
the company s stock price is volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated significantly to date 
in the future  the market price of its common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to the company s anticipated or actual operating results  announcements or introductions of new products  technological innovations by the company or its competitors  product delays or setbacks by the company  its customers or its competitors  customer concentration  conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets  the commencement of litigation  changes in estimates of the company s performance by securities analysts  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  and or general economic and market conditions 
in the past  securities and class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities 
the company may have been or may be the target of one or more of these class actions suits which could result in significant costs and divert management s attention  thereby harming the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  including semiconductor companies  and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these fluctuations may harm the market price of the company s common stock 
the anti takeover provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by its stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  as the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit the company s consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of its assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on the company s stockholders 
the company s stockholders must give days advance notice prior to the relevant meeting to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to the company s stockholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
the company has in place a stockholder rights plan or poison pill that may result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer of the company in the event that the company s board of directors does not agree to an acquisition proposal 
the rights plan may make it more difficult and costly to acquire the company 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of the company s common stock 
the delaware statute makes it more difficult for the company to be acquired without the consent of its board of directors and management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily through its foreign operations 
this exposure is the result of foreign operating expenses being denominated in foreign currency 
operational currency requirements are typically forecasted for a three month period 
if there is a need to hedge this risk  the company will enter into transactions to purchase currency in the open market or enter into forward currency exchange contracts which are currently available under its bank lines of credit 
while it is expected that this method of hedging foreign currency risk will be utilized in the future  the hedging methodology and or usage may be changed to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
if the company s foreign operations forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
for the fiscal year ended march   the company did not have significant foreign currency denominated net assets or net liabilities positions  and had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturity dates with various banks and investment banking institutions 
the market value of these investments on any given day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
this exposure is not hedged because a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on investment income 
the actual impact on investment income in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
both short term and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
at march   short term investments consisted of auction rate securities  government and corporate securities of million and long term investments consisted of government and corporate securities of million 
at march   the difference between the fair market value and the underlying cost of such investments was only  the company s net income is dependent  amongst other factors  interest income and realized gains from the sale of marketable investments 
if interest rates continue to decline or the company is not able to realize gains from the sale of marketable securities  the company s net income may be negatively impacted
