results of operations general the company s net income of  for fiscal year increased  from a net loss of  for fiscal year the net income in the most recent year was favorably impacted by the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance of  related to net operating loss nol carryforwards 
the company did not recognize a tax benefit for its losses in fiscal year a revenue increase of  or  from revenues realized during fiscal year led to the significant improvement  reflecting the successful third quarter launch of three products that benefited from marketing exclusivity in fiscal year  fluoxetine prozac r mg and mg tablets  fluoxetine mg capsules  and megestrol acetate oral suspension megace r oral suspension 
net sales reached a historical high of  for fiscal year compared to net sales of  for the same period last year 
following the sales growth  the gross margins increased to  or of net sales  in  from  or of net sales  in the same period of the prior year 
the improved results included increased investment in research and development  which totaled  for the twelve months of  an increase of  from the comparable period of selling  general and administrative costs for the most recent period of  increased  from the corresponding period of the prior year  primarily due to additional marketing programs  shipping costs and legal fees associated with new product launches 
in fiscal year  the company s financial results improved compared to fiscal year higher sales and gross margins more than offset additional legal costs related to several patent infringement actions and increased research and development spending 
gross margins in fiscal year improved to of net sales compared to in fiscal year  as higher margin contributions from new products more than offset lower contributions from older or discontinued products 
the improved margins further reduced operating losses in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year the company incurred net losses of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the net results in fiscal year included additional interest expense from higher levels of short term debt 
in addition to its own product development program  the company has several strategic alliances through which it co develops and distributes products 
as a result of its internal program and strategic alliances  the company s pipeline of potential products includes andas five of which have been tentatively approved  pending with  and awaiting approval from  the fda 
the company pays a percentage of the gross profits to its strategic partners on sales of products covered by its distribution agreements see notes to consolidated financial statements distribution and supply agreements 
in july and august  the fda granted approvals for three anda submissions  one each by par  reddy and alphapharm  for megestrol acetate oral suspension  fluoxetine mg capsules and fluoxetine mg and mg tablets  respectively  which as first to file opportunities entitled the company days of marketing exclusivity for the products 
the company began marketing megestrol acetate oral suspension  which is not subject to any profit sharing agreements  in july in august  the company began marketing fluoxetine mg capsules covered under the reddy development and supply agreement and fluoxetine and mg tablets covered under the genpharm additional product agreement 
generic competitors of the company received days marketing exclusivity for fluoxetine mg and mg capsules 
additional generic competitors  with comparable products to all three strengths of the company s fluoxetine  began entering the market in the first quarter of although the company has recently learned of another generic approval in the first quarter of  to date the company had not experienced generic competition on its megestrol acetate oral suspension see notes to consolidated financial statements distribution and supply agreements 
critical to sustaining the improvement in the company s financial condition is the introduction of new manufactured and distributed products at selling prices that generate significant gross margin 
the company  through its internal development program and strategic alliances  is committed to developing new products that have limited competition and longer product life cycles 
in addition to new product introductions expected as part of its various strategic alliances  the company plans to continue to invest in research and development efforts while seeking additional products for sale through new and existing distribution agreements  additional first to file opportunities  vertical integration with raw material suppliers and unique dosage forms and strengths to differentiate its products in the marketplace 
the company is engaged in efforts  subject to fda approval and other factors  to introduce new products as a result of its research and development efforts and distribution and development agreements with third parties 
no assurance can be given that the company will obtain or develop any additional products for sale 
the generic drug industry in the united states continues to be highly competitive 
the factors contributing to the intense competition and affecting both the introduction of new products and the pricing and profit margins of the company  include  among other things i introduction of other generic drug manufacturer s products in direct competition with the company s significant products  ii consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  iii ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent expiration or exclusivity periods  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits  iv willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among pharmaceutical manufacturers and v pricing and product deletions by competitors see business marketing and customers and competition 
net sales net sales for fiscal year of  increased  or  from net sales of  for the corresponding period of the sales increase was primarily due to the third quarter of launch of fluoxetine mg and mg tablets sold under a distribution agreement with genpharm  fluoxetine mg capsules sold under a distribution agreement with reddy  and megestrol acetate oral suspension manufactured by the company 
net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately and  respectively  of the company s net sales in fiscal years and the company is substantially dependent upon distributed products for its sales  and as the company introduces new products under its distribution agreements  it is expected this trend will continue 
any inability by suppliers to meet expected demand could adversely affect future sales 
at december   the company was within the marketing exclusivity period with respect to two drugs  megestrol acetate oral suspension and fluoxetine 
with respect to megestrol acetate oral suspension  the company s day exclusivity period ended in mid january and the company has recently learned that another generic competitor was granted fda approval to market the product 
the company has patents that cover its unique formulation for megestrol acetate oral suspension and will avail itself of all legal remedies and will take all of the necessary steps to protect its intellectual property rights 
although a competitor may be entering the market at some point  the company believes that generic competitors are less likely to enter the market because doing so would likely infringe on either bms s or the company s formulation patent 
megestrol acetate oral suspension is still anticipated to be a significant profit contributor during fiscal year  while it appears there may be limited competition 
in fiscal year  the company did not record a price protection reserve for megestrol acetate oral suspension 
the company will continue evaluating the possibility of competition for the product and will record a price protection reserve when it deems necessary 
with respect to fluoxetine  for which the exclusivity period ended in late january  at december  the company had established a price protection reserve of approximately  based on its estimate that at the end of its exclusivity period between eight and ten additional generic manufacturers would introduce and market comparable products for the mg and mg tablets and between one and three additional manufacturers would introduce and market a comparable product for the mg capsules 
net sales of fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension for fiscal year were approximately  and  respectively 
the impact of the pricing competition will have an adverse affect on sales and gross margins on fluoxetine in future periods 
net sales of  in fiscal year increased  or  from fiscal year additional sales from new products  primarily products sold under distribution agreements with genpharm  offset the termination of the prescription transdermal nicotine patch distribution rights  effective may   and reduced sales of antibiotics  which decreased due to an inability by suppliers to meet the company s production requirements 
the company discontinued its antibiotic product line in fiscal year due to continued production issues with suppliers 
total sales of antibiotics were approximately  or of the company s total net sales in fiscal year net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately of the company s net sales in both fiscal years and sales of the company s products are principally dependent upon  among other things  i pricing levels and competition  ii market penetration for the existing product line  iii the continuation of existing distribution agreements  iv introduction of new distributed products  v approval of andas and introduction of new manufactured products  including potential exclusivity periods  and vi the level of customer service 
although there can be no assurance  the company anticipates introducing new products in fiscal year and increasing sales of certain existing products to offset the loss of sales from competition on any of its significant products 
the company will continue to implement measures to reduce the overall impact of its top products  including adding additional products through new and existing distribution agreements  manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions see business competition 
gross margins the gross margin of  of net sales for fiscal year increased  from  of net sales in the corresponding period of the prior year 
the gross margin improvement was achieved through additional contributions from sales of higher margin new products  and to a lesser extent  increased sales of certain existing products and more favorable manufacturing overhead variances 
for fiscal year  fluoxetine  which is subject to profit sharing agreements with genpharm and reddy  contributed approximately  to the margin improvement while megestrol acetate oral suspension contributed approximately  as a result of the day marketing exclusivity granted to the company for fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension  pricing for these products is such that they yield relatively high gross margins  before applicable profit splits  but after the reduction of sales for the fluoxetine price protection reserve discussed above during the exclusivity period 
the days marketing exclusivity extended into late january for fluoxetine and until mid january for megestrol acetate oral suspension 
as discussed above  additional generic manufacturers have introduced and began marketing comparable fluoxetine products at the end of the company s exclusivity period adversely affecting the company s sales volumes  selling prices and gross margins for the product 
as a result  the company s gross margin from fluoxetine is expected to substantially decline in future periods 
the company s gross margin for megestrol acetate oral suspension could also decline if additional manufacturers introduce and market a comparable generic product 
the gross margin in fiscal year increased  to  of net sales from  of net sales in the prior year 
gross margin improvements were attained principally through the sale of new products and lower manufacturing costs  primarily due to the leasing of the congers facility in march the loss of gross margin from the termination of the prescription transdermal nicotine patch distribution rights was partially offset by the sale of distribution rights for a non prescription transdermal nicotine 
inventory write offs amounted to  for fiscal year compared to  in the corresponding period of the prior year 
the inventory write offs  taken in the normal course of business  are primarily related to work in process inventory not meeting the company s quality control standards and the disposal of finished products due to short shelf lives 
the higher inventory write offs in the most recent year include the disposal of validation batches related to manufacturing process improvements 
inventory write offs of  in fiscal year increased from  in the prior year 
the higher inventory write offs in were primarily attributable to a delayed product launch caused by a brand name company obtaining an additional patent for a product and the discontinuance of additional low margin products 
in fiscal year  the company s top four selling products accounted for approximately of net sales compared to and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal years and three of the products in the most recent year  fluoxetine  megestrol oral suspension and ranitidine  were not part of the top four in any of the preceding periods and accounted for approximately  and  respectively of the company s total net sales 
the aggregate sales and gross margin generated by fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension accounted for a significant portion of the company s overall sales and gross margin improvements in fiscal year and any reductions in pricing for these products will reduce future contributions of these products to the company s overall financial performance 
although there can be no assurance  the company anticipates introducing new products in fiscal year and increasing sales of certain existing products to offset the loss of sales and gross margin from competition on any of its significant products 
the company will continue to implement measures to reduce the overall impact of the top four products  including adding additional products through new and existing distribution agreements  manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions 
operating expenses research and development in fiscal year  the company incurred research and development expenses of  compared to  for the corresponding period of the prior year 
the increased costs were primarily attributable to payments to elan related to the development of a clonidine transdermal patch and higher costs for raw material  biostudies  including those related to products co developed with genpharm  personnel and additional payments for formulation development work performed for pri by unaffiliated companies 
the company s domestic research and development program is integrated with ipr  its research operation in israel

annual research and development costs in fiscal year are expected to exceed the total for fiscal year by approximately 
in fiscal year  research and development expenses of  increased  or  from  in fiscal year the higher expenditures  primarily attributable to increased bio study activity  personnel and material costs  were partially offset by lower payments to purchase rights to pharmaceutical processes and for formulation development work performed for pri by unaffiliated companies

selling  general and administrative although selling  general and administrative costs of  for fiscal year increased  or  over the same period last year  the cost as a percentage of net sales in the respective periods decreased to in from in the higher dollar amount in the current year was primarily attributable to additional marketing programs  shipping costs and legal fees associated with new product introductions  and to a lesser extent  increased personnel costs 
the company anticipates it will continue to incur a high level of legal expenses related to the costs of litigation connected with certain potential new product introductions see notes to consolidated financial statements commitments  contingencies and other matters legal proceedings 
selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal year of  of net sales increased  or  from fiscal year costs of  of net sales

in addition  fiscal year included higher personnel and accounts receivable collection costs

critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition and the related determination of accounts receivable and related allowances  research and development expense and patent litigation cost  deferred charges and other assets  intangible assets  depreciable and amortizable lives  pension benefits and legal proceedings 
in applying such policies management must use some amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
the company is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time its products are shipped to its customers as  at that time  the risk of loss or physical damage to the product passes to the customer  and the obligations of customers to pay for the products are not dependent on the resale of the product or the company s assistance in such resale 
the company may offer price protection  or shelf stock adjustments  with respect to sales of new generic drugs for which it has a market exclusivity period 
to account for the fact that the price of such drugs may decline when additional generic manufacturers introduce and market a comparable generic product at the end of the exclusivity period  such plans  which are common in the industry  generally provide the company will credit its customers for the difference between the company s new price at the end of the exclusivity period and the price at which the company sold the customers the product with respect to the quantity remaining on the customer s shelf at the end of the exclusivity period 
the company records charges reductions of revenue to accrue this amount for specific product sales that will be subject to price protection based on the company s estimate of customer inventory levels and market prices at the end of the exclusivity period 
customers are permitted to return unused product  after approval from the company  up to days before and one year after the expiration date for the product s lot 
additionally  certain customers are eligible for price rebates  offered as an incentive to increase sales volume  on the basis of the volume of purchases of a product over a specified period which generally ranges from one to three months  and certain customers are credited with chargebacks on the basis of their resales to end use customers  such as hmo s  which have contracted with the company for quantity discounts 
in each instance the company has the historical experience and access to other information  including the total demand for each drug the company manufactures  the company s market share  the recent or pending introduction of new drugs  the inventory practices of the company s customers and the resales by its customers to end users having contracts with the company  necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such returns or allowances  and records reserves for such returns or allowances at the time of sale 
accounts receivable and related allowances the accounts receivable amounts are net of provisions for customer rebates and chargebacks 
customer rebates are price reductions generally given to customers as an incentive to increase sales volume 
this incentive is based on a customer s volume of purchases during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
chargebacks are price adjustments given to the wholesale customer for product it resells to specific healthcare providers on the basis of prices negotiated between the company and the provider 
where the provider has negotiated with the company for a price below the normal resale price  the company adjusts its price to the wholesaler supplying that provider accordingly 
the adjustment is based on the wholesaler s actual resales to that provider 
the company accepts returns of product according to the following i the returns must be approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompany any request  ii the company generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will give such customer a credit for such return provided such product is returned within six months prior to  and until months following  such product s expiration date  iii any product that has more than six months until its expiration date may be returned to the company  however  no credit will be issued to the customer iv the company will not accept returns of products if such products cannot be resold  unless the reason that such products cannot be resold is that the expiration date has passed 
in addition  private label stock is not returnable 
the accounts receivable allowances include price adjustments that consist of cash discounts  sales promotions and price protection or shelf stock adjustments 
the total price protection the company will credit customers at the end of an exclusivity period will depend on the amount by which the price declines as the result of the introduction of comparable generic products by additional manufacturers  and the shelf stock customers will have at the end of the exclusivity period 
in the company s experience the amount by which the price of a drug may decline at the end of an exclusivity period will depend in part on the number of additional generic manufacturers that introduce and market a comparable product 
the company estimates the amount by which prices will decline based on its monitoring of the number and status of fda applications and tentative approvals and its historical experience with other drugs for which the company had market exclusivity 
the company estimates the amount of shelf stock that will remain at the end of an exclusivity period based on both its knowledge of the inventory practices for wholesalers and retail distributors and conversations it has with its major customers 
using these factors  the company estimates the total price protection credit it will have to issue at the end of an exclusivity period and records charges reductions of sales to accrue this amount for specific product sales that will be subject to price protection based on the company s estimate of customer inventory levels and market prices at the end of the exclusivity period 
as a result  the company will be required to credit customers for price protection based on the quantity of that inventory and the decrease in a particular products market price at the end of the exclusivity period 
research and development expense and patent litigation cost amounts related to contractual rights acquired by the company to products which have not been approved by the fda and where the company does not have the right to an alternative future use for the product  are charged to expense as research and development 
similarly  company funding of the research and development efforts of others are charged to research and development expense 
research and development costs the company incurrs to develop new products and obtain premarketing regulatory approval for such products are expensed as incurred 
deferred charges and other assets contractual rights acquired by the company to a process  product or other legal right that has multiple or alternative future uses which support its realizabilty  are capitalized and the cost is amortized over the period in which the related cash flows are generated 
all costs that are capitalized are subject to periodic impairment testing 
intangible assets distribution rights acquired by the company are capitalized and amortized over the contractual period 
depreciable and amortizable lives property  plant and equipment are depreciated straight line over their estimated useful lives that range from three to forty years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease 
pension benefits the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on its selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in the commitments  contingencies and other matters footnote to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect pension obligations and future expense 
legal proceedings as discussed in the commitments  contingencies and other matters footnote to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to several patent infringement matters whose outcome could have a material impact on future profitability  cash flows and financial condition 
the company is also currently involved in other litigation matters  including certain patent actions  product liability and actions by former employees and believes these actions are incidental to the business and that the ultimate resolution thereof will not have a material adverse effect on future profitability  cash flow or financial condition 
the company intends to vigorously defend these actions 
subsequent events on march   the company announced the termination of negotiations with isp concerning the previously announced proposed purchase of the isp finetech fine chemical business 
isp finetech  based in haifa  israel and columbus  ohio  specializes in the design and manufacture of proprietary synthetic chemical processes used in the production of complex and valuable organic compounds for the pharmaceutical industry 
the company discontinued negotiations with isp as a result of various events and circumstances that have occurred since the announcement of the proposed transaction
