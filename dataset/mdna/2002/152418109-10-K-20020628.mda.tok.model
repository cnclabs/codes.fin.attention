item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the operations of the bank are generally influenced by overall economic conditions  the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of financial institution regulatory authorities  including the banking commissioner  the federal reserve board and the fdic 
the bank monitors its exposure to earnings fluctuations resulting from market interest rate changes 
historically the bank s earnings have been vulnerable to changing interest rates due to differences in the terms to maturity or repricing of its assets and liabilities 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank s net interest income and net income could be negatively affected as interest sensitive liabilities deposits and borrowings could adjust more quickly to rising interest rates than the bank s interest sensitive assets loans and investments 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the bank s results of operations for the last three fiscal years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal years and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the bank s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the allowance for loan losses policy is a critical accounting policy that required the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and management s estimation of future losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
refer to the discussion of allowance for loan losses in the business section and notes and to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of management s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
results of operations the bank reported net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal  as compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal and million or per diluted share after the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for fiscal the bank s earnings decrease for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to write downs of thousand in certain equity securities which had experienced a decline in fair value judged to be other than temporary  partially offset by higher net interest income 
the bank s earnings decrease for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in the net gain on sale of investment securities  partially offset by higher net interest income 
the increase in salaries and benefits in was impacted by a one time expenditure relating to the settlement of a severance claim 
the bank was able to increase net interest and dividend income during the period despite a fiercely competitive market for loans 
the increase in the cost of deposits in fiscal resulted from management s decision to aggressively price deposits which caused the overall cost of funds to increase 
interest rate spread 
the bank s operating results are significantly affected by its net interest spread  which is the difference between the yield on loans and investments and the interest cost of deposits and borrowings 
the interest spread is affected by economic conditions and market factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows

the bank experienced a million overall decrease in interest and dividend income for the year ended march  compared to fiscal interest income on loans decreased by million to million due to a million decrease in average loan balances and a basis point decline in the average rate earned 
during fiscal year  the bank originated and purchased new loans amounting to million  including million during the fourth quarter of the year 
with declining interest rates  management had decided to slow down the origination of fixed rate residential loans during the first half of the year 
during the second half of the year  the bank priced its residential loans more competitively which increased origination volume 
the bank has continued to emphasize commercial lending in order to diversify the loan portfolio and improve overall portfolio yield 
additionally  interest and dividend income on investments increased by thousand in fiscal due primarily to an million increase in average total balances of investments partially offset by a basis point decrease in the rate earned on investments 
the overall total average balance of interest earning assets increased by million from fiscal to fiscal  and the average yield on all interest earning assets decreased by basis points between the two fiscal years 
the bank experienced a million overall increase in interest and dividend income for the year ended march  compared to fiscal interest income on loans increased by million to million due to a million increase in average loan balances 
total loans increased by million from march  to march  and the yield on these loans increased by basis points 
the bank originated new loans amounting to million 
the increase in the loan portfolio reflects a management decision to increase loan originations in a favorable interest rate environment 
as rates declined during the calendar year  management decided to slow down residential lending but continued its emphasis on commercial lending in order to diversify the loan portfolio and improve overall portfolio yield 
additionally  interest and dividend income on investments increased by thousand due primarily to an million increase in average total balances of investments and a basis point increase in the rate earned on investments during fiscal the overall total average balance of interest earning assets increased by million from fiscal to fiscal  and the average yield on all interest earning assets increased by basis points between the two fiscal years 
interest expense 
for fiscal  interest expense on deposits decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease can be attributed primarily to a basis point reduction in the cost of deposits in fiscal reflecting the series of reductions in interest rates initiated by the federal reserve board beginning in january and the repricing of nearly of certificates of deposit outstanding at march  in fiscal interest expense on borrowings decreased thousand as the average balance of borrowings rose to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  which was more than offset by a decrease of basis points in the rate paid on these borrowings to in fiscal from in fiscal there was an overall increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million during fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  interest expense on deposits increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase can be attributed primarily to an increase of basis points in the interest rate paid on deposits from during fiscal to in fiscal  plus an increase in the average total balance of interest bearing deposits to million during fiscal from million in the prior period 
interest expense on borrowings also increased as the average balance of borrowings rose to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  in addition to an increase of basis points in the rate paid on these borrowings to in fiscal from in fiscal both factors combined to cause a million increase in interest expense on borrowings during fiscal there was an overall increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million during fiscal compared to fiscal provision for loan losses 
due to the high level of asset quality  as measured by low delinquency rates and the absence of non performing assets during the past two years  the bank made no provision for loan losses during fiscal  and at march   and  non performing assets totaled   and thousand  representing  and of total assets  respectively 
non interest income 
total non interest income for fiscal was thousand  compared to million during fiscal the primary reason for the thousand decline in fiscal was the write down of thousand in certain equity securities which had experienced a decline in fair value judged to be other than temporary and a decrease in gains on the sale of securities 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in deposit service charges attributable to an increase in core deposit accounts and  for the first time  brokerage income from the bank s new offering of investment products through a third party 
total non interest income for fiscal was million  compared to million during fiscal the primary reason for the thousand decline was a decrease in gains from the sale of investment securities from million in fiscal to thousand in fiscal non interest expenses 
non interest expenses increased thousand during fiscal  as compared to the year ended march  such increase is primarily due to increases in professional fees of thousand and data processing service fees of thousand  partially offset by decreases in other expenses of thousand and occupancy and equipment expenses of thousand 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expenses  increased by thousand  or  during fiscal the increase in professional fees of thousand in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased legal and consulting costs 
the increase in data processing service fees was due to the change  in november  to a new data processing system more suitable to the bank s needs 
the decrease in other expenses of thousand was due to a reduction in advertising expense of thousand as the bank curtailed its regular promotion of certificates of deposits 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased approximately thousand during fiscal despite a thousand increase in esop expense due to the initial application of the fair value method of accounting for the allocation of esop shares to employees 
prior to fiscal  compensation expense was recognized as shares were allocated to esop participants accounts based on the cost of such shares to the esop 
in future periods  compensation expense relating to the esop may be significantly affected by the market value of the company s common stock 
non interest expenses increased thousand during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  this increase is primarily attributable to increase in salaries and benefits of thousand  which included a one time expenditure relating to the settlement of a severance claim  an increase in data processing service fees of thousand due to a change in computer processing systems and an increase in other expenses of thousand 
the primary reason for the increase in other expenses was thousand in higher expenditures for promotions  advertising and marketing 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in professional fees during fiscal of thousand due to consulting fees incurred during fiscal relating to a tax planning strategy implemented during fiscal income taxes 
the effective rates of income tax expense for the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
the change among years is primarily due to variations in the bank s state taxes 
such variations reflect differences in the utilization of the bank s reit subsidiary 
in june  the bank received from the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue dor a notice of intent to assess additional state excise taxes of thousand plus interest and penalties with respect to its tax years ended march  and the bank is aware that the dor has sent similar notices to numerous other financial institutions in massachusetts that reported a deduction for dividends received from a reit during this period 
assessed amounts ultimately paid  if any  would be deductible expenses for federal income tax purposes 
the dor contends that dividend distributions by the bank s reit to the bank are fully taxable in massachusetts 
the bank believes that the massachusetts statute that provides for a dividends received deduction equal to of certain dividend distributions applies to the distributions made by the bank s reit 
accordingly  no provision has been made in the company s consolidated financial statements for the amounts assessed or additional amounts that might be assessed in the future 
the bank intends to vigorously appeal the assessment and to pursue all available means to defend its position 
financial condition total assets at march  amounted to million  an increase of million from million at march  total assets at march  amounted to million  an increase of million from million at march  during fiscal  increases in the bank s borrowed funds and the liquidation of short term investments were used to fund the increase in loans and investments and the decrease in deposits 
net loans increased million to million at march  from million at march  at march   mortgage loans were million  a million increase from march  the increase in mortgage loans was primarily attributable to increases in commercial real estate and construction loans which increased million and million  respectively 
the growth in commercial real estate loans and construction loans is attributable to the addition of experienced commercial lenders and expansion of the credit administration function during the past year 
during the year ended march   the bank originated and purchased loans totaling million 
total loans originated and purchased during the year ended march   amounted to million 
total deposits at march  were million  a million decrease from million one year earlier 
this decrease is attributable to a decline in certificates of deposit of million  partially offset by an increase in core deposits of million 
the significant decrease in certificates of deposits reflects management s decision to be less aggressive in its pricing of such deposits in advances from the fhlb of boston increased to million at march  from million at march  the bank increased its borrowings from the fhlb of boston in fiscal to partially fund loan growth and the reduction in certificates of deposit 
stockholders equity increased to million at march  from million at march  due to million in comprehensive income  thousand in proceeds from option exercises and thousand in amortization in unearned esop compensation 
the increases in these equity accounts were partially offset by million in treasury stock purchases and thousand in dividends paid 
liquidity the bank s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  amortization and repayments of loan and mortgage backed security principal  fhlb of boston advances and maturities of various other investments 
these various sources of liquidity  as well as the bank s ability to sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  are used to fund deposit withdrawals  loan originations and investments 
deposits have been a relatively stable source of funds for the bank despite increasing competition in recent years 
during fiscal  deposit balances decreased by million to million from million at march  the mix of deposits changed significantly during fiscal with term deposit certificates decreasing million while core deposit accounts increased million 
this shift occurred due to the bank s emphasis of its core deposit products and less aggressive pricing of term deposits 
the bank is a member of the fhlb of boston and has the ability to borrow from the fhlb of boston for any sound business purpose for which the bank has legal authority  subject to such regulations and limitations as may be prescribed 
at march  and  the bank had outstanding fhlb of boston advances of million and million  respectively 
the deposits and fhlb advances were used to fund the bank s lending and investing activities during the year 
the fhlb of boston advances are secured by a blanket lien on residential first mortgage loans  us government and agency securities and all stock in the fhlb of boston 
as a member of the co operative central bank  the bank also has the right to borrow from that organization for short term cash needs  by pledging certain assets 
the bank also may obtain funds from the federal reserve bank of boston by pledging certain of the bank s notes and drafts 
the bank has not exercised these rights 
at march   outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans totaled million  and commitments for unadvanced funds on home equity  commercial and construction loans totaled million 
currently  the bank is not selling mortgage loans in the secondary market 
management believes that the bank has adequate sources of liquidity to fund these commitments 
capital resources the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios pursuant to federal banking regulations 
the first standard establishes a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations 
two categories of capital are defined tier or core capital stockholders equity and tier or supplementary capital 
total capital is the sum of both tier and tier capital 
according to the standards  tier capital must represent at least of qualifying total capital 
at march   the minimum total risk based capital ratio required was 
the company s and the bank s risk based total capital ratios at march  were and  respectively 
to complement the risk based standards  the fdic adopted a leverage ratio stockholders equity divided by total average assets of for the most highly rated banks and for all others 
the leverage ratio is to be used in tandem with the risk based capital ratios as the minimum standards for banks 
the company s and the bank s leverage ratios were and  respectively  at march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the bank seeks to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rate  or market risk  through active monitoring and management of its interest rate risk exposure 
the policies and procedures for managing both on and off balance sheet activities are established by the bank s asset liability management committee alco 
the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors related activities on an ongoing basis 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and preserve capital  while adjusting the bank s asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the bank quantifies its interest rate risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model 
simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specific time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense under various rate scenarios 
the simulation is based on actual cash flows and assumptions of management about the future changes in interest rates and levels of activity loan originations  loan prepayments  deposit flows  etc 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  therefore  actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies 
the net interest income projection resulting from use of actual cash flows and management s assumptions is compared to net interest income projections based on an immediate shift of basis points upward and basis points downward basis points for due to the current low interest rate environment 
internal guidelines on interest rate risk state that for every basis points immediate shift in interest rates  estimated net interest income over the next twelve months should decline by no more than 
the following table indicates the estimated exposure  as a percentage of estimated net interest income  for the twelve month period following the date indicated assuming an immediate shift in interest rates as set forth below march  basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates only basis point decrease in rates only for each one percentage point change in net interest income in the projections  the effect on net income would be thousand assuming a tax rate
