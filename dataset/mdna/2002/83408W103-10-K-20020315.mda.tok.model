item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sohu  having introduced the first chinese language online directory  is a leading internet portal in china in terms of brand recognition and the largest in terms of page views and registered users 
we averaged million page views per day for the month of december  a increase from million per day averaged in december registered users totaled million as of december   up from million as of january  we were incorporated in delaware  usa during august as internet technologies china incorporated and in september we changed our corporate name to sohu 
com inc on october   sohu acquired chinaren for total consideration of million  comprising  shares of sohu common stock with an aggregate market value of approximately million  stock options granted to chinaren employees to purchase  shares of sohu common stock valued at million and other acquisition costs aggregating million 
revenues and expenses from chinaren s operations after the acquisition date have been included in sohu s consolidated financial statements 
we have incurred significant net losses and have negative cash flows from operations since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have been funded with proceeds of preferred stock private placements and our initial public offering completed in july we intend to continue spending on marketing and brand development  content enhancements  technology and infrastructure 
as a result  we anticipate net losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate funding these expected losses with the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering 
sohu s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon sohu s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires sohu to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  sohu evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
sohu believes accounting for advertising revenue where multiple elements exist  allowance for doubtful accounts  and impairment of intangible assets represent critical accounting policies which reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising pursuant to short term contracts normally less than twelve months 
online advertising includes banners  links  logos and buttons placed on sohu s web sites and sponsorship of a particular area of the web sites 
contracts for advertising services are generally for a fixed payment over a contract period 
for contracts where services are provided evenly over the period or where sohu is unable to reasonably determine the fair value of the individual services provided in multiple element contracts revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
for multiple element contracts where sohu is able to reasonably determine the fair value of the individual services provided  the contract value is allocated among specific services provided and revenue is recognized in the period the services are performed 
in estimating the fair value of individual services provided  we make estimates based on the value of similar services provided to our customers using average sell rates for the period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowance might be required 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining balance of identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to our acquisition of chinaren 
this was the result of sohu s impairment assessment which was based upon expected gross cash flows over the assets estimated useful lives 
if different judgments or estimates were utilized  material differences could have resulted in the amount and timing of the impairment charge

the year to year increases in absolute dollars were primarily attributable to the acquisition of chinaren in october  the increase in the number of personnel and related personnel costs  as well as the costs incurred during the preliminary project stage of new product development projects  such as the development of our branded content channels and the upgrading of our chinese key word search software and e mail service  and launching our subscription and e commerce services 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  sales and marketing expenses were million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the decrease from was primarily due to the reduction of million in advertising expenses because of lower spending on sohu branding 
during the year ended december   the increase from was primarily due to an increase related to the launch of new advertising campaigns  including print  radio and billboard advertising  an increase in personnel costs associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing staff in shanghai  guangzhou  and hong kong  and the acquisition of chinaren in october advertising expenses constituted approximately   and of our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december    and  respectively

there was no non operating expense during the year ended december  interest income  net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  from is primarily attributable to federal reserve interest rate cuts and decreasing balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities

sohu invests its excess cash in marketable debt securities of high quality investment grade 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities totaling approximately million compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily attributable to our net loss of million and the payment of million for accounts payable  largely offset by the non cash amortization and impairment of intangible assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in payables to related parties of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in prepaid and other current assets of million  offset by amortization of intangible assets of million and depreciation and amortization of million and other non cash expenses of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily due to our net loss of million largely offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to long term investments in marketable debt securities of million and the acquisition of fixed assets of million  long term loans to related parties of million for financing an investment in high century and the acquisition of other assets of  we classify the investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date as held to maturity investments 
we have both the intent and the ability to hold these marketable securities until maturity 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the purchase of fixed assets of million and cash used in the acquisition of chinaren  inc of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the purchase of fixed assets of million and the acquisition of other assets of million 
there was no significant cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of series d convertible preferred stock in february and of approximately million from the completion of our initial public offering in july net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to net proceeds of million from issuance of convertible promissory notes and million from issuance of series c convertible preferred stock 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under various operating leases for office facilities 
we expect that capital expenditures totaling million in will primarily consist of purchases of additional servers  computer software  workstations and technological improvements to network infrastructure 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet anticipated significant increases in working capital net cash used in operating activities  commitments and capital expenditures cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy cash requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations 
financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in november  sohu entered into a loan and share pledge agreement with dr 
charles zhang  and li wei  one of our employees  to lend million to them for the purpose of funding their equity investments in high century 
pursuant to the loan agreement  in december sohu disbursed million to them  and in january and february  sohu disbursed an additional million to them for purposes of increasing their equity investments in high century 
in march  sohu approved high century s committing million for investment in a prc joint venture 
we expect that we will continue to be involved in and provide financial support to high century 
foreign currency exchange losses while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date virtually all of our revenues and costs are denominated in renminbi and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in renminbi 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi 
if the renminbi depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our renminbi revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange losses if the renminbi depreciates relative to the us dollar 
the renminbi is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in chinese renminbi 
thus  revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the renminbi when financial results are translated in us dollars on consolidation 
currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting the ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if the renminbi were to decline in value  reducing revenue in us dollar terms 
we have not tried to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions but may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on us in the fiscal year ended december  was not material 
investment risk a investments in high century we have entered into arrangements with dr 
charles zhang  our chief executive officer and a major sohu stockholder  and certain of our employees to satisfy prc regulations which prohibit or restrict foreign companies from owning or operating telecommunications  internet content and certain other businesses in china 
we expect that we will continue to be involved in and provide additional financial support under similar arrangements in the future 
in november  we entered into a loan and share pledge agreement with dr 
charles zhang  and li wei  another sohu employee  for the purpose of funding an equity investment of  in high century  a company incorporated in the prc which engages in investment holding in the prc on behalf of sohu 
pursuant to the loan agreement  sohu is required to extend total loans amounting to  of which  and  would be loaned to charles zhang and li wei  respectively 
as of december   sohu had remitted  and  to dr 
charles zhang and li wei  respectively 
in january and february  sohu loaned an additional  to dr 
charles zhang and  to li wei under the loan agreement for purposes of increasing their equity investments in high century to  in march  sohu approved high century s committing  for investment in a prc joint venture 
the loan agreement  which is subject to prc law  includes provisions that i the loans can only be repaid to sohu by transferring the shares of high century to sohu  ii the shares of high century cannot be transferred without the approval of sohu  and iii sohu has the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of high century 
charles zhang and li wei have pledged all of their shares in high century as collateral for the loans and the loans bear no interest and are due on demand after november or at such time as dr 
charles zhang or li wei  as the case may be  is not an employee of sohu 
sohu does not intend to request repayment of the loans as long as prc regulations prohibit sohu from directly investing in businesses being undertaken by high century 
these loans are included in long term loans to related parties 
as of december   payable to related party includes  payable to high century for amounts borrowed by sohu from high century 
the entire payable was remitted by sohu to high century in january prc regulations currently restrict sohu from holding direct equity interests in high century  therefore  the financial statements of these entities are not consolidated with those of sohu 
as of december   these loans are carried at cost which approximate the net assets of high century 
if the investment in high century had been consolidated  there would have been no material impact to the consolidated net assets of sohu 
b investments in a privately held company in the year  we invested million in a privately held company for business and strategic purposes 
this investment was included in other assets and accounted for under the cost method as ownership is less than  and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over its operations 
in each of the years ended december  and  we identified and recorded impairment losses of  thus  as of december  the investment has been fully written off 
c investment in marketable debt securities sohu invests in marketable debt securities to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
these marketable debt securities are classified as held to maturity 
as of december   the difference between the recorded cost and the fair value was not significant
