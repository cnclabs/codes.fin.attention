as a result of the merger  bulk deliveries increased to billion in the fiscal year ended september  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
revenue from bulk deliveries increased versus billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis

as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to prior year percentages of on a historical basis and on a pro forma combined basis 
the increase in the gross profit percentage from prior fiscal year historical results was primarily due to the inclusion of pharmerica in the current year 
pharmerica  due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business  has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the company s pharmaceutical distribution segment

the increases in the dsad a percentage from the prior fiscal year historical results were primarily due to the inclusion of pharmerica in the current year  as explained above 
the decrease in the dsad a percentage from the prior fiscal year pro forma combined ratio reflects improvements in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to customer mix changes  operational efficiencies and benefits from the merger integration effort 
in connection with the merger  the company has developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions  which are expected to result in synergies of approximately million annually by the end of the third year following the merger 
the company s plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of facilities in the next four to five years 
this will be accomplished by building six new facilities  expanding seven facilities  and closing facilities

table of contents segment information pharmaceutical distribution segment pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of billion for the fiscal year ended september  increased from billion in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased from billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis 
during the fiscal year ended september   of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from retail customers  this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail on a historical basis and institutional and retail on a pro forma combined basis 
in comparison with prior fiscal year pro forma combined results  sales to institutional customers increased by primarily due to higher revenues from mail order facilities  absg s specialty pharmaceutical business and alternate site facilities 
sales to retail customers increased over the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis  principally due to higher revenues from regional drug store chains  including the pharmacy departments of supermarkets 
this segment s growth largely reflects national industry economic conditions  including increases in prescription drug usage and higher pharmaceutical prices 
operating revenue increased in the first half of the year and in the second half of the year when compared to the same periods in the prior year on a pro forma combined basis as the company reached the april anniversary date of the addition of a large mail order customer 
future operating revenue growth may be impacted by customer consolidation and competition within the industry  as well as by industry growth rates 
industry growth rates  as estimated by ims healthcare  inc  are expected to be between and over the next four years  reflecting the impact of billion of brand name drug patent expirations expected between and and a slowdown in the introduction of significant new drugs in pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of  million in the fiscal year ended september  increased from million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased from  million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to prior fiscal year percentages of on a historical basis and on a pro forma combined basis 
the year to year declines reflect the net impact of a number of factors  including the change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional  mail order and chain accounts  and the continuing competitive pricing environment  offset  in part  by higher buy side margins than in the prior year 
downward pressures on sell side gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that increases in the buy side component of the gross margin  including benefits derived from manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals  will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline 
the company s cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of million in the fiscal year ended september  increased from million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased from million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating expenses in the fiscal year ended september  were  as compared to prior year percentages of on a historical basis and on a pro forma combined basis 
these decreases in expense percentages reflect the changing customer mix described above  efficiencies of scale  the elimination of redundant costs through the merger integration process and the continued emphasis on productivity throughout the company s distribution network 
pharmaceutical distribution operating income of million in the fiscal year ended september  increased from million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased from million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income was in the fiscal year ended september   as compared to prior year percentages of on a historical basis  and on a pro forma combined basis 
the improvement over the prior year pro forma combined percentage was due to a reduction in the operating expense ratio  which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin 
the reduction of the operating expense ratio was partially due to the company s ability to capture synergy cost savings from the merger 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so  there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible declines in gross margins 
additionally  there can be no assurance that merger integration efforts will proceed as planned and result in the desired synergies 

table of contents pharmerica segment the pharmerica segment was acquired in connection with the merger and the historical amounts for the fiscal year ended september  are comprised of only one month of pharmerica s operating results 
accordingly  the discussion below focuses all comparisons with the prior year on a pro forma combined basis

pharmerica s gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased from gross profit of million in the prior fiscal year 
pharmerica s gross profit margin declined to for the fiscal year ended september  from in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily the result of a change in the sales mix  with a greater proportion of pharmerica s current year revenues coming from its workers compensation business  which has lower gross profit margins and lower operating expenses than its long term care business 
in addition  industry competitive pressures continue to adversely affect gross profit margins 
pharmerica s operating expenses of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased from operating expenses of million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating expenses were reduced to in the fiscal year ended september  from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage reduction is due to several factors  including the aforementioned shift in customer mix towards the workers compensation business  consolidation of technology platforms  the consolidation or sale of several pharmacies  and a reduction in bad debt expense 
pharmerica s operating income of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased compared to operating income of million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income was in the fiscal year ended september   an increase of basis points from in the prior fiscal year 
the year to year improvement in the operating income percentage was due to the aforementioned reductions in the operating expense ratio  which were greater than the reductions in gross profit margin

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company through its pharmaceutical service activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  the company considers a combination of factors  such as industry trends  its customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a substantial amount of judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables 
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of the company s inventories at september  and  respectively  is determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if the company had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and million higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
accordingly  the company ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of october  intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer lists and patents  will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
the company completed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
stock options the company has the choice to account for stock options using either accounting principles board opinion no 
apb or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company has elected to use the accounting method under apb and the related interpretations to account for its stock options 
under apb  generally  when the exercise price of the company s stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
had the company elected to use sfas no 
to account for its stock options under the fair value method  it would have been required to record compensation expense and as a result  diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended september   and would have been lower by   and  respectively

 which revised the accounting and financial reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets

 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 the company did not amortize goodwill arising from the merger in fiscal in fiscal  the company discontinued the amortization of all goodwill 
had the company not amortized goodwill during fiscal and  net income for the fiscal years ended september  and would have been approximately million and million higher than the reported amounts  respectively  and diluted earnings per share would have been higher than the reported amount in each year 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company was required to complete an initial impairment test of goodwill within six months of adopting the standard  with any impairment charges recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company completed its initial impairment test in the quarter ended march  and determined that no impairment existed 
the company completed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment existed

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard sets forth the accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  whether they are held and used or are disposed of by sale or other means

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs incurred in a restructuring 
this standard addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these costs relate to termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated  costs to terminate a contract  and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under sfas no 
 an entity s commitment to a plan does not by itself create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for the initial liability 
the standard will be effective for exit costs or disposal activities initiated after december   although early adoption is encouraged 
the company elected to adopt this standard in september the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended september  we have traditionally recognized certain costs associated with restructuring plans as of the date of commitment to the plan 
the adoption of sfas no 
could result in the deferral of recognition of such costs for restructuring plans from the date we commit to a plan to the date we actually incur the costs associated with a plan
