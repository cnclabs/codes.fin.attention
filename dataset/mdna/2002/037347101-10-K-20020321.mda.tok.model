item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under risk factors herein 
general we were formed in october to invest primarily in mortgage related assets  including mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage loans and other securities representing interests in  or obligations backed by  pools of mortgage loans which can be readily financed 
we commenced operations on march  upon the closing of our initial public offering 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to stockholders based upon the spread between the interest income on our mortgage backed securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of mortgage backed securities 
over the past year  the dramatic decline in the general level of interest rates has had a materially positive impact on our financial results 
as a result of the interest rate reductions by the federal reserve board  the one month treasury bill has declined from as of december  to as of december  this decline has reduced the rates at which we borrow funds to finance our portfolio holdings 
our cost of financing has declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this contrasts significantly with the much less substantial decline of our asset yield from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we are organized for tax purposes as a reit 
accordingly  we generally distribute substantially all of our earnings to stockholders without paying federal or state income tax at the corporate level on the distributed earnings 
as of december   our qualified reit assets real estate assets  as defined in the tax code  cash and cash items and government securities were greater than of our total assets  as compared to the tax code requirement that at least of our total assets must be qualified reit assets 
greater than of our revenue qualifies for both the source of income test and the source of income test under the reit rules 
we believe we met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distributions of our net income 
therefore  we believe that we continue to qualify as a reit under the provisions of the tax code 
results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december   our net income was  or per share diluted  based on an average of  shares outstanding

during the year ended december   we incurred general and administrative expenses of  consisting of operating expense of  a base management fee of  and an incentive management fee of  by comparison  our net income was  for the year ended december  the increase in our profitability in over was due to the sharp decline in the general level of interest rates  allowing us to decrease our borrowing expense at a rate far greater than the rate at which the interest income on our assets declined

by comparison  our net income was  for the year ended december   our first full year of operation 
the increase in our profitability in over was due to an increase in interest income  which rose faster than interest expense due to the continued slowing of prepayment of our mortgage assets in  a trend which began in in addition  our operating expenses decreased by  our annual return on average equity was for the year ended december  this return compares favorably to the figure of

of the adjustable rate mortgage backed securities owned by us  were adjustable rate pass through certificates that reset at least once a year 
the remaining were and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have an initial interest rate that is fixed for a certain period  usually three to five years  and then adjust annually for the remainder of the term of the loan

we analyze our mortgage backed securities and the extent to which prepayments impact the yield of the securities 
when actual prepayments exceed expectations  we amortize the premiums paid on mortgage assets over a shorter time period  resulting in a reduced yield to maturity on our mortgage assets 
conversely  if actual prepayments are less than the assumed constant prepayment rate  the premium would be amortized over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
we monitor our prepayment expectations versus our actual prepayment experience on a monthly basis in order to adjust the amortization of the net premium 
as of december   the fair value of our portfolio of mortgage related assets classified as available for sale was million  or  greater than the amortized cost of our portfolio 
hedging we have not entered into any hedging agreements to date 
as part of our asset liability management policy  we may enter into hedging agreements such as interest rate caps  floors or swaps 
these agreements would be entered into to try to reduce interest rate risk and would be designed to provide us with income and capital appreciation in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
we review the need for hedging agreements on a regular basis consistent with our capital investment policy 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds consists of repurchase agreements  which totaled million at december  our other significant source of funds for the year ended december  consisted of payments of principal and interest from our mortgage securities portfolio in the amount of million 
as of december   we had raised approximately million in capital under our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan   of which was raised in in the future  we expect that our primary sources of funds will consist of borrowed funds under repurchase agreement transactions with one to twelve month maturities and of monthly payments of principal and interest on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
our liquid assets generally consist of unpledged mortgage backed securities  cash and cash equivalents 
our borrowings had a weighted average interest cost during the year ended december  of compared with for the year ended december  as of december   all of our repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from three to eighteen months 
on december   we had borrowing arrangements with eleven different financial institutions and had borrowed funds under repurchase agreements with eight of these firms 
because we borrow money based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities and because increases in short term interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of mortgage backed securities  our borrowing ability could be limited and lenders may initiate margin calls in the event short term interest rates increase or the value of our mortgage backed securities declines for other reasons 
during the year ended december   we had adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements during the period 
from time to time  we raise additional equity dependent upon market conditions and other factors 
in that regard  we completed a public offering and a private placement on december  that raised approximately million in combined net proceeds  and we completed a public offering on february  that raised approximately million in net proceeds 
stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our mortgage backed securities 
these assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon such available for sale treatment  our equity base at december  was million  or per share 
with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in fair values of assets do not impact gaap income or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
unrealized changes in the fair value of mortgage backed securities have one significant and direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes will tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mortgage backed securities might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities was million  or of the amortized cost of mortgage backed securities at december  risk factors risks related to our business interest rate mismatches between our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of the assets may reduce our income during periods of changing interest rates 
we fund most of our acquisitions of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage backed securities 
accordingly  if short term interest rates increase  this may adversely affect our profitability 
most of the mortgage backed securities we acquire are adjustable rate securities 
this means that their interest rates may vary over time based upon changes in a short term interest rate index 
therefore  in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgage backed securities that we acquire and their funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
while the historical spread between relevant short term interest rate indices has been relatively stable  there have been periods when the spread between these indices was volatile 
during periods of changing interest rates  these mismatches could reduce our net income  dividend yield and the market price of our common stock 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
for example  on december   our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months  while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss because the interest rates on our borrowings adjust faster than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
we may experience reduced net interest income from holding fixed rate investments during periods of rising interest rates 
we generally fund our acquisition of fixed rate mortgage backed securities with short term borrowings 
during periods of rising interest rates  our costs associated with borrowings used to fund acquisition of fixed rate assets are subject to increases while the income we earn from these assets remains substantially fixed 
this reduces the net interest spread between the fixed rate mortgage backed securities that we purchase and our borrowings used to purchase them  which could lower our net interest income or cause us to suffer a loss 
on december   of our mortgaged backed securities were fixed rate securities 
increased levels of prepayments from mortgage backed securities may decrease our net interest income 
pools of mortgage loans underlie the mortgage backed securities that we acquire 
we generally receive payments from the payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans 
when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected  this results in prepayments that are faster than expected on the mortgage backed securities 
faster than expected prepayments could adversely affect our profitability  including in the following ways 
we often purchase mortgage backed securities that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we must pay a premium over the market value to acquire the security 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mortgage backed security 
if the mortgage backed security is prepaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity date  however  we must expense the premium that was prepaid at the time of the prepayment 
on december   approximately of our mortgage backed securities were acquired at a premium 

we anticipate that a substantial portion of our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may bear interest rates that are lower than their fully indexed rates  which are equivalent to the applicable index rate plus a margin 
if an adjustable rate mortgage backed security is prepaid prior to or soon after the time of adjustment to a fully indexed rate  we will have held that mortgage backed security while it was less profitable and lost the opportunity to receive interest at the fully indexed rate over the remainder of its expected life 

if we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  results of operation and cash flow would suffer 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
prepayment rates also may be affected by conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
while we seek to minimize prepayment risk to the extent practical  in selecting investments we must balance prepayment risk against other risks and the potential returns of each investment 
no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment risk 
we may incur increased borrowing costs related to repurchase agreements and that would adversely affect our profitability 
currently  all of our borrowings are collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
if the interest rates on these repurchase agreements increase  that would adversely affect our profitability 
our borrowing costs under repurchase agreements generally correspond to short term interest rates such as libor or a short term treasury index  plus or minus a margin 
the margins on these borrowings over or under short term interest rates may vary depending upon 
the movement of interest rates  
the availability of financing in the market  and 
the value and liquidity of our mortgage backed securities 
interest rate caps on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may reduce our income or cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates 
our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase during any given period 
lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase through maturity of a mortgage backed security 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
accordingly  in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates  the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while caps would limit the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
this problem is magnified for our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are not fully indexed 
further  some adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
as a result  we could receive less cash income on adjustable rate mortgage backed securities than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings 
on december   approximately of our mortgage backed securities were adjustable rate securities 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause us to suffer a net loss during periods of rising interest rates 
our leveraging strategy increases the risks of our operations 
we generally borrow between eight and twelve times the amount of our equity  although our borrowings may at times be above or below this amount 
we incur this leverage by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of our mortgage backed securities 
use of leverage can enhance our investment returns 
however  leverage also increases risks 
in the following ways  the use of leverage increases our risk of loss and may reduce our net income by increasing the risks associated with other risk factors  including a decline in the market value of our mortgage backed securities or a default of a mortgage related asset 
the use of leverage increases our risk of loss resulting from various factors  including rising interest rates  increased interest rate volatility  downturns in the economy  reductions in the availability of financing or deteriorations in the conditions of any of our mortgage related assets 

a majority of our borrowings are secured by our mortgage backed securities  generally under repurchase agreements 
a decline in the market value of the mortgage backed securities used to secure these debt obligations could limit our ability to borrow or result in lenders requiring us to pledge additional collateral to secure our borrowings 
in that situation  we could be required to sell mortgage backed securities under adverse market conditions in order to obtain the additional collateral required by the lender 
if these sales are made at prices lower than the carrying value of the mortgage backed securities  we would experience losses 

a default of a mortgage related asset that constitutes collateral for a loan could also result in an involuntary liquidation of the mortgage related asset  including any cross collateralized mortgage backed securities 
this would result in a loss to us of the difference between the value of the mortgage related asset upon liquidation and the amount borrowed against the mortgage related asset 

to the extent we are compelled to liquidate qualified reit assets to repay debts  our compliance with the reit rules regarding our assets and our sources of income could be negatively affected  which would jeopardize our status as a reit 
losing our reit status would cause us to lose tax advantages applicable to reits and may decrease our overall profitability and distributions to our stockholders 
we have not used derivatives to mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks and this leaves us exposed to certain risks 
our policies permit us to enter into interest rate swaps  caps and floors and other derivative transactions to help us reduce our interest rate and prepayment risks described above 
however  so far we have determined that the costs of these transactions outweigh their benefits 
this strategy saves us the additional costs of such hedging transactions  but it leaves us exposed to the types of risks that such hedging transactions would be designed to reduce 
if we decide to enter into derivative transactions in the future  these transactions may mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks but cannot eliminate these risks 
additionally  the use of derivative transactions could have a negative impact on our earnings 
an increase in interest rates may adversely affect our book value 
increases in interest rates may negatively affect the market value of our mortgage related assets 
our fixed rate securities are generally more negatively affected by these increases 
in accordance with accounting rules  we reduce our book value by the amount of any decrease in the market value of our mortgage related assets 
we may invest in leveraged mortgage derivative securities that generally experience greater volatility in market prices  thus exposing us to greater risk with respect to their rate of return 
we may acquire leveraged mortgage derivative securities that may expose us to a high level of interest rate risk 
the characteristics of leveraged mortgage derivative securities result in greater volatility in their market prices 
thus  acquisition of leveraged mortgage derivative securities would expose us to the risk of greater volatility in our portfolio and that could adversely affect our net income and overall profitability 
we depend on borrowings to purchase mortgage related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage 
if we fail to obtain or renew sufficient funding on favorable terms  we will be limited in our ability to acquire mortgage related assets and our earnings and profitability could decline 
we depend on short term borrowings to fund acquisitions of mortgage related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage 
accordingly  our ability to achieve our investment and leverage objectives depends on our ability to borrow money in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms 
in addition  we must be able to renew or replace our maturing short term borrowings on a continuous basis 
moreover  we depend on a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for our purchases of mortgage related assets 
if we cannot renew or replace maturing borrowings  we may have to sell our mortgage related assets under adverse market conditions and may incur permanent capital losses as a result 
any number of these factors in combination may cause difficulties for us  including a possible liquidation of a major portion of our portfolio at disadvantageous prices with consequent losses  which may render us insolvent 
possible market developments could cause our lenders to require us to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if our assets are insufficient to meet the collateral requirements  then we may be compelled to liquidate particular assets at an inopportune time 
possible market developments  including a sharp rise in interest rates  a change in prepayment rates or increasing market concern about the value or liquidity of one or more types of mortgage related assets in which our portfolio is concentrated  may reduce the market value of our portfolio  which may cause our lenders to require additional collateral 
this requirement for additional collateral may compel us to liquidate our assets at a disadvantageous time  thus adversely affecting our operating results and net profitability 
our use of repurchase agreements to borrow funds may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or a lender files for bankruptcy 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code  giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and to take possession of and liquidate our collateral under the repurchase agreements without delay in the event that we file for bankruptcy 
furthermore  the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that a lender files for bankruptcy 
thus  the use of repurchase agreements exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either a lender or us 
because assets we acquire may experience periods of illiquidity  we may lose profits or be prevented from earning capital gains if we cannot sell mortgage related assets at an opportune time 
we bear the risk of being unable to dispose of our mortgage related assets at advantageous times or in a timely manner because mortgage related assets generally experience periods of illiquidity 
the lack of liquidity may result from the absence of a willing buyer or an established market for these assets  as well as legal or contractual restrictions on resale 
as a result  the illiquidity of mortgage related assets may cause us to lose profits or the ability to earn capital gains 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of any of our key personnel could severely and detrimentally affect our operations 
we depend on the diligence  experience and skill of our officers and the people working on behalf of our management company for the selection  structuring and monitoring of our mortgage related assets and associated borrowings 
our key officers include lloyd mcadams  president  chairman of our board of directors and chief executive officer  pamela j 
watson  chief financial officer and treasurer  evangelos karagiannis  vice president and joseph mcadams  vice president 
we have not entered into employment agreements with our senior officers  nor do we require the management company to employ specific personnel or to dedicate employees solely to our business 
these individuals are free to engage in competitive activities in our industry 
the loss of any key person could harm our entire business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
our board of directors may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval and such changes could harm our business  results of operation and stock price 
our board of directors can modify or waive our current operating policies and our strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval 
we cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies may have on our business  operating results and stock price  however  the effects may be adverse 
competition may prevent us from acquiring mortgage related assets at favorable yields and that would negatively impact our profitability 
our net income largely depends on our ability to acquire mortgage related assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs 
in acquiring mortgage related assets  we compete with other reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  banks  insurance companies  mutual funds  other lenders and other entities that purchase mortgage related assets  many of which have greater financial resources than us 
as a result we may not in the future be able to acquire sufficient mortgage related assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs 
if that occurs  our profitability will be harmed 
our investment policy involves risks associated with the credit quality of our investments 
if the credit quality of our investments declines or if there are defaults on the investments we make  our profitability may decline and we may suffer losses 
our mortgage backed securities have primarily been agency certificates that  although not rated  carry an implied aaa rating 
agency certificates are mortgage backed securities where either freddie mac or fannie mae guarantees payments of principal or interest on the certificates 
our capital investment policy  however  provides us with the ability to acquire a material amount of lower credit quality mortgage backed securities 
if we acquire mortgage backed securities of lower credit quality  our profitability may decline and we may incur losses if there are defaults on the mortgages backing those securities or if the rating agencies downgrade the credit quality of those securities 
risks related to our management company our management company and its affiliates may allocate mortgage related opportunities to other entities  and thus may divert attractive investment opportunities away from us 
our management company is anworth mortgage advisory corporation 
lloyd mcadams  joseph mcadams and evangelos karagiannis work on behalf of our management company to manage our funds 
affiliates of our management company and some of our officers manage mortgage backed securities for other parties 
messrs 
l 
mcadams  j 
mcadams and karagiannis are actively involved in managing approximately billion in mortgage backed securities and other fixed income assets for institutional clients and individual investors through pacific income advisers  which is under common control with our management company 
messrs 
l 
mcadams  j 
mcadams and karagiannis intend to continue to perform services for pacific income advisers 
these multiple responsibilities may create conflicts of interest for these officers if they are presented with opportunities that may benefit us and the clients of pacific income advisers 
these officers allocate investments among our portfolio and the clients of pacific income advisers by determining the entity or account for which the investment is most suitable 
in making this determination  these officers consider the investment strategy and guidelines of each entity or account with respect to acquisition of assets  leverage  liquidity and other factors that our officers determine appropriate 
however  our management company and those working on its behalf have no obligation to make any specific investment opportunities available to us and the above mentioned conflicts of interest may result in decisions or allocations of securities that are not in our best interests 
the compensation structure for our management company creates an incentive for our management company to increase the riskiness of our mortgage portfolio in an attempt to increase its compensation 
in addition to its base management compensation  our management company earns incentive compensation for each fiscal year equal to of the amount by which our return on equity each year exceeds a return based on the ten year united states treasury rate plus 
as a result  our management company shares in our profits but not in our losses 
consequently  as our management company evaluates different mortgage backed securities for our investment and other investments  there is a risk that our management company will cause us to assume more risk than is prudent in an attempt to increase its incentive compensation 
other key criteria related to determining appropriate investments and investment strategies  including the preservation of capital  may be unduly ignored at the expense of our management company s emphasis on maximizing its income 
since our management company may receive a significant fee if we terminate the management agreement  we may not be able to economically terminate the management agreement in the event that our management company fails to meet our expectations 
if we terminate the management agreement  or if we decide not to renew it  then we may have to pay a significant fee to our management company 
the actual amount of the fee is not known because the fair market value of the management agreement cannot be determined in advance with certainty 
paying this fee would reduce the cash available for distribution to stockholders and may cause us to suffer a net operating loss 
consequently  we may not be able to terminate the management agreement economically even if we are dissatisfied with our management company s performance  or if we determine that it would be more efficient to operate with an internal management structure 
we have recently entered into an option agreement with the stockholder of our management company pursuant to which we have been granted an option to acquire our management company  subject to several conditions being met  including the negotiation of employment agreements with members of our management  establishment of and increases to new and existing benefit plans and extension of our services agreement with pacific income advisors 
although we have no obligation to exercise the option  as noted above  if we are dissatisfied with the performance of our management company and desire to terminate the management agreement  we could be forced to pay a termination fee 
under such circumstances  it is highly unlikely we would desire to fulfill the conditions necessary to exercise our option and  even if we desired to do so  the termination fee relating to our management contract could exceed the agreed upon option price under the option agreement 
consequently  investors in our common stock should not view our ability to exercise the option to purchase our management company as providing any economic advantage to us in the event we are dissatisfied with the performance of our management company 
because our management company may render services to other mortgage investors  this could reduce the amount of time and effort that our management company devotes to us and  consequently  our profitability and overall management could suffer 
our agreement with our management company does not restrict the right of our management company  any persons working on its behalf or any of its affiliates from doing business  including the rendering of advice in the purchase of mortgage backed securities that meet our investment criteria  with any other person or entity 
in addition to our management company s ability to do business with any other third party  the management agreement does not specify a minimum time period that our management company and its personnel must devote to us 
the ability of our management company to engage in these other business activities could reduce the time and effort it spends managing us 
prior to its association with us  our management company had not managed a reit 
our management company has now managed us since our initial public offering in march of prior to its association with us  our management company had not previously managed a reit 
in particular  our management company had not managed a highly leveraged pool of mortgage assets or utilized hedging instruments  nor did our management company have experience in complying with the asset limitations imposed by the reit provisions of the united states internal revenue code referred to throughout this form k as the tax code 
although our management company now has more than three years of experience in managing our company  there can be no assurance that the experience of our executive officers and our management company is appropriate to our business 
further  the experience of the officers of our management company should not be viewed as a reliable gauge of our continued success 
we may not become an internally managed reit 
the option agreement that we entered into with our management company is subject to several conditions  including the conditions that the independent members of our board of directors have determined that a merger with our management company is in the best interests of our stockholders  we have received a fairness opinion from a reputable investment banking firm regarding the fairness of the consideration for the merger  and our stockholders have approved the merger 
as a result  there cannot be any assurance that a merger with our management company will be completed 
if a merger with our management company does not occur  we expect to continue to operate as an externally advised company under our existing management agreement with our management company 
this would prevent us from realizing the possible benefits of internal management 
our net income per share may decrease if we become internally managed 
if we become internally managed  we cannot guarantee that any anticipated cost savings from no longer paying the base management fee to our management company would offset the additional expenses that we would incur as an internally managed reit 
these additional expenses would include all of the salaries and benefits of our executive officers and the other employees that we would need to operate as an internally managed company 
in addition  we have agreed to adopt an incentive compensation plan for key executives if we become internally managed 
even if our earnings are not adversely affected  our earnings per share may decrease because we would be issuing additional shares of our common stock as merger consideration 
these additional shares would represent approximately of the total number of shares outstanding after the merger 
if we remain externally managed  the amount of the base and incentive management fees payable to our management company would depend on a number of factors  including the amount of additional equity  if any  that we are able to raise and the profitability of our business 
therefore  the exact amount of future fees that we would pay to our management company cannot be predicted with complete accuracy 
if the expenses we assume as an internally managed company are higher than we anticipate or the fees we would pay in the future to our management company as an externally managed company would have been lower than we anticipate  our net income per share may decrease as a result of becoming internally managed 
the number of shares we issue in the merger with our management company will not change to reflect changes in the relative value of our company and our management company after the date the option agreement was signed 
the number of shares of our common stock that would be issued in a merger with our management company is fixed 
therefore  it will not be reduced even if the market price of our common stock increases after the date the option agreement was signed 
likewise  it will not be reduced even if the value of our management company goes down after that date 
our value may change because of our financial results or other results of operations  changes in the economic sector in which we operate  changes in economic conditions generally and other factors that might affect our business  condition and prospects 
the merger with our management company may cause us to lose our reit status for tax purposes 
in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we are not permitted to have current or accumulated earnings and profits carried over from our management company 
if the irs successfully asserts that we acquired current or accumulated earnings and profits from our management company and failed to distribute  during the taxable year in which the merger occurs  all of such earnings and profits  we would lose our reit qualification for the year of the merger  as well as any other taxable years during which we held such acquired earnings and profits  unless  in the year of such determination  we make an additional distribution of the amount of earnings and profits determined to be acquired from our management company 
in order to make such an additional distribution  we could be required to borrow funds or sell assets even if prevailing market conditions were not generally favorable 
for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit  we would not be entitled to a deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders in calculating our taxable income 
consequently  our net assets and distributions to our stockholders would be substantially reduced because of our increased tax liability 
furthermore  to the extent that distributions have been made in anticipation of our qualification as a reit  we might also be required to borrow additional funds or to liquidate certain of our investments in order to pay the applicable tax on our income 
after a merger we would be subject to potential liability as an employer 
we do not directly employ any employees or maintain any benefit or retirement plans 
however  if we become internally managed  we expect to directly employ the persons who are currently employees of our management company 
in addition to their salaries and other cash compensation  we would need to establish certain health  retirement and other employee benefit plans  and we would bear the costs of the establishment and maintenance of these plans 
as an employer  we would be subject to potential liabilities that are commonly faced by employers  such as workers disability and compensation claims  potential labor disputes and other employee related liabilities and grievances 
risks related to reit compliance and other matters if we are disqualified as a reit  we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability 
we believe that since our initial public offering in we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the tax code  and we intend to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
however  we may not remain qualified as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex tax code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress or the irs might change tax laws or regulations and the courts might issue new rulings  in each case potentially having retroactive effect  that could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year  then 
we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation  which  among other things  means being unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  
any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders  and 
unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification  and thus  our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we do not qualify as a reit 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  our sources of income  the nature and diversification of our mortgage backed securities  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the tax code may substantially limit our ability to hedge mortgage backed securities and related borrowings by requiring us to limit our income in each year from qualified hedges  together with any other income not generated from qualified reit real estate assets  to less than of our gross income 
in addition  we must limit our aggregate income from hedging and services from all sources  other than from qualified reit real estate assets or qualified hedges  to less than of our annual gross income 
as a result  although we do not currently engage in hedging transactions  we may in the future have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques 
this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to incur 
if we were to violate the or limitations  we may have to pay a penalty tax equal to the amount of income in excess of those limitations  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
if we fail to satisfy the and limitations  unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we could lose our reit status for federal income tax purposes 
complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
in order to qualify as a reit  we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of our assets consists of cash  cash items  government securities and qualified reit real estate assets 
the remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
in addition  in general  no more than of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we must dispose of a portion of our assets within days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences 
complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 
as a reit  we must distribute with respect to taxable years beginning before january  of our annual taxable income subject to certain adjustments to our stockholders 
from time to time  we may generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes from  among other things  amortization of capitalized purchase premiums  or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders 
if we do not have other funds available in these situations  we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the reit provisions of the tax code 
thus  we could be required to borrow funds  sell a portion of our mortgage backed securities at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds 
these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity 
failure to maintain an exemption from the investment company act would adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that we conduct our business in a manner that allows us to avoid being regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
under the sec s current interpretation  qualification for this exemption generally requires us to maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying real estate interests 
in order to constitute a qualifying real estate interest under this requirement  a real estate interest must meet various criteria 
if we fail to continue to qualify for an exemption from registration as an investment company  our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and we would be unable to conduct our business as planned 
additional risk factors we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
we intend to pay quarterly dividends and to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year  subject to certain adjustments  is distributed 
this  along with other factors  should enable us to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the tax code 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this form k 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
we intend to seek to raise additional capital from time to time if we determine that it is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders 
if we raise additional capital  our earnings per share and dividend may decline since we may not be able to invest all of the new capital during the quarter in which additional shares are sold and possibly the entire following calendar quarter 
we may incur excess inclusion income that would increase the tax liability of our stockholders 
in general  dividend income that a tax exempt entity receives from us should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section of the tax code 
if we realize excess inclusion income and allocate it to stockholders  this income cannot be offset by net operating losses 
if the stockholder is a tax exempt entity  then this income would be fully taxable as unrelated business taxable income under section of the tax code 
if the stockholder is foreign  then it would be subject to federal income tax withholding on this income without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty 
excess inclusion income could result if we held a residual interest in a remic 
excess inclusion income also would be generated if we were to issue debt obligations with two or more maturities and the terms of the payments on these obligations bore a relationship to the payments that we received on our mortgage backed securities securing those debt obligations 
we generally structure our borrowing arrangements in a manner designed to avoid generating significant amounts of excess inclusion income 
we do  however  enter into various repurchase agreements that have differing maturity dates and afford the lender the right to sell any pledged mortgage securities if we default on our obligations 
the irs may determine that these borrowings give rise to excess inclusion income that should be allocated among stockholders 
furthermore  some types of tax exempt entities  including  without limitation  voluntary employee benefit associations and entities that have borrowed funds to acquire their shares of our common stock  may be required to treat a portion of or all of the dividends they may receive from us as unrelated business taxable income 
we also invest in equity securities of other reits 
if we were to receive excess inclusion income from another reit  we may be required to distribute the excess inclusion income to our shareholders  which may result in the recognition of unrelated business taxable income 
our charter does not permit ownership of over of our common or preferred stock and attempts to acquire our common or preferred stock in excess of the limit are void without prior approval from our board of directors 
for the purpose of preserving our reit qualification and for other reasons  our charter prohibits direct or constructive ownership by any person of more than of the lesser of the total number or value of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock 
our charter s constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of the outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of of the outstanding stock  and thus be subject to our charter s ownership limit 
any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common or preferred stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of the board of directors shall be void  and will result in the shares being transferred by operation of law to a charitable trust 
our board of directors has granted lloyd mcadams  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his family members an exemption from the ownership limitation as set forth in our charter documents 
this exemption permits mr 
mcadams  heather baines and joseph e 
mcadams collectively to hold up to of our outstanding shares 
because provisions contained in maryland law  our charter and our bylaws may have an anti takeover effect  investors may be prevented from receiving a control premium for their shares 
provisions contained in our charter and bylaws  as well as maryland corporate law  may have anti takeover effects that delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt  which may prevent stockholders from receiving a control premium for their shares 
for example  these provisions may defer or prevent tender offers for our common stock or purchases of large blocks of our common stock  thereby limiting the opportunities for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock over then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include the following 
ownership limit 
the ownership limit in our charter limits related investors  including  among other things  any voting group  from acquiring over of our common stock without our permission 

preferred stock 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more classes and to establish the preferences and rights of any class of preferred stock issued 
these actions can be taken without soliciting stockholder approval 

maryland business combination statute 
maryland law restricts the ability of holders of more than of the voting power of a corporation s shares to engage in a business combination with the corporation 

maryland control share acquisition statute 
maryland law limits the voting rights of control shares of a corporation in the event of a control share acquisition 
future offerings of debt securities  which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation  or equity securities  which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend distributions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred stock or common stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings by us may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
our preferred stock  if issued  would have a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity for stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through ownership of our common stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk we primarily invest in adjustable rate  hybrid and fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
hybrid mortgages are adjustable rate mortgages that have a fixed interest rate for an initial period of time typically three years or greater and then convert to a one year adjustable rate for the remaining loan term 
our borrowings are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates 
adjustable rate mortgage backed assets are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount an adjustable rate mortgage backed securities interest rate can change during any given period 
adjustable rate mortgage securities are also typically subject to a minimum interest rate payable 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
hence  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mortgage related assets could be limited 
this problem would be magnified to the extent we acquire mortgage backed securities that are not fully indexed 
further  some adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our liquidity  net income and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we fund the purchase of a substantial portion of our adjustable rate mortgage backed debt securities with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgage assets 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net income  dividend yield and the market price of our common stock 
most of our adjustable rate assets are based on the one year constant maturity treasury rate and our debt obligations are generally based on libor 
these indices generally move in parallel  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and borrowings reset at various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of our debt obligations occurs more quickly than on our assets 
therefore  on average  our cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does our earnings rate on the assets 
further  our net income may vary somewhat as the spread between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies 
as of december   our mortgage backed securities and borrowings will prospectively reprice based on the following time frames assets borrowings percent of total percent of total amount investments amount borrowings amounts in thousands investment type rate reset dates fixed rate investments  adjustable rate investments obligations less than months   greater than months and less than year   greater than year and less than years   greater than years and less than years  greater than years and less than years  total   excludes borrowings incurred to settle open asset purchases at december   which will reprice in less than three months 
market value risk substantially all of our mortgage backed securities and equity securities are classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie  market value with the adjustment to fair value reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the equity section of our balance sheet 
the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mortgage backed securities with short term debt 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
for example  at december   our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months  while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from mortgage backed securities 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss during these periods 
our assets that are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  we have not had difficulty rolling over our short term debt as it matures 
there can be no assurance that we will always be able to roll over our short term debt 
at december   we had million of debt which could be considered long term debt with a term greater than one year 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates on mortgage related securities vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of adjustable rate mortgage loans usually can be expected to increase when mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on such loans and decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such loans  although such effects are not predictable 
prepayment experience also may be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans underlying mortgage backed securities 
the purchase prices of mortgage backed securities are generally based upon assumptions regarding the expected amounts and rates of prepayments 
where slow prepayment assumptions are made  we may pay a premium for mortgage backed securities 
to the extent such assumptions differ from the actual amounts of prepayments  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
the total prepayment of any mortgage backed securities purchased at a premium by us would result in the immediate write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
finally  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be harmed 
we often purchase mortgage backed securities that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we must pay a premium over par value to acquire these securities 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mortgage backed security 
as we receive repayments of mortgage principal  we amortize the premium balances as a reduction to our income 
if the mortgage loans underlying a mortgage backed security are prepaid at a faster rate than we anticipate  we would have to amortize the premium at a faster rate 
this would reduce our income 
at december   unamortized mortgage premium balances of mortgage backed securities for financial accounting purposes were million  or of total assets 
tabular presentation the information presented in the table below projects the impact of changes in interest rates on our projected net income and net assets as more fully discussed below based on investments in place on december   and includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we acquire interest rate sensitive assets and fund them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we generally plan to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
the table below includes information about the possible future repayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities and constitutes a forward looking statement 
this information is based on many assumptions and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as assumed or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions  calls and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
the table quantifies the potential changes in our net income should interest rates go up or down shocked by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
when interest rates are shocked  these prepayment assumptions are further adjusted based on our best estimate of the effects of changes on interest rates or prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
change in percentage change percentage change interest rate in net income in net assets recently issued accounting pronouncements in june and august  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  respectively 
statement no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
statement no 
establishes a single accounting model for the accounting of a discontinued segment of a business as well as addresses significant implementation issues related to statement we do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
with the adoption of statement  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
similarly  goodwill associated with equity method investments is no longer amortized 
equity method goodwill is not  however  subject to the new impairment rules  the impairment guidance in existing rules for equity method investments continues to apply 
we do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we currently do not have any business combinations in progress  however  our board of directors has formed a special committee to consider a merger with our management company pursuant to an option agreement described more fully in item above
