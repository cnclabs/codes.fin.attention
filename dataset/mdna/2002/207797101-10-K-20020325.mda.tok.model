item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition overview connecticut water service  inc the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its ten wholly owned subsidiary companies 
approximately of the company s earnings  excluding one time acquisition costs  are attributable to the company s regulated water companies the connecticut water company  the gallup water service  incorporated  the crystal water company of danielson and the barnstable water company 
these four companies supply water to  customers in towns throughout connecticut and massachusetts 
each of these companies is subject to state regulation regarding financial issues  rates  and operating issues  and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
in addition to its regulated utilities  the company owns six unregulated companies chester realty  inc  a real estate company in connecticut  connecticut water utility services  inc  which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services  connecticut water emergency services  inc  a provider of drinking and pool water by tanker truck  crystal water utilities corporation  a holding company which owns the crystal water company of danielson and three small rental properties  barlaco  a real estate company in massachusetts  and barnstable holding company  a holding company which owns the barnstable water company and barlaco 
these unregulated companies currently generate of the company s total earnings 
was the company s th consecutive year of increased earnings and its nd consecutive year of increased dividend payments  excluding dividends paid by companies subsequently acquired and accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
regulatory matters and inflation the connecticut water company is the company s largest subsidiary serving over  of the company s  utility customers 
connecticut water company s revenues  like the company s other three regulated water companies  are based on regulated rates that are determined in a regulatory rate proceeding 
connecticut water s last general rate proceeding was in the resulting rate decision granted connecticut water a allowed return on common equity and a allowed return on rate base 
the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand its service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
the ability of the company s water utility subsidiaries to recover this increased investment in facilities is primarily dependent upon future rate increases  which are subject to state regulatory approval 
we do not presently plan to request rate relief for any of our regulated companies 
future economic and financial market conditions  coupled with governmental regulations and fiscal policy  plus other factors that are unpredictable and often beyond our control  will influence when we request revisions to rates charged to our customers 
the company is also subject to environmental and water quality regulations 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
we are currently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
outlook the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
our water companies are currently under a water supply watch due to the unusually dry weather conditions in the fall of and this winter 
as a result of these unusually dry conditions  water levels in many of the companies reservoirs and groundwater wells remain below their normal levels for this time of year 
while this is not a problem now  an extended dry period could lead to increased concerns and restricted water use this spring or summer 
after the terrorist strikes on september   water companies have had to increase security on their water supplies and facilities 
this is resulting in increases in operating and capital costs 
these costs are typically recoverable in a rate proceeding 
the company has received regulatory approval to donate certain parcels of its land in the period to over the three year period these donations are expected to increase net earnings by approximately  as a result of favorable tax treatment under federal and connecticut tax laws 
in february  the company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase of the outstanding common stock of unionville water company in exchange for million of our company s common stock 
the unionville water company is located in farmington  connecticut 
it has over  customers and annual revenues of approximately million 
the completion of the transaction is subject to approvals by the connecticut department of public utility control and unionville s shareholders and the satisfaction of other conditions

this donation resulted in a net after tax gain of  resulting from a connecticut state income tax credit in addition to state and federal charitable contribution tax deductions 
net non water sales earnings increased  or primarily as a result of increased earnings from our unregulated activities 
a substantial amount of the increase is due to our linebacker r maintenance service program

as of december  approximately  of the company s customers are protected by linebacker r

higher operating revenues partially offset the increase in operating expenses

utility operating income decreased  operating revenues decreased  or in as compared to this decrease was due to fluctuations in the summer weather  which directly affects our customers water usage 
the summer was unusually hot and dry while the summer was cool and rainy 
lower operation and maintenance expense partially offset the decrease in operating revenues

income taxes classified as operating expenses decreased  partially due to the decreased operating income 
depreciation and taxes other than income taxes primarily property taxes increased in total by  primarily as a result of the increased investment in utility plant 
interest and debt expense increased  the increase in interest and debt expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on interim debt 
the average weighted cost of this debt was in as compared with in liquidity and capital resources interim bank loans payable at year end was   higher than at the end of we consider the current  line of credit with two banks adequate to finance any expected short term borrowing requirements that may arise from operations during the lines of credit expire in april and may of we expect both lines of credit to be renewed 
interest expense charged on interim bank loans will fluctuate based on financial market conditions 
the board of directors has approved a  construction budget for  net of amounts to be financed by customer advances and contributions in aid of construction 
funds provided by operating activities are expected to finance this entire construction program given normal weather patterns and related operating revenue billings

forward looking information this report  including management s discussion and analysis  contains certain forward looking statements regarding the company s results of operations and financial position 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations  and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from expected results 
our water companies are subject to various federal and state regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
generally  the water industry is materially dependent on the adequacy of approved rates to allow for a fair rate of return on the investment in utility plant 
the ability to maintain our operating costs at the lowest possible level while providing good quality water service is beneficial to customers and stockholders 
profitability is also dependent on the timeliness of rate relief  when necessary  and numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as the quantity of rainfall and temperature  industrial demand  financing costs  energy rates  and compliance with environmental and water quality regulations
