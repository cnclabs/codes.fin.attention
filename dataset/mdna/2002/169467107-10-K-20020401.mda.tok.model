in the company  continuing its loan program efforts  was able to arrange a commercial bank financing for a total of approximately million for its customers in china  although only slightly more than half of this total was able to be shipped in due to approval delays for one major customer in china 
the remainder is expected to ship in the first part of in  the company s net income suffered a decrease of from the prior year  as discussed in more detail below 
during the year the company expanded its beijing united hospital bju by adding a hour emergency room as well as completing additional expansion of the first floor of the hospital

this restructuring entailed the creation of three subsidiaries in the republic of mauritius  one in the british virgin islands bvi  and one in china 
in the new structure  for us federal income tax purposes  the wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in china are treated as divisions or branches of an offshore holding company located in the bvi 
the chinese subsidiaries are in the process of being transferred to the ownership of a mauritius company  which is also treated as a division of bvi for us federal income tax purposes 
fiscal year compared to the company s revenues for were  up from revenues of  these numbers include bulk medical equipment sales of  in and  in  due to sales attributable to shipments made under the company s loan financing transactions 
the company believes that this type of financing is important to its customers and the company and will continue to try to offer such financings in the future 
these financings can be very complex and their impact and timing on the company s results are difficult to predict see 
timing of revenues 
in fact  the timing of the financing arranged in  was such that only half of the goods were shipped and recognized as revenue in for reasons beyond the company s control 
the company recorded net income in of  or a decrease from net income of  had the complete loan project shipped in  as planned  the company s net income would likely have exceeded that of healthcare products the healthcare products segment  consisting of medical equipment  medical consumables and personal healthcare products  had revenue growth of to  in from revenues of  the revenues included  in sales of medical equipment and  in sales of medical consumables and personal healthcare products

gross profit in rose to  from  in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the healthcare products segment declined in to from in this decrease in gross profit is related to the increase in local currency sales of medical consumables and personal healthcare products since these sales are made at a lower average gross profit than us dollar capital equipment sales 
expenses for the healthcare products segment in increased to  of revenue from  in of revenue 
salaries increased  salaries were of revenue in and in  primarily due to increased hires 
in addition  travel and entertainment expense increased  travel and entertainment was of revenue in and in as a result of increased marketing efforts and other costs increased  healthcare services the healthcare services segment consists of a western style primary care hospital and outpatient facility 
in  the revenues from this segment increased to  or over revenues of  during  the hospital has continued the expansion of its service offerings and the revenue increases for the year reflect increased patient visits taking advantage of these services 
healthcare services costs increased in to  or over costs of  this increase is due to the costs associated with increases in services

liquidity and capital resources 
other income other than interest increased slightly in to  from  in this other income is primarily from the net sublease income 
this sublease ended december  and this part of the building is now being renovated as part of the hospital expansion 
the company does not anticipate any significant revenue in this category in taxes the company has undertaken a global restructuring in which it has reorganized its structure and is modifying inter company relationships to better accommodate its predominantly chinese operations 
this restructuring was motivated  in part  by the company s desire to incorporate various functions previously operated as a division or branch of the us parent and  in part  due to its intent to expand its presence in the direct health care market by opening an additional hospital 
this restructuring provides the flexibility to structure operations in the people s republic of china to comply with the various legal and regulatory restrictions and encourages cash flow among the foreign subsidiaries to new investments without triggering us federal income tax 
this flexibility further permits the company to aggressively pursue chinese and other tax incentives  rebates  and holidays without triggering us federal income tax 
in addition  the new legal structure creates a desirable environment should the company wish to attract third party investment in a new chinese hospital or the chinese hospitals as a whole 
as such  this reorganization aligns the us tax result with the company s overall business plan and facilitates the free flow of cash among the company s foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of this restructuring the company expects to make use of a portion of its us federal net operating losses and accordingly  recorded a  deferred tax valuation adjustment on previously fully reserved tax losses 
the company expects these net operating losses to be recognizable in or fiscal year compared to the company s revenues for were  up from revenues of  the largest single component in and was  and  respectively  due to sales attributable to shipments made under the company s loan financing transactions

the following table sets forth the company s contractual cash obligations at december  total thereafter line of credit operating leases total contractual cash obligations for information about these contractual cash obligations  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
timing of revenues the timing of the company s revenues is affected by several significant factors 
many end users of the capital equipment products sold by the company depend to a certain extent upon the allocation of funds in the budgeting processes of the chinese government and the availability of credit from the chinese banking system 
these processes and the availability of credit are based on policy determinations by the chinese government and are not necessarily subject to fixed time schedules 
in addition  the sales of certain products often require protracted sales efforts  long lead times and other time consuming steps 
further  in light of the dependence by purchasers of capital equipment on the availability of credit  the timing of sales may depend upon the timing of the company s or its purchasers abilities to arrange for credit sources  including ex im bank or other loan financing 
as a result  the company s operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period and year to year 
in addition  a relatively limited number of orders and shipments may constitute a meaningful percentage of the company s revenue in any one period 
as a result  a relatively small reduction in the number of orders can have a material impact on the company s revenues in any year 
further  because the company recognizes revenues and expenses as products are shipped  the timing of shipments could affect the company s operating results for a particular period 
at the same time  a g rowing percentage of the company s revenues are attributable to hospital services and local currency sales through the products distribution division  both of which have more even revenue streams 
foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
since the company sells goods and services in local chinese currency as well as us dollars  the company has some foreign currency risk 
changes in the valuation of the chinese renminbi or hong kong dollar may have an impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company s subsidiaries  chindex tianjin  chindex shanghai and beijing united  sell products and services in renminbi 
also  the company has purchased and will continue to purchase some products in western currencies other than us dollars and has sold and will continue to sell such products in china for us dollars 
to the extent that the value of the us dollar declines against such a currency  the company could experience a negative impact on profitability 
the company anticipates hedging transactions wherever possible to minimize such negative impacts 
currently there are no such hedges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about material risk market risks the company is exposed to market risks in a variety of ways 
the principal market risk has to do with the nature of the chinese economy and political system 
since the company generates all of its revenues from china  any risk having to do with the environment in china for a foreign business operating there can have a significant impact on the company 
the chindex growth plan includes continuing expansion of the capital medical equipment and instrumentation business  rapid expansion of the products distribution product portfolio  with an emphasis on increasing the number and variety of products that are sold directly to retail pharmacies  and the development of a network of private family hospitals  based on the beijing united family hospital model  to serve china s growing middle class 
management continues to develop this growth plan  the implementation of which will be contingent on a number of factors  including requisite financing 
although the company remains optimistic about the marketplace  there are some continuing uncertainties as to the direction of china s on going political and economic reforms  the possibility for future devaluation of the chinese or hong kong currencies  as well as china s relationship with the united states 
these uncertainties may influence the budgeting and purchasing process in china 
any of the foregoing circumstances may impede trade with china  thus impairing the ability of the company s customers to purchase the company s products 
in the company s view  china s entry into the world trade organization wto in has made the dangers from these uncertainties less significant 
other possibly adverse circumstances include decreased funds available to chinese end users as a result of a general economic slowdown and increased competition from other american and european companies 
internal political risk the company s interests may be adversely affected by the political environment in china 
china is a socialist state which since has been  and is expected to continue to be  controlled by the communist party of china 
changes in the top political leadership of the chinese government and or the communist party  may have a significant impact on policy and the political and economic environment in china 
moreover  economic reforms and growth have been more successful in certain sections of the country than others  and the continuation or increase of such disparities could affect political or social stability 
government control over economy the government of china has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every section of the chinese economy through regulation and state ownership 
china s continued commitment to reform and the development of a vital private sector in that country have  to some extent  limited the practical effects of the control currently exercised by the government over individual business enterprises 
however  the economy continues to be subject to significant government controls which  if directed towards business activities of the company could have a significant adverse impact on the company 
for example  if the government were to limit the number of foreign personnel who could work in the country or were to substantially increase taxes on foreign businesses or were to impose any number of other possible types of limitations on the company s operations the impact would be significantly adverse 
legal system china s legal system is a civil law system  which is based on written statutes and in which decided legal cases have little precedential value 
moreover  china s legal system is still in the early stage of development and there are not sufficient numbers of trained judges or other legal professionals to manage disputes that may arise 
as a result  the administration of laws and regulations by government agencies in china may be subject to considerable discretion 
foreign trade corporations in the sale of its capital equipment to china  the company must make most of its sales through foreign trade corporations ftcs 
although purchasing decisions are made by the end user  which is obligated to pay the applicable purchase prices  the company enters into a formal purchase contract with only the ftc 
by virtue of its direct contractual relationship with the ftc  rather than the end user  the company is to some extent dependent upon the continuing existence of and contractual compliance by the ftc until the particular transaction has been completed 
financing for shanghai hospital the company has made commitments for the lease of the building for its shanghai hospital 
fulfillment of this commitment is dependent upon the company locating a source of financing for the hospital 
the company believes that arranging the financing will be accomplished within early however  should this prove not to be the case  the company will have the risk associated with renegotiation of its lease commitments in shanghai 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of the company s accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition on long term service contracts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long term assets  income tax recognition of deferred tax items and accruals for loss contracts and contingencies 
our policy and related procedures for revenue recognition on long term service contracts are summarized below 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales and most commissions are recognized upon product shipment 
costs associated with shipping  handling  installation  after sale servicing and warranty are not significant and are recognized in cost of sales as they are incurred 
revenues related to services provided by beijing united family hospital are recognized in the period services are provided 
costs associated with such services are recognized in the period incurred
