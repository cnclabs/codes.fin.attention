critical accounting policies briggs stratton s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such difference may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable  as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to customer rebates  pension obligations  warranty  product liability  group health insurance and taxation 
various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some instances actuarial techniques 
briggs stratton reevaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances change 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from our estimates
