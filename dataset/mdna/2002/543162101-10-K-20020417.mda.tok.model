item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales fiscal sales thousands    sales growth same store sales growth new stores closed stores sales growth impact of rd week on sales growth impact of rxamerica on sales growth pharmacy sales growth same store pharmacy sales growth pharmacy as a of total drug store sales of pharmacy sales reimbursed by third party health plans front end sales growth same store front end sales growth decline front end as a of total drug store sales sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  and in fiscal over fiscal fiscal included weeks of operations compared to weeks in fiscal the rd week accounted for of the increase in sales 
same store sales  on a comparative week to week basis  increased in fiscal  and new stores accounted for an increase of 
rxamerica s net sales  measured from our acquisition of full ownership in the pbm in september  contributed the remaining of total sales growth in fiscal the increase in sales in fiscal over fiscal was due largely to the contribution from new stores  including a full year of sales from the store net acquisition in california in october incremental sales from this acquisition contributed of total sales growth in fiscal fiscal same store sales increased 
the increased usage of newer and more costly prescription drugs and the aging us population have fueled sales growth for each of the last two fiscal years 
pharmacy sales were of total drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we expect this trend to continue due to the increased usage of newer and more costly prescription drugs and the aging us population 
these factors contributed to same store pharmacy sales increases of in fiscal and in fiscal pharmacy sales reimbursed by third party health plans represented of total pharmacy sales  compared to and in the two previous fiscal years 
we expect this trend to continue due to the ongoing shift to managed care 
same store front end sales declined in fiscal and in fiscal  due to increased competition from mass merchants  national drug store chains and supermarket pharmacies  an economic slowdown  exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september   a weak holiday shopping season and a mild cold and flu season that resulted in lower over the counter drug sales 
in addition  problems with the distribution of front end merchandise related to our third party distribution center operator in california negatively impacted operations 
we terminated our agreement with our third party distribution center operator during the second quarter of fiscal gross profit fiscal gross profit thousands    lifo provision thousands    inventory write down pursuant to closure plan thousands  gross margin gross margin as a percent of sales was in fiscal  down from and in fiscal and the declining gross margin percentages reflect the increase in pharmacy sales as a percentage of total sales 
pharmacy sales have lower margins than front end sales 
in addition  pharmacy margin percentages continue to decline throughout the retail drug store industry due to the increasing percentage of pharmacy sales reimbursed by third party health plans 
third party health plans continue to reduce reimbursement levels  resulting in lower gross margins for these sales than for non third party sales 
however  despite decreases in pharmacy gross margin percentages  pharmacy gross profit in dollars has continued to rise with the growth in sales 
gross margin percentages on front end sales have remained relatively constant for the past three fiscal years 
our gross profit includes lifo provisions of million  million and million in fiscal  and  included in cost of merchandise sold 
the lifo provision fluctuates with inflation rates and inventory levels and mix 
the increase in the lifo provision in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to increased inflation rates for pharmaceutical inventories 
operating and administrative expenses fiscal operating and administrative expenses thousands   operating and administrative expenses as a percent of sales operating and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  compared to in both fiscal and the increase in fiscal was primarily due to newly opened stores  which have lower sales than our established stores 
we opened new stores in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we also experienced increased distribution expenses as we transitioned from our third party distribution center operator to self operation of our distribution centers 
operating and administrative expenses included million  million and million of goodwill amortization in fiscal  and with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets discussed further below  we will discontinue the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  and we will review goodwill for impairment annually 
provision for store closures and asset impairment in january  our board of directors approved a plan the closure plan to close stores  and we recorded a related charge of million 
we closed stores pursuant to the closure plan during the first quarter of fiscal  and we elected not to close the remaining store 
as of january   we had successfully terminated the leases and sublet or sold the properties for of the closed stores  and we are currently marketing the remaining property 
based on the results of the closure plan to date and estimated future costs to complete the plan  we recorded a benefit of million from the reduction of the related reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  consistent with previous years  we make decisions to close stores in the normal course of business 
we closed  and stores not included in the closure plan in fiscal  and during fiscal  we recorded a benefit of million from the reduction of the provision for store closures not included in the closure plan  offset by an impairment charge of million reflecting the write down of certain long lived tangible assets associated with three stores to their estimated net recoverable values 
in fiscal and  we recorded expenses of million and million  related to the closure of stores not included in the closure plan 
other items in fiscal  we recorded a net charge of million for the settlement of a lease related dispute with a landlord  partially offset by gains on the settlement of other disputes 
in fiscal we recorded a net benefit of million related to our share of a brand name litigation settlement  partially offset by the settlement of a class action lawsuit regarding the employment classification of certain employees and the resolution of a contractual dispute with a vendor 
we also recorded a loss of million reflecting our share of the loss on the partial sale of joint venture assets in fiscal rxamerica we acquired full ownership of rxamerica  our pbm segment  in the third quarter of fiscal prior to the acquisition  rxamerica was a joint venture between longs and albertson s  and its results of operations  which were reported using the equity method of accounting  were not material to us 
rxamerica accounted for million of net income per diluted share  including joint venture income recorded prior to the acquisition  in fiscal net interest expense net interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to lower average borrowings and interest rates 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to higher borrowings to finance stock repurchases and the net acquisition of stores in california 
income taxes our effective income tax rates were  and in fiscal  and we benefited in fiscal from a federal tax law change that allows us to deduct dividends paid on allocated shares held in our employee stock ownership plan 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents were million at january   compared to million at january  the increase was due to higher cash flows provided by operating activities and lower cash used in investing and financing activities as compared to fiscal rxamerica accounted for million of cash and equivalents as of january  operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  primarily due to million of net income before non cash depreciation  amortization  asset impairment  deferred income tax and stock compensation charges 
reductions in inventory levels and increases in current liabilities also had a significant positive impact on operating cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  primarily due to million of net income before non cash depreciation  amortization  deferred income tax and stock compensation charges 
operating cash flows also increased due to an increase of million in current liabilities  including the million reserve for the closure plan and increases in payables associated with the growth in the number of our stores 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  primarily due to million of net income before non cash depreciation  amortization  deferred income tax and stock compensation charges 
this amount was partially offset by increases in receivables  inventories and other current assets associated with the growth in the number of our stores 
investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal decreased from fiscal levels  which included expenditures of approximately million for e commerce and renovations of stores acquired in fiscal additionally  receipts from property disposals increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of several sale leaseback transactions 
fiscal investing activities also included million for the acquisition of the remaining of rxamerica  net of cash acquired 
fiscal capital expenditures included approximately million for the store net acquisition in california 
capital expenditures also included amounts related to the opening of  and new stores in fiscal  and we plan to open between and stores in fiscal we expect net capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately million  including million in net new store investments  million for improvements in existing stores  million for technology  million for supply chain improvements including expenditures under the supply chain program discussed further below and million for other items 
in february  the board of directors approved a program for upgrading our supply chain practices in an effort to increase efficiency and enhance profitability 
we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements under this program over the next four fiscal years 
financing cash flows net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal we obtained an additional million in privately placed debt financing in the third quarter  offset by million in repayments of long term and short term borrowings and dividends of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting net stock repurchases of million and dividends of million  offset by million of long term and short term borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  including million in proceeds from privately placed debt financing and million in other net borrowings  primarily for the store net acquisition in california  offset by dividends of million 
in october  we replaced our million unsecured revolving line of credit with an amended and restated million unsecured revolving line of credit  which expires in october and accrues interest at libor based rates 
borrowings on the line of credit do not require repayment until the expiration date 
as of january   million was outstanding under this line of credit with a weighted average interest rate of 
additionally  as of january   we have million in privately placed promissory notes  including million completed in the third quarter of fiscal these notes mature at various dates through and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
we used the proceeds from the million private placement borrowing in fiscal to pay down the revolving line of credit and to provide cash funding for the acquisition of the remaining of rxamerica 
our note payable to rxamerica was eliminated upon acquisition of full ownership of the pbm subsidiary 
our debt agreements contain limits on borrowings  dividend payments and repurchases of company stock  and various quarterly financial covenants that set maximum leverage ratios and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios 
the agreements allowed for the exclusion of the million charge associated with the closure plan in the computation of the fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of january   we were in compliance with the restrictions and limitations included in these provisions 
in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock through november  for a maximum total expenditure of million 
during fiscal  we purchased  shares under this authorization at a total cost of million 
we also repurchased  shares of common stock from the estate of vera m 
long at a total cost of million pursuant to a separate authorization by the board of directors in february in addition  we sold  shares of common stock back to the profit sharing plan in fiscal for million  resulting in net stock repurchases of million 
we believe that cash on hand  together with cash provided by operating activities and borrowings on our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by fiscal year thereafter total thousands long term debt      capital lease obligations  operating leases      totals       we utilize normal operating leases for many of our store locations  but we do not engage in lease financing of a special purpose entity nature 
in addition  we had the following commercial commitments as of january  amount of commitment expiration by fiscal year thereafter total thousands lines of credit unused portion  letters of credit   surety bonds   totals    our surety bonds secure obligations related to workers compensation claims and will continue to be renewed as long as the related payment obligations are in effect 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related expected future cash flows 
in fiscal  we identified three stores with a history of operating and cash flow losses combined with projections of continuing losses in the foreseeable future 
our projections indicate that the carrying values of certain long lived tangible assets associated with these stores will not be recovered through future cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write such assets down to their estimated fair values  based on discounted projected future cash flows 
store closure reserves we record the estimated costs associated with closing a store during the period in which the store is identified and approved by management under a plan of termination  which includes the method of disposition and the expected date of completion 
these costs include amounts that we are contractually obligated to pay during the remainder of the lease  net of any expected sublease income  and the difference between the carrying values and estimated recoverable values of long lived tangible and intangible assets 
we record severance and other employee related costs in the period in which the closure and related severance packages are communicated to the affected employees 
we record losses on the liquidation of inventories in cost of merchandise sold when the inventories are sold or otherwise disposed of 
we evaluate our store closure reserves and adjust them accordingly based on the estimated future costs to complete the store closures 
new accounting pronouncements in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we have no derivative instruments  and therefore adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but must be tested annually for impairment 
we will adopt sfas no 
and sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will discontinue the amortization of goodwill with a carrying value of million as of january  and annual amortization of approximately million 
as required by sfas no 
 we have performed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of february   the date of adoption of the standard 
based on an independent valuation  we have identified certain regional reporting units that have experienced declines in their fair values below their net carrying values 
accordingly  we will recognize a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million approximately million after tax for these reporting units in the first quarter of fiscal as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the year  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 which addresses the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs  is effective for us beginning in fiscal sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and is effective for us beginning in fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
or sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully read the following risk factors 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional  and national companies  including other drug store chains  independent drug stores  on line retailers  supermarket chains and mass merchandisers 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  including name recognition and capital resources  than we do 
as competition increases in the markets in which we operate  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur  which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services at reduced prices to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in our markets or increase our sales volume or margins in response to further increased competition 
our ability to successfully implement supply chain improvements and other strategic initiatives is critical to the ongoing success of our business 
in february  our board of directors approved a program to upgrade our supply chain practices in an effort to increase efficiency and enhance profitability  along with initiatives to increase front end sales and pharmacy margins  enhance customer service and improve operational efficiencies 
we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements under this program over the next four fiscal years 
the success of these initiatives is important to our future profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute these initiatives successfully 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs continue to reduce our margins on pharmacy sales and could have a material adverse effect on our overall performance 
we are reimbursed by third party health plans for approximately of all the prescription drugs that we sell  and this percentage has continued to increase 
pharmacy sales to third parties have lower gross margins than non third party pharmacy sales 
third party health plans continue to reduce the levels at which they reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  if medicare is reformed to include prescription benefits  medicare may cover some of the prescription drugs that we now sell at retail prices  and we may be reimbursed at prices lower than our current retail prices 
if third party health plans continue to reduce their reimbursement levels  or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices  our margins on these sales will continue to be reduced  and our profitability will be adversely affected 
the transition from third party distribution to self distribution could result in increased costs 
we terminated our agreement with our third party distribution center operator in california during the second quarter of fiscal we incurred additional costs during the third and fourth quarters as we continued to transition the operation of the distribution centers  and these costs could continue to adversely affect net income in the near future 
a continued economic slowdown could adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  which are our higher margin products 
the economy began showing signs of slowing in fiscal the terrorist attacks on september  adversely affected sales for that week and have had a continuing negative impact on tourism 
we operate stores in the state of hawaii  which have been adversely impacted by the decline in tourism 
if the economy continues to slow and unemployment increases or inflationary conditions worry consumers  they may decrease their purchases  particularly of products other than pharmaceutical products that they need for health reasons 
we make a higher profit on our sales of front end products than we do on sales of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  any decrease in our sales of front end products will decrease our profitability 
our ability to attract and retain pharmacy personnel or develop alternate fill sources is important to the continued success or our business 
our industry is experiencing a shortage of licensed pharmacists in the markets in which we operate 
our inability to attract and retain pharmacists and other key personnel could adversely affect us 
in response to the pharmacist shortage we recently entered into a joint venture agreement with amerisourcebergen to operate a central prescription fill center 
the success of this fill center is important to our ability to address the shortage of pharmacists 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms  a disruption in our relationship with this supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we obtain approximately of our total merchandise  including of our pharmaceutical supplies  from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  pursuant to a long term supply contract 
any significant disruptions in our relationships with amerisourcebergen could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or their significant change could have a material adverse effect on us 
our pharmacy business is subject to numerous federal  state and local regulations 
these include local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations  prohibitions against paid referrals of patients and protection of confidential patient medical records and information 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties 
furthermore  federal and state reform programs  such as healthcare reform initiatives  could adversely affect our pharmacies  and any new federal or state programs could also adversely affect us 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
the energy crisis in the state of california may result in increased operating and administrative expenses in fiscal as of january   we operated stores in the state of california  which has experienced energy shortages causing some power outages 
california utility companies announced significant increases in energy rates  which were reflected in utility bills received beginning in the third quarter of fiscal these shortages may expand to other markets in which we operate 
we have taken such steps as reducing store lighting  raising store temperatures and disconnecting unused electrical equipment to conserve energy  but the volatility of energy rates has resulted in increased operating and administrative expenses and our energy related expenses may continue to increase in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
we use debt financing in combination with operating cash flows to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
a portion of our debt bears interest at libor based rates  and therefore an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we have not purchased and do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
a change in interest rates basis points on our floating rate debt as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our earnings and cash flows and on the fair value of our fixed rate debt
