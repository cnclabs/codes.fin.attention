item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding our strategy  financial performance and revenue sources 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in this item  and under item business additional factors that may affect results of operations  beginning at page  above  and elsewhere in this form k 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
on january   we merged with telcom and accounted for the merger as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the operations of telcom for all periods presented 
telcom had a december fiscal year end  thus the consolidated financial statements presented for march   and have been combined with the operations of telcom as of and for the years ended december   and we have conformed the telcom financial data to a march year end for the march  fiscal year 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative 
special charges operating income net sales we have one operating industry segment and engage primarily in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products 
we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of market segments  perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 
our net sales of million in fiscal decreased by million  or  over fiscal  and net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from slowing demand from end markets  and to a lesser extent from inventory corrections at our customers  overall semiconductor industry conditions and serial eeprom pricing declines 
we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years 
our sales increases prior to fiscal can be attributed to several factors including new product introductions strong demand for new and existing products which address our customers requirements  and focused technical resources that assist our customers in successfully bringing their products to market 
our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales 
microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our microcontroller products decreased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales of our microcontroller products was significantly lower than the decrease in our other product lines due to our continuing design win performance and the overall positioning of our proprietary product offerings 
net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal  driven by increased end market demand  our continued design win performance and increases in our overall market share 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product 
the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines  due primarily to competitive conditions 
we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices 
sales of our serial eeprom products accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our serial eeprom products decreased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal  driven by over supply in the market and significant pricing pressures 
net sales of our serial eeprom products increased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal driven primarily by customers real and perceived supply and demand conditions within the market 
serial eeprom product pricing responds to changes in supply and demand factors over time  being more commodity than proprietary in nature 
during the periods covered by this report  we have experienced various serial eeprom product pricing trends due to market conditions 
in fiscal  serial eeprom product pricing trends showed modest declines  while in fiscal  pricing actually increased due to supply constraints 
however  we experienced significant competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom product lines during the first half of fiscal returning to modest pricing declines in the second half of fiscal we anticipate serial eeprom pricing to be flat to up in the first quarter of fiscal sales of mixed signal analog and interface products accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our analog and interface products decreased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales of our analog and interface products can be attributed to decreased demand  primarily in the telecommunications market 
net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal driven by customers real and perceived supply and demand conditions within the market 
analog and interface products can be proprietary or non proprietary in nature 
currently  we consider approximately of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature  where prices are relatively stable  similar to the pricing stability of our microcontroller products 
the non proprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations  driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products  similar to the pricing pressures experienced in our serial eeprom product lines 
during fiscal  our analog and interface products experienced price reductions of approximately 
the price decreases experienced in fiscal can be attributed to the supply and demand environment as well as the integration of the telcom products into our pricing structure 
we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products to increase over time 
we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller or other products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which would adversely affect our operating results 
sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows in thousands year ended march  microcontrollers    serial eeprom products    analog and interface products    total sales    our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter  which we refer to as turns orders  and shipments from backlog 
we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the revenue target that we set entering the quarter 
we emphasize our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy  resulting in customers placing orders with short delivery schedules 
turns orders directly correlate with product lead times  which are currently between two and four weeks generally  essentially unchanged from lead times a year ago 
shorter lead times have the effect of increasing turns orders as a percentage of our business in any given quarter and reducing our visibility on future product shipments 
with current lead times between two and four weeks  customers do not place orders beyond their immediate requirements and therefore  we do not currently have the order visibility we experienced throughout fiscal the percentage of turns orders in any given quarter is dependent on overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times 
as such  our percentage of turns orders has fluctuated over the last three fiscal years between approximately and 
at april   we required turns orders of approximately in order to achieve our revenue target for the first quarter of fiscal at january   we required turns orders of approximately to achieve our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal turns orders are difficult to predict  and we may not experience the combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in any particular quarter that would be sufficient to achieve anticipated net sales 
if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our projections  our revenue and operating results will suffer 
the foregoing statements regarding average selling prices  pricing pressures in certain microcontroller product lines  pricing fluctuations in our non proprietary analog and interface products lines  the increase in the portion of our analog and interface product line that is proprietary  pricing increases for serial eeprom products in the first quarter of fiscal and the level of turns orders required to meet our revenue target for the first quarter of fiscal  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  demand for our products and the products of our customers  our inventory mix and timing of customer orders  customers inventory levels  order patterns and seasonality  the level at which our design wins become actual orders and sales  competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability  possible disruption in commercial activities occasioned by terrorist activity and armed conflict  which could result in changes in logistics and security arrangements  and reduced customer purchases relative to expectations  impact of events outside the united states  such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  changes in product mix  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other fixed manufacturing costs  competitive factors  such as competing architectures and manufacturing technologies and acceptance of new products in the markets we generally serve  and general industry  economic and political conditions 
distributors accounted for of our net sales in fiscal  of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal our largest distributor accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal generally  we do not have long term agreements with our distributors and our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice 
the loss of  or the disruption in the operations of  one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in product returns 
at march   distributors were maintaining an average of months of inventory of our products 
over the past three fiscal years  the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately and months 
we believe that distributor inventory levels are at or near replenishment levels and that the dollar value and average months of distributor inventory will increase in future periods as our business returns to a pattern of growth 
the foregoing statements regarding distributors inventory levels being at or near replenishment levels  the dollar value and average months of distributor inventory increasing in future periods and our business returning to a pattern of growth are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others inventory levels at our distributors and at the customers of our distributors  demand for our products and the products of our customers  the level at which our design wins become actual orders and sales  our inventory mix and timing of customer orders  order patterns and seasonality  competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability  possible disruption in commercial activities occasioned by terrorist activity and armed conflict  which could result in changes in logistics and security arrangements  and reduced customer purchases relative to expectations  impact of events outside the united states  such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers  competitive factors  such as competing architectures and manufacturing technologies and acceptance of new products in the markets we generally serve  and general industry  economic and political conditions 
sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows in thousands year ended march  americas    europe    asia    total sales    our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe  which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive  communications  computing  consumer and industrial control products 
americas sales include sales to customers in the united states  canada  central america and south america 
sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately of our net sales in each of fiscal and fiscal the majority of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 
we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years  there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future 
at march   we had no significant foreign currency contracts outstanding 
gross profit our gross profit was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were reduced levels of manufacturing capacity utilization in fiscal compared to the previous two fiscal years continued cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing in all periods covered by this report maintenance of average selling prices for our microcontroller products where moderate pricing pressures were significantly offset by new product introductions with more features and higher selling prices in all periods covered by this report significant competitive pricing pressures in serial eeprom products in the first half of fiscal returning to a pattern of more moderate prices declines in the second half of fiscal  as discussed at page pricing increases in serial eeprom products during fiscal modest pricing declines in serial eeprom products during fiscal fluctuations in the product mix of microcontroller and analog products and related serial eeprom products as illustrated in the chart in net sales on page  and cost reductions associated with one week plant shutdowns in each of the first three quarters of fiscal by march   we reduced cumulative wafer capacity at fab and fab by approximately  compared to our december  levels  in response to business conditions that resulted in decreased product demand 
during fiscal  fab and fab operated at approximately of their capacity due to the capacity reductions implemented in the march quarter and a one week plant shutdown in each quarter of fiscal beginning with the march quarter  our overall gross margins have been negatively impacted by these actions due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in our wafer fabrication manufacturing  which continue even at lower capacity levels 
we expect capacity utilization in the first quarter of fiscal to be approximately 
we are taking the necessary actions to increase our capacity utilization by increasing variable spending such as direct labor and raw materials costs  and selectively placing orders for longer lead time manufacturing equipment needed to achieve our projected manufacturing outputs 
overall inventory levels have declined from million as of march  to million as of march   confirming that capacity was reduced to a level aligned with market demand 
we maintained days of inventory on our balance sheet as of march   compared to days as of march  the highest number of days of inventory that we had experienced for the period covered by this report was days as of september  fab is currently being maintained at minimal operating cost until we expect to require its capacity for production 
we currently plan to utilize fab for our future production requirements 
however  as we begin to plan for the mobilization of fab  we continue to explore other  potentially more cost effective  alternatives that may become available to meet our future production requirements 
when required for production  fab will produce inch wafers 
upon commencement of operations at fab  our operating margins could suffer as production is brought on line and depreciation on the buildings and related equipment commences 
fabs and currently utilize various manufacturing process technologies  but predominantly utilize our to micron processes 
we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs 
in fiscal  approximately of our production was on inch wafers 
in fiscal  products produced on inch wafers increased from approximately at the beginning of fiscal to approximately at the end of fiscal we anticipate that gross margins will fluctuate over time  driven primarily by the product mix of microcontroller products and related memory products  manufacturing yields  fixed cost absorption  wafer fab loading levels and competitive and economic conditions 
the foregoing statements relating to our expected capacity utilization in the first quarter of fiscal  confirmation that our capacity reduction actions have aligned capacity with market demand  our continuing exploration of alternatives to meet our future production requirements  the transition to higher yielding manufacturing processes to reduce future operating costs and the fluctuation of gross margins over time are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others demand for our products  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other direct manufacturing costs  competition and competitive pressure on pricing  possible disruption in commercial activities occasioned by terrorist activity and armed conflict  which could result in changes in logistics and security arrangements  and reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  impact of events outside the united states  such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability  our ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed  cost and availability of raw materials  changes in product mix  and other industry and economic conditions 
at march   approximately of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility  compared to approximately as of march  third party contractors located throughout asia perform the balance of our assembly operations 
substantially all of our test requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march   compared to approximately as of march  we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to third party contractor assembly and test costs  as well as increased control of these portions of the manufacturing process 
our reliance on third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract 
while we review the quality  delivery and cost performance of our third party contractors  our future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields  assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 
our reliance on foreign operations  maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations  and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  including political  social and economic instability trade restrictions and changes in tariffs import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing international operations employment regulations disruptions in international transport or delivery fluctuations in currency exchange rates difficulties in collecting receivables economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to date  we have not experienced any significant interruptions in our foreign business operations 
if any of these risks materialize  our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 
research and development r d r d expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales fiscal and million  or of sales for fiscal we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products  including development systems  and in our design and manufacturing process technologies 
we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position 
we expense all r d costs as incurred 
r d expenses include expenditures for labor  masks  prototype wafers  and expenses for the development of process technologies  new packages  and software to support new products and design environments 
r d expenses increased million  or for fiscal over fiscal r d expenses increased million  or for fiscal over fiscal the primary reason for the dollar increase in r d costs in fiscal over fiscal and fiscal was increased labor and professional service costs associated with expanding our technical resources 
r d expenses would have increased more in fiscal if we had not implemented unpaid one week plant shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for fiscal and million  or of sales for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales  marketing and administrative personnel  advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales and support centers worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the use and proper selection of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reason for the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal over fiscal relate to reductions in wages  bonuses and recruitment costs and unpaid one week plant shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reason for the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal over fiscal was the labor and recruitment costs associated with expanding our employment base to support the growth of our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time  primarily due to revenue and operating expense levels 
special charges there were no special charges in fiscal the following table presents a summary of special charges for the fiscal years ended march  and year ended march  in thousands restructuring charges  telcom merger charges  intellectual property settlement  legal charges  totals   fiscal during the march quarter  we implemented capacity and cost reduction actions necessitated by the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
we reduced cumulative wafer fab capacity at fabs and by approximately  compared to our december  levels 
we also decided to close our hong kong test facility  acquired as part of the telcom transaction  and migrate these test requirements to our thailand test facility 
the capacity reduction at fabs and was completed by the end of the march quarter 
the closure of the hong kong facility was completed by june  these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of million in the march quarter 
these actions were undertaken to reduce both manufacturing capacity and manufacturing costs 
the reduction in wafer fab capacity was required due to reduced customer demand 
the closure of the hong kong facility was undertaken to rationalize our test manufacturing capacity and migrate the test requirements to our more cost effective test facility in thailand 
included in the restructuring charges resulting from these actions was million related to equipment that was written off million related to employee severance costs  and million related to other restructuring costs 
on january   we completed our merger with telcom 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we exchanged each share of telcom common stock for of a share of microchip common stock 
we issued  shares of our common stock and assumed all outstanding telcom stock options 
the transaction was structured as a tax free reorganization and is being accounted for as a pooling of interests 
during the march quarter  we recognized a special charge of million for costs associated with the telcom transaction 
these costs included million associated with investment banking fees million associated with legal and accounting fees million of severance costs  and million related to other costs 
all reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal actions have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously provided amounts 
fiscal telcom recorded restructuring charges in its quarter ended march  of million  primarily for employee severance costs 
these charges have been reflected in our fiscal operating results 
all restructuring reserves relating to these charges have been fully utilized 
legal settlement with lucent technologies inc 
on january   we finalized a settlement of patent litigation with lucent technologies inc resulting in a  special charge during the quarter ended december  under the terms of the settlement  we made one time cash payment to lucent and issued to lucent a warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock at per share 
we originally assigned a value of million to the warrant and recorded the amount in accrued liabilities 
the warrant was exercised by the holder in fiscal  and the million was reclassified to additional paid in capital and is now reflected in our statement of stockholders equity and other comprehensive income 
the terms of the settlement also provided for a contingent payment to lucent if our earnings per share performance for the three and one half year period ended june  did not meet certain targeted levels 
based on the estimate of earnings per share for the measurement period as of march   we provided appropriate reserves to meet this liability 
due to the sale of the warrant by the holder to a third party  the associated reserve became unnecessary and million of the special charge was reversed in the quarter ended september  we also recorded a special charge related to other legal issues in the amount of million in the quarter ended september  additionally  we recorded a special charge related to other legal issues in the amount of million in the quarter ended september  all reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal actions have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously provided amounts 
other income expense interest income in fiscal decreased from interest income in fiscal  although average invested cash balances were higher in fiscal the decrease in interest income was primarily driven by significantly lower interest rates applicable to our invested cash balances during fiscal compared to the interest rates applied during fiscal interest income in fiscal increased from fiscal as a result of higher invested cash balances due primarily to the receipt of proceeds of million from follow on public offerings completed in march provision for income taxes provisions for income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  and is lower than statutory rates in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations and r d tax credits 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily related to increased r d tax credits that were available to us 
based on our current assumptions  we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately 
the foregoing statement regarding our anticipated effective tax rate for fiscal is a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others current tax laws and regulations  taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations  the portion of total income generated in each taxing jurisdiction  and current tax holidays available in foreign locations 
euro conversion issues we operate in the european market and currently generate approximately one third of our total net sales from customers located in europe 
our commercial headquarters in europe are located in the united kingdom  which is not currently one of the member states of the european union that has converted to the euro 
we currently conduct approximately of our business in europe in us dollars and approximately of our business in europe in pounds sterling 
the balance of our net sales in europe is conducted in the euro 
we will monitor the potential commercial impact of conversion of a portion of our current business to the euro  but we do not currently anticipate any material impact to our business or operations based on this transition 
the foregoing statement regarding the anticipated impact of the transition to the euro currency is a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others levels of sales in europe that may be conducted in the euro  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
liquidity and capital resources we had million in cash and cash equivalents at march   an increase of million from the march  balance 
during the fiscal year ended march   we maintained an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks totaling million 
we can elect to increase the facility to million  subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement 
this facility terminates on may  there were no borrowings against the line of credit as of march  we are required to achieve certain financial ratios and operating results to maintain this line of credit and were in compliance with these covenants as of march  we also maintain an unsecured short term line of credit with various financial institutions in asia totaling million us dollar equivalent 
there were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march   but an allocation of million of the available line was made  related to import guarantees associated with our business in thailand 
there are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit 
at march   an aggregate of million of these facilities was available  subject to financial covenants and ratios with which we were in compliance 
our ability to fully utilize these facilities is dependent on our remaining in compliance with such covenants and ratios 
net cash provided from operating activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the principal changes in cash flow from operations during fiscal was related to decreased profitability  offset by the impact of inventory valuation provisions  changes in inventories and changes in other assets and liabilities 
our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary reason for the dollar decrease in capital expenditures from the prior year was the reduction in the level of capacity expansion activities in response to reduced demand 
capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment in each of these periods 
we currently intend to spend approximately million during the next months to invest in equipment to maintain and increase capacity at our existing wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities 
we expect to finance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations and available debt arrangements 
we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 
the foregoing statements regarding the anticipated level of capital expenditures over the next months and the financing of such capital expenditures  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  market acceptance of our products and of our customers products  demand for our products  utilization of current manufacturing capacity  the availability and cost of raw materials  equipment and other supplies  and economic  political and other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and for fiscal proceeds from the sale of stock and put options were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations were million in fiscal repayments on lines of credit were million and million for the years ended march  and cash expended for the purchase of our common stock was million in fiscal and million in fiscal in connection with a stock repurchase program  during the year ended march  we purchased a total of  shares of our common stock in open market activities at a total cost of million 
we maintained a net shares settled forward contract during the years ended march   and the table below contains a summary of the share and cash activity under this contract year ended march  in thousands shares received  shares delivered net shares received delivered  cash received    cash delivered net cash received delivered    during fiscal  we made a net delivery of  shares of our common stock 
we also received approximately million in connection with an early termination covering  of the shares outstanding under the net shares settled forward contract 
we closed out the net shares settled forward contract in its entirety on january  and made a cash payment of million to purchase the remaining  shares of our common stock outstanding under the contract 
the purchased shares were held as treasury shares and were used to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan through april  we had no off balance sheet financings at march  at march   we had contractual obligations of approximately million for the purchase or construction of property  plant and equipment 
on may   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire powersmart  inc we will pay approximately million in cash for powersmart and will assume a balance sheet with approximately million in cash and other net assets 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and will be funded by our existing cash balances 
the transaction is expected to close by june   following approval by powersmart s stockholders 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing during the next months for the capital expenditures required to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities  investments in or acquisitions of complimentary businesses  products or technologies or other purposes 
the timing and amount of any such capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  changes in industry conditions  product mix  and competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing could result in incremental dilution to existing investors 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of microchip s financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes  property plant and equipment and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems and to distributors who have no  or limited  product return rights and no price protection rights 
for sales recorded upon shipment  we record reserves to cover the estimated customer returns 
returns have historically been less than of sales 
to the extent rates of return change  our estimates for the reserves necessary to cover such returns would also change 
when distributors have broad rights to return products and price protection rights  we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to the end customer 
upon shipment  amounts billed to distributors with broad rights to return product and price protection rights are included as accounts receivable  inventory is relieved  the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which is included in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the composition of our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering such customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
write offs of customer account balances have ranged between million and million annually during the periods covered by this report 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable 
in estimating our reserves for obsolescence  we generally evaluate estimates of demand over a month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated month demand 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at march   our gross deferred tax asset was million 
numerous taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would result 
the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others results of any audit conducted by the various taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business  the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  current and future tax laws and regulations  and taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations 
property plant equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
at march   the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled million  which represents of total assets 
this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgements relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately years on buildings 
we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
fab has not been placed in service and the related depreciation of the assets at the facility has not commenced 
the lives to be used for depreciating the equipment at fab will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service 
we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or values of the underlying assets 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility resides 
the land is subject to a complex restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land 
we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title 
such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land 
however  timing of the resolution and the ultimate amount to be paid could change 
litigation our current estimated range of liability related to certain pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss  and recorded reserves were not significant at march  because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of march   and million as of march  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of march  and march   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
to date  our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if foreign currency rates fluctuate by from the rates at march  and march   the effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be material 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectability of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
