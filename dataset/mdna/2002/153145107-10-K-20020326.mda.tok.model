therefore  the information set forth therein should be carefully considered when evaluating the business prospects of the company and the bank 
critical accounting policies general central coast bancorp s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting 
statement of financial accountings standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses an historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information  and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate those losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowances 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see page business organization central coast bancorp the company is a california corporation  located in salinas  california and was organized in to act as a bank holding company for bank of salinas 
in  the company acquired cypress bank  which was headquartered in seaside  california 
both banks were state charted institutions

the following analysis is designed to enhance the reader s understanding of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for additional detailed information 
average balances  including such balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances for the company 
except within the overview section below  interest income and net interest income are presented on a tax equivalent basis 
overview for the th consecutive year  central coast bancorp earned record net income on a year over year basis 
net income in increased to  versus  in diluted earnings per share for  after giving effect to the for stock split distributed on february   was  up from the reported for for  the company realized a return on average equity of and a return on average assets of  as compared to and for during  total assets of the company increased  to a total of  at year end 
at december   loans totaled  up  from the ending balances on december  deposit growth in  which includes  of state of california certificates of deposit  was  
deposits totaled  at year end these past two years have presented very different economic conditions for the banking business 
in  interest rates were increasing with the prime rate ending the year at 
competition for deposits was strong and by december  typical rates on one year certificates of deposit exceeded 
on january   the federal reserve bank made the first of eleven rate cuts during the year  which totaled basis points resulting in a in a prime rate of at december  at each rate cut variable rate loans repriced immediately or by the quarter end 
rates paid on deposit products were lowered as market conditions allowed and generally lagged the reduction in loan rates 
the market rate for a one year certificate at december  was approximately 
however  certificates of deposit with longer average maturities will not reflect the decline in rates until they reprice at maturity 
thus  throughout as earning assets repriced more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  the net interest margin declined with a resulting downward pressure on earnings 
the increase in earning assets helped to offset the decline in yields 
while the economic conditions for the past two years were very different  our community based banking model has provided the company with continued growth in customer base  assets and earnings 
we are proud of our record of consecutive years of increased earnings  particularly in the face of the current economic and interest rate environment 
in june and october of  the bank opened new branch offices in hollister and watsonville 
both of these branches exceeded their budgeted loan and deposit targets 
the san benito chamber of commerce designated the hollister branch as the professional service business of the year 
the award is an extraordinary accomplishment for a business in its first year of operation 
we are very proud of the way in which both of these new branches have become an integral part of their respective community in such a short time 
the success of these branches reinforces our strategy of expanding the bank s footprint by opening traditional branches in communities with a similar economic base and structure to our existing markets 
as announced  the bank will open a new branch in gilroy early in we anticipate opening one additional branch later this year 
looking forward into  it appears the year will provide another challenging economic environment 
if the short term interest rates do not decrease further  we would expect the bank s net interest margin to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter rate of about 
current economic data suggests that the country will have a slow recovery 
with these factors in mind  the key for earnings growth is to continue to develop solid banking relationships  emphasize loan quality and control costs 
in this  the bank s twentieth year of operations  we expect to continue our record of continued earnings growth based on our current evaluation of economic data available to us 
a results of operations net interest income net interest margin fully taxable equivalent net interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets loans  securities and federal funds sold over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
net interest income for was  a  increase over the rapidly changing interest rates in had a significant impact on the bank s interest income and interest expense during the year 
interest income increased  to total  in the average balance of loans outstanding in was  higher than it was in this higher volume of loans contributed  to interest income from the prior year results 
the average rate received on loans decreased from in to in this decrease of basis points reduced interest income  in december of and during the first quarter of  the bank increased its holdings of tax exempt securities 
this resulted in an increase of  in interest earned on tax exempt securities in  of which   was due do higher volume and  was due to higher rates 
both the average rate and balance decreased on taxable investment securities resulting in a decrease of  in interest income 
interest earned on fed funds sold was down  due both to the volume and rates 
overall  the average rate received on earning assets in decreased basis points to from the received in interest expense was  higher in over  as the lower rates paid approximately offset the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities 
average balances of interest bearing liabilities were higher in by  which added  to interest expense 
average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities were down basis points for the year 
the lower rates reduced interest expense in by  interest paid on interest bearing liabilities generally adjusts more slowly in response to market rate changes as time deposits and borrowings adjust at maturity 
as rates continued to come down in the fourth quarter of  the average rates received on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased accordingly 
in the fourth quarter  the average rate received on earning assets was down from in the year ago period 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was versus in the fourth quarter of the net interest margin for the two periods was and  respectively 
with no further rate cuts in the first quarter of  management expects the net interest margin will be slightly lower than the achieved in the fourth quarter 
net interest income for was  a  increase over the interest income component was up  to  
about of the increase was attributable to growth in the earning assets with the balance due to rates

this increase contributed an additional  to interest income 
from july  through may   the federal reserve board raised interest rates six times for a total of basis points 
the higher interest rates increased the average yield on loans basis points  which added  to interest income 
the securities portfolio average balances decreased   which offset the increases in interest income by  the average yield received on securities was up basis points and added  to interest income 
federal funds sold interest income increased  due to both higher average balances and higher rates 
interest expense increased  in over the average balances of interest bearing liabilities increased  
the higher average balances resulted from a  increase in time deposits offset in part by an  decrease in interest bearing checking accounts 
at times during  the bank had up to  in time deposits from the state of california 
this compares to a maximum of  in interest paid on time certificates in increased  which accounted for most of the overall increase in interest expense

occupancy and fixed assets expense increased  in over the new hollister and watsonville branch offices accounted for  of the increase 
for the rest of the company  occupancy and fixed assets expense increased

b balance sheet analysis central coast bancorp s total assets at december  were  compared to  at december   representing an increase of 
the average balance of total assets was  in  which represents an increase of totaling  over the average total asset balance of  in loans the bank concentrates its lending activities in four principal areas commercial loans including agricultural loans  real estate construction loans both commercial and personal  real estate other loans and consumer loans 
at december   these four categories accounted for approximately   and of the bank s loan portfolio  respectively  as compared to   and at december  the bank has developed a very successful loan calling officer program 
on a year over year basis beginning in  the annual percentage of loan growth has been    and 
the bank has attracted many new loan customers as well as better serving existing customers 
all categories of loans reflect increased growth in the largest growth took place in the real estate other category 
however  the largest percentage gain of was in the consumer category 
a concerted effort was made in to offer a broader and more competitive package of consumer loans 
table three summarizes the composition of the loan portfolio for the past five years as of december table three loan portfolio composite in thousands commercial      real estate construction      other      consumer      deferred loans fees  total loans      allowance for loan losses      total      the majority of the bank s loans are direct loans made to individuals  local businesses and agri businesses 
the bank relies substantially on local promotional activity  personal contacts by bank officers  directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions 
the bank makes loans to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose  a viable repayment source and a plan of repayment established at inception and generally backed by a secondary source of repayment 
commercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs  loans for equipment purchases  working capital  and various other business loan products 
consumer loans include a range of traditional consumer loan products offered by the bank such as personal lines of credit and loans to finance purchases of autos  boats  recreational vehicles  mobile homes and various other consumer items 
the construction loans are generally composed of commitments to customers within the bank s service area for construction of both commercial properties and custom and semi custom single family residences 
other real estate loans consist primarily of loans to the bank s depositors secured by first trust deeds on commercial and residential properties typically with short term maturities and original loan to value ratios not exceeding 
in general  except in the case of loans with sba guarantees  the bank does not make long term mortgage loans  however  the bank has informal arrangements in place with mortgage lenders to assist customers in securing single family mortgage financing 
average net loans in were  representing an increase of  or over average net loans in were  representing an increase of  or over risk elements the bank assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through stringent credit review and approval policies  extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies 
additionally  the bank contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically grade new loans and to review the existing loan portfolio 
management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the company s loan portfolio is critical for profitability and growth 
management strives to continue the historically low level of loan losses by continuing its emphasis on credit quality in the loan approval process  active credit administration and regular monitoring 
with this in mind  management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
ultimately  the credit quality of the bank s loans may be influenced by underlying trends in the national and local economic and business cycles 
the bank s business is mostly concentrated in monterey county 
the county s economy is highly dependent on the agricultural and tourism industries 
the agricultural industry is also a major driver of the economies of san benito county and the southern portions of santa cruz and santa clara counties  which represent the areas of the bank s branch expansion plan 
as a result  the bank lends money to individuals and companies dependent upon the agricultural and tourism industries 
the company has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit which are secured by real estate  totaling approximately million at december  although management believes this real estate concentration has no more that the normal risk of collectibility  a substantial decline in the economy in general  or a decline in real estate values in the bank s primary market areas in particular  could have an adverse impact on the collectibility of these loans 
the ultimate recovery of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation  sale or refinancing of the real estate 
the bank monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectibility of real estate loans 
when  in management s judgment  these loans are impaired  an appropriate provision for losses is recorded 
the more significant assumptions management considers involve estimates of the following lease  absorption and sale rates  real estate values and rates of return  operating expenses  inflation  and sufficiency of collateral independent of the real estate including  in limited instances  personal guarantees 
not withstanding the foregoing  abnormally high rates of impairment due to general local economic conditions could adversely affect the company s future prospects and results of operations 
in extending credit and commitments to borrowers  the bank generally requires collateral and or guarantees as security 
the repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers 
the bank s requirement for collateral and or guarantees is determined on a case by case basis in connection with management s evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing properties  residences and other real property 
the bank secures its collateral by perfecting its interest in business assets  obtaining deeds of trust  or outright possession among other means 
loan losses from lending transactions related to real estate and agriculture compare favorably with the bank s loan losses on its loan portfolio as a whole 
management believes that its lending policies and underwriting standards will tend to mitigate losses in an economic downturn  however  there is no assurance that losses will not occur under such circumstances 
the bank s loan policies and underwriting standards include  but are not limited to  the following maintaining a thorough understanding of the bank s service area and limiting investments outside of this area  maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers knowledge and capacity in their field of expertise  basing real estate construction loan approval not only on salability of the project  but also on the borrowers capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not sell within the original projected time period  and maintaining conforming and prudent loan to value and loan to cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the bank s construction lending officers 
in addition  the bank strives to diversify the risk inherent in the construction portfolio by avoiding concentrations to individual borrowers and on any one project 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  collection appears unlikely 
table four sets forth nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  and restructured loans performing in compliance with modified terms  for december table four non performing loans in thousands past due days or more and still accruing commercial real estate  consumer and other nonaccrual commercial real estate  consumer and other restructured in compliance with modified terms commercial  total     interest due but excluded from interest income on nonaccrual loans was approximately  in   in and  in in and  interest income recognized from payments received on nonaccrual loans was  and  respectively none was recognized in 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that are considered impaired was  of which  is included in nonaccrual loans  and  is included in restructured loans above 
impaired loans had a valuation allowance of  the average recorded investment in impaired loans during was  the company recognized interest income on impaired loans of   and  in  and  respectively including interest income of  on restructured loans in and in 
there were no troubled debt restructurings or loan concentrations in excess of of total loans not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans as of december  management is not aware of any potential problem loans  which were accruing and current at december   where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms 
the company held no real estate acquired by foreclosure at december  or allowance for loan losses the bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on our regular assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio and to a lesser extent  unused commitments to provide financing 
determining the adequacy of the allowance is a matter of careful judgment  which reflects consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula allowance  specific allowances for identified problem loans and the unallocated reserve 
the unallocated allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unused commitments  in each case based on the internal risk grade of such loans and commitments 
changes in risk grades of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the formula allowance 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
at december  the formula allowance was  compared to  at december  the increase in the formula allowance was primarily a result of the growth in loan balances in this category of  in in addition to the formula allowance calculated by the application of the loss factors to the standard loan categories  certain specific allowances may also be calculated 
quarterly  all criticized loans are analyzed individually based on the source and adequacy of repayment and specific type of collateral  and an assessment is made of the adequacy of the formula reserve relative to the individual loan 
a specific allocation higher than the formula reserve will be calculated based on the higher than normal probability of loss and or a collateral shortfall 
at december  the specific allowance was  on loan base of  compared to a specific allowance of  on a loan base of  at december  the increase in the specific allowance in was primarily attributable to one credit  which was performing at year end 
the unallocated allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem loans or portfolio segments 
at december  the unallocated allowance was  compared to  at december  the conditions evaluated in connection with the unallocated allowance include the following at the balance sheet date o the current national and local economic and business conditions  trends and developments  including the condition of various market segments within our lending area  o changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  o changes in the nature  mix  concentrations and volume of the loan portfolio  o the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank s current portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the adverse impact of any of these conditions on the bank will not be in excess of the unallocated allowance as determined by management at december and set forth in the preceding paragraph 
the allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans at december  compared to  or at december  at those two dates  the allowance represented and percent of nonperforming loans 
in  the allowance for loan losses was increased in consideration of the significant growth in the loan portfolio of   geographic and industry concentrations  expansion into new geographic markets  and volatility and weaknesses in the local economy  including potential effects of power shortages  water supply  and volatile market prices for agricultural products 
in addition  approximately million was provided as a result of the downward classification to substandard of several loans to a single borrower 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss potential  including economic factors  overall credit quality  historical delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss provision and allowance are adequate 
however  no prediction of the ultimate level of loans charged off in future years can be made with any certainty

inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing  or other commercial concerns  primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary 
in general  inflation primarily affects the company indirectly through its effect on market rates of interest  and thus the ability of the bank to attract loan customers 
inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand  and potentially adversely affects the company s capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase faster than the corresponding rate that capital grows through retention of earnings the company generates in the future 
in addition to its effects on interest rates  inflation directly affects the company by increasing the company s operating expenses 
inflation did not have a material effect upon the company s results of operations during the year market risk management overview 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the bank is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the bank to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the company s interest rate risk management policies 
the bank has an asset and liability management committee alco  which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include but are not limited to lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities and issuing debt 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
the bank uses simulation models to forecast earnings  net interest margin and market value of equity 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
using computer modeling techniques  the company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared quarterly using inputs of actual loan  securities and interest bearing liabilities ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 
the forecast balance sheet is processed against three interest rate scenarios 
the scenarios include a basis point rising rate forecast  a flat rate forecast and a basis point falling rate forecast which take place within a one year time frame 
the net interest income is measured during the first year of the rate changes and in the year following the rate changes 
the company s net interest income  as forecast below  was modeled utilizing a forecast balance sheet projected from year end balances 
the following assumptions were used in the modeling activity earning asset growth of based on ending balances loan growth of based on ending balances investment and funds sold growth of based on ending balances deposit growth of based on ending balances balance sheet target balances were the same for all rate scenarios the following table summarizes the effect on net interest income of a basis point change in interest rates as measured against a flat rate no change scenario 
table eight interest rate risk simulation of net interest income as of december  estimated impact on net interest income in thousands variation from flat rate scenario the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions  which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk 
the company also uses a second simulation scenario that rate shocks the balance sheet with an immediate parallel shift in interest rates of basis points 
this scenario provides estimates of the future market value of equity mve and net interest income nii 
mve measures the impact on equity due to the changes in the market values of assets and liabilities as a result of a change in interest rates 
the bank measures the volatility of these benchmarks using a twelve month time horizon 
using the december  balance sheet as the base for the simulation  the following table summarizes the effect on net interest income of a basis point change in interest rates table nine interest rate risk simulation of nii as of december change change in nii in nii from current from current mo 
horizon month horizon in thousands bp  bp  these results indicate that the balance sheet is asset sensitive since earnings increase when interest rates rise 
the magnitude of the nii change is within the company s policy guidelines 
the asset liability management policy limits aggregate market risk  as measured in this fashion  to an acceptable level within the context of risk return trade offs 
gap analysis provides another measure of interest rate risk 
the company does not actively use gap analysis in managing interest rate risk 
it is presented here for comparative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the bank s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the bank s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
as reflected in table ten  at december   the cumulative gap through the one year time horizon indicates a slightly liability sensitive position 
somewhere between one and five years the bank moves into an asset sensitive position 
this interest rate sensitivity table categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing immediately 
however  as has been observed through interest rate cycles  the deposit liabilities do not reprice immediately 
consequently  the bank s net interest income varies as though the bank is asset sensitive  ie as interest rates rise net interest income increases and vice versa 
the asset sensitivity is validated by the modeling as presented in tables eight and nine and the actual operating results in as the net interest margin decreased during a rapidly falling interest rate environment

both assets and liabilities contribute to the company s liquidity position 
federal funds lines  short term investments and securities  and loan repayments contribute to liquidity  along with deposit increases  while loan funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity 
the bank assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs 
commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at december   were approximately  and  respectively 
such loans relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans  and to real estate construction loans 
the company s sources of liquidity consist of overnight funds sold to correspondent banks  unpledged marketable investments  loans pledged to the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb sf and sellable sba loans 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of total assets as compared to million or of total consolidated assets on december  in addition to liquid assets  the bank maintains short term lines of credit with correspondent banks 
at december   the bank had  available under these credit lines 
informal agreements are also in place with various other banks to purchase participations in loans  if necessary 
the company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and  as such  its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
liquidity is affected by portfolio maturities as well as the affect interest rate fluctuations have on the market values of both assets and liabilities 
the bank holds all of its investment securities in the available for sale category 
this enables the bank to sell any of its unpledged securities to meet liquidity needs 
in periods of rising interest rates  such as experienced throughout most of and the first half of  bond prices decreased  which resulted in large unrealized losses within the bank s investment portfolio 
unrealized losses limit the bank s ability to sell these securities to provide liquidity without realizing those losses 
as a means for providing liquidity from the investment portfolio when there are unrealized losses  the bank has a master repurchase agreement with a correspondent bank 
such a repurchase agreement allows the bank to pledge securities as collateral for borrowings to obtain liquidity without having to sell a security at a loss 
in a declining interest rate environment such as experienced in  as bond prices increase  liquidity is more easily obtained through security sales 
the maturity distribution of certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more is set forth in table eleven 
these deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and  therefore  are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available

these cash requirements are funded through direct reimbursement billings to the bank 
for non banking functions  the company is dependent upon the payment of cash dividends by the bank to service its commitments 
the company expects that the cash dividends paid by the bank to the company will be sufficient to meet this payment schedule 
off balance sheet items the bank has certain ongoing commitments under operating leases 
see note of the financial statements for the terms 
these commitments do not significantly impact operating results 
as of december   commitments to extend credit were the only financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
the bank has not entered into any contracts for freestanding financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options etc and did not identify any embedded derivatives 
loan and letter of credit commitments increased to  from  at december  the commitments represent of total loans at year end versus a year ago 
the majority of the commitments have a maturity of one year or less 
commitments for home equity lines of credit totaling  which have a ten year maturity  are the single largest category of commitments exceeding a one year maturity 
disclosure of fair value the financial accounting standards board fasb  adopted statement of financial accounting standards number  disclosures about fair value of financial statements  requiring the disclosure of fair value of most financial instruments  whether recognized or not recognized in the financial statements 
the intent of presenting the fair values of financial instruments is to depict the market s assessment of the present value of net future cash flows discounted to reflect both current interest rates and the market s assessment of the risk that the cash flows will not occur 
in determining fair values  the company used the carrying amount for cash  short term investments  accrued interest receivable  short term borrowings and accrued interest payable as all of these instruments are short term in nature 
securities are reflected at quoted market values 
loans and deposits have a long term time horizon  which required more complex calculations for fair value determination 
loans are grouped into homogeneous categories and broken down between fixed and variable rate instruments 
loans with a variable rate  which reprice quickly  are valued at carrying value 
the fair value of fixed rate instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates 
credit risk and repricing risk factors are included in the current rates 
fair value for nonaccrual loans is reported at carrying value and is included in the net loan total 
since the allowance for loan losses exceeds any potential adjustment for nonaccrual valuation  no further valuation adjustment has been made 
demand deposits  savings and certain money market accounts are short term in nature so the carrying value equals the fair value 
for deposits that extend over a period in excess of four months  the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash payments using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities 
at year end the fair values calculated on the bank s assets were above the carrying values versus under the carrying values at year end accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

other matters the terrorist actions on september  and thereafter have had significant adverse effects upon the united states economy 
whether the terrorist activities in the future and the actions of the united states and its allies in combating terrorism on a worldwide basis will adversely impact the company and the extent of such impact is uncertain 
however  such events have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the economy in the company s market areas 
such continued economic deterioration could adversely affect the company s future results of operations by  among other matters  reducing the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company  increasing nonperforming loans and the amounts reserved for loan losses  and causing a decline in the company s stock price
