item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general we report our consolidated and individual segment results of operations on a or week fiscal year ending on the last thursday in may 
fiscal and fiscal were week years  while fiscal was a week year 
our upcoming fiscal will be a week year 
we divide our fiscal year into three week quarters and a final quarter consisting of or weeks 
our primary operations are reported in three business segments limited service lodging  theatres and hotels resorts 
as a result of the sale of our kfc restaurants during fiscal  the restaurant business segment has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and in this discussion 
historically  our first fiscal quarter has produced the strongest operating results because this period coincides with the typical summer seasonality of the movie theatre industry and the summer strength of our lodging businesses 
our third fiscal quarter has historically produced the weakest operating results primarily due to the effects of reduced travel during the winter months on our lodging businesses 
an outstanding year for our movie theatres  reduced interest rates and the favorable impact of historic tax credits related to our kansas city hotel phillips project contributed to increased net earnings during fiscal  despite a difficult year for our two lodging divisions 
the economic downturn  which actually started during the latter half of fiscal and was accentuated by the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks  resulted in a significant decline in lodging demand during fiscal  particularly from our core business customers 
in fact  the lodging industry s decline in demand during this time period was the worst the industry has experienced in the past years 
as a result  the operating results of our lodging divisions were adversely impacted during this past year  particularly during our fiscal second quarter september through november

our theatre and hotels resorts divisions contributed to the increase in revenues during both fiscal years 
our limited service lodging division revenues decreased during fiscal after increasing slightly during fiscal comparisons to our fiscal revenues are impacted by the additional week of operations that we reported during that year 
the extra week during fiscal contributed million in revenues to our fourth quarter and year end results 
effective june   we elected to early adopt emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives 
for comparison purposes  certain discounts previously accounted for as a marketing expense in fiscal and fiscal have been reclassified as a reduction of revenues see note to the consolidated financial statements  new accounting pronouncements 
a record operating performance from our theatre division resulted in an increase in overall operating income earnings before other income expense and income taxes  despite decreases in operating income from our two lodging divisions 
comparisons to last year s results are adversely impacted by the additional week of operations that we reported during fiscal the extra week contributed million in operating income to last year s fourth quarter and year end results 
on the other hand  significantly reduced utility and snow removal costs during fiscal compared to last year favorably impacted each of our divisions by a total of million and  respectively 
these same utility and snow removal costs increased during fiscal and negatively impacted each of our divisions by an aggregate of million and  respectively  compared to fiscal overall  reduced operating income from our limited service lodging division accounted for the majority of the decrease in our operating income during fiscal compared to fiscal results excluding the impact of the asset impairment charge 
in addition to our increased fiscal operating income  reduced interest expense  increased gains on the disposition of property  equipment and investments in joint ventures and a reduced effective income tax rate contributed to our increased earnings from continuing operations and net earnings during fiscal comparisons of our fiscal earnings from continuing operations and net earnings to prior year results are negatively impacted by a non taxable gain of million recognized during fiscal from insurance contracts on the life of the company s founder  ben marcus 
increased interest expense and reduced gains on disposition of property and equipment  offset by the gain on insurance contracts  contributed to our decreased earnings from continuing operations during fiscal compared to fiscal our net interest expense  net of investment income  totaled million for fiscal this represented a decrease of million  or  from fiscal net interest expense of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower short term interest rates  in addition to decreased long term debt levels 
our total long term debt was lower than last year throughout this year due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our kfc restaurants in may  increased cash generated from operations and reduced capital expenditures during fiscal fiscal net interest expense increased million  or  over fiscal net interest expense of million 
this increase was the result of additional borrowings in fiscal and fiscal used to help finance our capital expansion program and stock repurchase program  partially offset by increased investment income and capitalized interest 
we recognized gains on disposition of property  equipment and investments in joint ventures from continuing operations of million during fiscal  compared to gains on disposition of property and equipment of  and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of the fiscal gain was the result of a sale of a joint venture baymont inn suites property during the first quarter of the year  with the remainder of the gain arising from the sale of excess land at our grand geneva property to the developer of the timber ridge lodge project 
the timing of our periodic sales of property and equipment results in variations in the gains or losses that we report on disposition of property and equipment each year 
we had plans during fiscal to sell additional selected baymont inns suites and other assets  but a tight financing environment resulting from the deteriorating economic conditions in the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks made it difficult to sell these assets during the year 
if economic conditions and the financing environment for potential buyers improves during fiscal  we believe that additional gains on disposition of property and equipment may be recognized during the coming year 
we reported income tax expense on continuing operations for fiscal of million  an increase of million over fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the significantly lower effective tax rate during the current year was the result of the favorable impact of federal and state historic tax credits related to the renovation of the hotel phillips in kansas city  missouri 
without these historic tax credits  our fiscal net earnings would have been approximately million or 
per share lower than we reported 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal declined as a result of the non taxable gain on insurance contracts 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate during fiscal will return to levels more closely approximating the fiscal tax rate 
net earnings during fiscal included after tax income from discontinued operations of million  or 
per share  and an after tax gain on the disposal of our discontinued restaurant operations during the fourth quarter of million  or 
per share a detailed discussion of this item is included in the discontinued operations section 
fiscal net earnings included after tax income from discontinued operations of million  or

weighted average shares outstanding were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal all per share data is presented on a diluted basis 
we adopted statement of financial standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective june  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
we completed the required transitional impairment test and deemed that no impairment loss was necessary 
any subsequent impairment losses will be reflected in our operating income in the income statement 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased amortization of goodwill with a book value of million as of june  the majority of this goodwill resulted from prior theatre acquisitions 
had amortization of goodwill not been recorded in fiscal and  net earnings would have increased by approximately  net of taxes  and earnings per share would have increased by 
for each year 
current plans we incurred approximately million in aggregate capital expenditures during fiscal after averaging over million per year during the prior six fiscal years 
we entered this year with plans to spend approximately to million  but we took steps to reduce non essential capital spending in response to the september terrorist attacks 
we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures during fiscal will again be in the to million range  but we will continue to monitor our operating results and economic conditions so that we can respond appropriately 
our current strategic plans include the following goals and strategies o continuing to define and build our baymont inns suites brand  with a goal to be the best in class in the mid price without food and beverage segment of the lodging industry 
we currently believe that most of our limited service lodging division s anticipated future growth in earnings will ultimately come as a result of revenue growth at our company owned inns as the brand captures a greater share of its segment of the industry and from our emphasis on opening new franchised baymont inns and baymont inns suites 
as of the end of fiscal  new franchised properties were under development  two to four of which are expected to open during fiscal as a result of the reduced demand for lodging and a constrained financing market for new hotel development in the aftermath of september  industry supply growth has also slowed considerably 
accordingly  we currently have significantly fewer new franchised inns in development than we would have expected at this time 
as conditions improve  we hope to approve to new franchised properties per year over the next few fiscal years 
by emphasizing franchising  we believe the baymont brand may grow more rapidly  conserving our capital for other strategic purposes 
we also anticipate exploring additional growth of the baymont brand through potential acquisitions and joint venture investments  focusing on selected key strategic urban and suburban markets 
our first such planned joint venture involves the development of our first location in an important california market 
we are also currently in the early stages of developing our first urban baymont inn suites in downtown chicago  illinois  with an opening expected sometime in fiscal o maximizing the return on our significant recent investments in movie theatres through both revenue and cost improvements 
we have invested over million in our theatre division over the last six fiscal years  more than doubling our number of company owned movie theatre screens from at the end of fiscal to screens at the end of fiscal we also offer stadium seating in approximately of our first run screens  the highest percentage in the industry 
we also entered the theatre management business during fiscal  signing an agreement to manage screens for another owner  bringing the total number of screens owned or managed by our theatre division to screens at year end 
with several of our smaller theatres scheduled for closing and several selected screen additions planned for existing locations  we do not anticipate our total screen count to significantly change during fiscal  unless attractive acquisition opportunities present themselves 
o maximizing the return on our significant recent investments in hotel projects and doubling the number of rooms either managed or owned by our hotels and resorts division to  rooms over the next three to five years 
many of the recent growth opportunities for our hotels and resorts division marcus vacation club  hilton madison  hotel phillips  timber ridge lodge and hilton milwaukee improvements required a lengthy development period during which significant capital was committed and the related pre opening costs and early start up losses reduced division operating income 
we expect these recent development projects to provide earnings growth opportunities during fiscal and beyond 
we anticipate that the majority of the potential growth in rooms managed will come from management contracts for other owners 
in some cases  we may own a partial interest in the new managed properties 
one strategy that we are currently exploring involves the creation of an equity fund that would invest in existing hotel properties 
under this strategy  we would make limited equity investments and would enter into management contracts to manage the properties for the fund 
the actual number  mix and timing of potential future new facilities and expansions will depend in large part on industry and economic conditions  our financial performance and available capital  the competitive environment  evolving customer needs and trends  customer acceptance of the new baymont brand  our ability to increase the number of franchised baymont locations at a pace consistent with our current plans and the availability of attractive opportunities 
it is likely that our growth goals will continue to evolve and change in response to these and other factors  and there can be no assurance that these current goals will be achieved 
the terrorist attacks of september  were unprecedented 
we are unable to predict with certainty if or when lodging demand will return to pre september levels 
we believe that the uncertainty associated with the war on terrorism and possible future terrorist attacks will continue to hamper the travel and lodging industries during some or all of fiscal any additional terrorist attacks may have a similar or worse effect on the lodging industry than that experienced as a result of the september attacks 
theatres our oldest and largest division is our theatre division 
the theatre division contributed of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated operating income  excluding corporate items  during fiscal the theatre division operates motion picture theatres in wisconsin  illinois  ohio and minnesota  and a family entertainment center in wisconsin

the significant increase in theatre division revenues during fiscal compared to the prior year occurred despite the fact that fiscal results included an additional week of operations 
the additional week of operations included in the theatre division s fiscal results contributed million to total theatre division revenues  accounting for the majority of the fiscal revenue increase compared to fiscal the additional week of operations included the traditionally strong memorial day holiday weekend 
new screens added during fiscal and fiscal also contributed to the revenue increases during each year 
consistent with our long term strategic plan to focus on operating large multi screen theatres  we added new screens to five existing theatres during fiscal  including our second large ultrascreen tm  which opened at a madison  wisconsin location 
no new screens were added during fiscal the new screens added during fiscal generated additional revenues of  to fiscal revenues compared to fiscal and million to fiscal revenues compared to fiscal as of may   we operated first run screens and budget screens 
compared to first run theatres  budget theatres generally have lower box office revenues and associated film costs  but higher concession sales as a percentage of box office revenue 
five theatres with a total of screens were closed during fiscal  negatively impacting this year s theatre division revenues by million with minimal impact on operating income 
one theatre with a total of six screens was closed during fiscal in addition  a four screen theatre in stevens point  wisconsin was sold and a five screen theatre in wausau  wisconsin was purchased 
these transactions had minimal impact on operations in fiscal we have identified approximately five to seven theatres with screens that we may close over the next three years with minimal impact on operating results

in millions  except percentages box office receipts concession revenues other revenues total revenues revenues for the theatre business and the motion picture industry in general are heavily dependent on the general audience appeal of available films  together with studio marketing  advertising and support campaigns  factors over which we have no control 
this was particularly evident during the last two fiscal years 
total theatre attendance increased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
this compares to a decrease in total attendance during fiscal compared to fiscal attendance at our comparable locations increased during fiscal and decreased during fiscal  compared to the previous years 
while additional competitive theatre screens in several of our markets had some negative impact on our attendance during both fiscal years  the primary factor contributing to the increase in attendance during fiscal and decrease in attendance during fiscal was the quality and quantity of film product during each respective year 
fiscal was a record year at the box office both nationally and for our theatre division 
in a year of multiple blockbusters  our top performing films accounted for of our total box office receipts  compared to for our top films during fiscal four fiscal films produced box office receipts in excess of million 
surprisingly  not one of our top eight performing films during fiscal was a summer movie  a time during which blockbuster films are often showcased 
the following fiscal films produced box office receipts in excess of million harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  lord of the rings  monsters  inc  spider man  star wars ii attack of the clones  ice age  a beautiful mind  ocean s eleven  rush hour and jurassic park only five films topped the million level for box office receipts during fiscal how the grinch stole christmas  cast away  what women want  the perfect storm and meet the parents 
we played  and films at our theatres during fiscal years  and  respectively 
included in the total films played were  and new imax r films during each fiscal year  respectively 
our average ticket price increased and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  compared to the prior year 
ticket prices were increased during each fiscal year in order to reflect the significant investments in stadium seating and digital sound that have been made in the majority of our theatres 
first run theatre average ticket prices increased during fiscal and during fiscal  compared to the respective prior years 
our average concession sales per person increased and during fiscal years and  respectively 
average concession sales per person are impacted by changes in concession pricing  types of films played and changes in our geographic mix of theatre locations 
many of the top films during fiscal were excellent family fare  which traditionally produce better than average concession sales 
our theatre division s operating margin increased to during fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
contributing to the improved fiscal operating margin were increased concession revenues  reduced utility and snow removal costs and reduced advertising costs 
the fiscal operating margin declined despite the additional week of operations included in the theatre division s fiscal results  which contributed approximately million to fiscal operating income 
fiscal and fiscal operating margins were impacted by the disappointing film product and increased occupancy expenses associated with recent capital investments 
fiscal operating results were also negatively impacted by high utility costs  unusually high snow removal costs during december  and significant losses from our two imax r theatre screens 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  during fiscal  we evaluated the recoverability of the assets related to our two imax r theatre screens  and determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of these assets 
based upon discounted estimated cash flows  we believe that the imax r related assets have minimal fair value and  accordingly  the approximately million carrying value of the assets was written off during fiscal we believe that the performance of our imax r theatres has not met expectations because of the lack of commercially viable film product for this format 
as a result  we will occasionally feature traditional millimeter film product on these screens when viable imax r film product is not available 
we currently plan to continue operating our two imax r theatres for the foreseeable future and we are encouraged by recent film releases and announcements for future film development 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered the theatre management contract business by signing an agreement to manage screens at three inner city chicago locations for another owner 
having experience with management contracts in our hotels and resorts division  we believe that providing theatre management expertise to third party owners for a fee can be a profitable business strategy for our theatre division  increasing the number of screens managed by our existing management team without a capital investment on our part 
we are currently pursuing additional management contract opportunities 
during fiscal and beyond  we expect to make additional selected investments in new screens at existing strategic locations 
we believe that our long term competitive position has been strengthened as a result of our significant capital investments over the past few years 
although it is difficult to predict future box office performance  film product for the remainder of calendar appears very strong  with the first half of the summer outperforming our prior year and much anticipated sequels to harry potter and lord of the rings due to be released later in unless film product during the second half of fiscal significantly underperforms compared to fiscal third and fourth quarter films  we expect fiscal to be another strong year for our theatre division 
limited service lodging our second largest division is the limited service lodging division  which contributed of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated operating income  excluding corporate items  during fiscal the division s business consists of owning and franchising baymont inns suites and woodfield suites  which respectively operate in the segments of the lodging industry designated as limited service mid price without food and beverage and limited service all suites 
we also own and operate one budgetel inn 
during fiscal  we converted a baymont inn suites in appleton  wisconsin back to a budgetel inn in order to preserve certain legal rights regarding the budgetel name

our adr for fiscal was just over  which is relatively low compared to other competing lodging chains within the mid price lodging segment 
baymont s occupancy percentage number of occupied rooms as a percentage of available rooms decreased and percentage points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the result of the adr changes and occupancy declines was a and decrease in baymont inns suites revenue per available room  or revpar  for comparable inns for fiscal and  respectively 
revpar for comparable woodfield suites decreased during fiscal and during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year  respectively 
the primary factor contributing to the declines in our occupancy and revpar was reduced business travel  as companies reacted to the slowing economic environment 
this trend dramatically accelerated as a result of the events of september our adr  which had increased dramatically over the past two years in conjunction with our repositioning of the baymont inns suites brand from the lower priced economy segment of the lodging industry to the mid price segment  declined as a result of competitive pressures from the significantly reduced room demand 
the division s quarterly revpar trends percentage change in revpar for the quarter compared to the prior year s same quarter for the last three fiscal years have been as follows revpar change st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter as the table indicates  at the end of fiscal  the percentage change in revpar at comparable baymont inns suites had been improving  due primarily to increased market awareness of the baymont brand and the addition of lobby breakfasts at the majority of the company owned baymont locations 
inns with lobby breakfasts consistently performed significantly better than inns without the lobby breakfast  due to favorable guest response to the new amenity and increased average rates realized as a result of offering that amenity 
we offered the lobby breakfasts at all of our owned inns by the end of the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we continued to aggressively increase our room rates  positioning the baymont brand at a price point that we believed was consistent with comparable properties in the mid price segment of the lodging industry 
however  beginning in the winter of  the economic environment weakened and our occupancy declined  resulting in small decreases in revpar during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the performance of our baymont inns suites during fiscal tracked fairly consistently with the results of the majority of the properties in this limited service  mid priced lodging industry segment 
industry wide occupancy rates were generally declining prior to september as a result of the then slowing economy  as evidenced by our revpar decline during the first fiscal quarter 
in the first full week after september  industry wide occupancy rates for the mid scale without food and beverage segment declined by approximately compared to the same period last year 
industry and baymont occupancy rates have improved considerably in the subsequent months  but our revpar declines remained at during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as indicated earlier  an overall reduction in business travel as a result of the economic environment continues to be the primary reason for the reduced occupancies 
in general  we believe that limited service lodging properties have performed better than their full service counterparts as a result of travelers trading down from higher priced hotels 
we also believe that baymont  in particular  may be benefiting from the fact that it derives a large portion of its occupancies from the over the road traveler and the majority of its inns are not in urban and destination resort locations  which have been most severely impacted by the aftermath of september we responded to the current environment by focusing on reducing our costs  reducing operational payroll and corporate overhead and restructuring our operational management and supervisory teams 
the majority of the division s decrease in operating income during fiscal occurred during september and october  when occupancy declines were greatest and cost control measures had not been fully implemented 
in fact  the division s operating income during the second half of fiscal was substantially better than the same period last year  despite the additional week of operations reported in our fiscal results 
the additional week of operations included in the limited service lodging division s fiscal results contributed approximately million to fiscal operating income 
in addition to the various cost control measures and reduced utility costs described earlier  the division s operating results during the second half of fiscal compared to fiscal were favorably impacted by the fact that we incurred approximately million in one time costs during fiscal related to our introduction of our new guest ovations tm frequent stay reward program  the development of new interior design packages and the implementation of a new systemwide training program 
increased franchise revenues also helped to offset the reduced income from company owned properties in each of the last two years 
we opened one new company owned baymont inn suites and purchased one baymont inn suites from a franchisee during fiscal no company owned properties were opened during fiscal and fiscal we have not opened a new woodfield suites during the past two years after opening one during fiscal our newly opened and acquired baymont inn suites and woodfield suites contributed additional revenues of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  with nominal operating income 
one joint venture baymont inn suites managed by us was sold to a franchisee during the year 
our share of the gain on sale was million 
we sold one baymont inn suites to a franchisee during fiscal and sold four baymont inns during fiscal  including one to a franchisee 
a pre tax loss of approximately  and pre tax gains of approximately million were recognized during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of the sale of these inns 
in addition  selling these properties negatively impacted fiscal revenues by  compared to fiscal and negatively impacted fiscal revenues by million compared to fiscal we have identified additional baymont inns suites that will be considered for sale to new and existing franchisees 
we believe that this strategy will give our franchise partners the opportunity to develop a significant market presence while allowing us to utilize the sales proceeds for other growth opportunities  including developing baymont properties in new markets 
although this strategy will result in reduced revenues until after the sales proceeds are reinvested in other revenue generating facilities  we expect a resulting increase in profitability over time 
although the near term outlook for the industry and baymont in particular is uncertain given the current economic climate  we continue to believe that our long term strategy to build our baymont brand will result in increased revpar in the future 
the significantly reduced supply growth throughout the industry  while slowing our franchising growth  should also favorably impact our operating results of existing hotels as an economic recovery ultimately occurs 
we have introduced several new features during the past two years which are designed to build the baymont brand  including a new satisfaction guarantee  new sales and marketing programs and a new frequent stay reward program  guest ovations tm 
we also continue to update the exterior of many of our company owned baymonts with a fresh  new exterior renovation package that has typically resulted in improved operating performance at our older locations 
we are encouraged by the fact that at the end of fiscal  our frequent stay program had approximately  members and was contributing approximately of our total room revenues 
in general  properties that have one of our prototypical exterior designs  or have undergone an exterior renovation  and have had a full year of our dedicated property specific sales effort are performing better than those without these key elements 
the division s current strategies focus on increasing occupancy and brand awareness 
the division outsourced its reservation center during the second quarter of fiscal  which we believe should result in reduced costs and increased reservation system contributions to occupancy in the future 
our reservations from the central reservation center increased over during the second half of fiscal  compared to the same period last year 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we will further enhance our reservation technology by introducing full two way connectivity between the reservation center and the individual property  increasing our ability to offer all available rooms over every available sales channel  including our rapidly growing internet and travel agent sales 
at the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter  we introduced and began marketing our new ovations rooms  which feature additional amenities not normally found in the limited service lodging sector  including pillow top mattresses  down lite tm pillows and complimentary in room bottled water  an industry first 
as a result of all of these efforts  subject to economic and industry conditions  we believe that we can successfully position the baymont brand to capture additional market share and increase our revpar and profitability in the future 
hotels and resorts the hotels and resorts division contributed of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated operating income  excluding corporate items  during fiscal the hotels and resorts division owns and operates two full service hotels in downtown milwaukee  wisconsin  a full facility destination resort in lake geneva  wisconsin  a boutique luxury resort in indian wells  california  and full service hotels in madison  wisconsin  and downtown kansas city  missouri 
in addition  we managed four hotels during fiscal and three hotels during the previous two years for other owners 
a fifth managed hotel was added at the end of fiscal we also manage a vacation ownership development in lake geneva  wisconsin

division revenues increased during fiscal due to the added revenues from our newly opened hotels  the hotel phillips in kansas city  missouri and the hilton madison at monona terrace  in addition to revenues from our management of the timber ridge lodge 
our revenues increased during fiscal due to increased revpar at company owned properties  a full year of sales of vacation ownership units at the grand geneva resort spa in lake geneva  wisconsin  and the opening of the hilton milwaukee room addition and water park and the hilton madison 
our hotels and resorts division operating income during fiscal declined compared to the prior year entirely as a result of the september terrorist attacks  challenging economic environment and resulting reduced business travel 
operating margins were further negatively impacted during fiscal and by million and million  respectively  in pre opening expenses related to our new hotel projects 
the events of september and the ensuing further economic downturn had a significant negative impact on the operating results of our hotels and resorts division during the second quarter of fiscal september through november 
in fact  our entire decrease in fiscal hotels and resorts division operating income compared to the prior year occurred during the second quarter 
historically  higher priced upscale hotels have always experienced more challenges during difficult economic environments than lower priced  limited service properties 
the negative impact on this division was most severe during september and october  when a significant number of group cancellations occurred 
according to data from smith travel research  during the first full week after september  industry wide occupancy rates for upper upscale hotels dropped approximately and revpar declined over compared to the same period during the prior year 
similar to limited service lodging  results in this industry segment have since improved  but are still not approaching pre september levels 
industrywide revpar declines compared to the prior year s period for the upper upscale segment leveled off at during november  december and january  before improving to declines of approximately during may 
our hotels and resorts have outperformed the industry during this time period  we believe due at least partially to our particular property mix 
our properties are generally located in mid size cities and resort areas within driving distance from major midwest population centers  which have not been affected as significantly by the downturn as major east and west coast destinations 
excluding the recently opened hotel phillips and hilton madison at monona terrace  the division s total revpar for comparable company owned properties decreased during fiscal compared to last year 
given that our fiscal second quarter revpar was down compared to the second quarter of fiscal  we are encouraged by the fact that our third and fourth quarter revpar declines were only and  respectively 
the entire decrease in revpar during fiscal was the result of reduced occupancies  as our division wide adr actually increased slightly during the year 
this was the result of our intentional strategy to maintain the integrity of our rate structure during this difficult time period 
during the first half of fiscal  our revpar at comparable properties increased over the same period in fiscal the second half of fiscal  however  was impacted by a weakening economic climate  resulting in reduced business travel and reduced occupancy at our hotels and resorts 
by the time our fiscal year ended  the division s comparable properties had reported only a increase in revpar  compared to the prior year 
we have responded to the current economic circumstances by focusing on controlling costs and  as a result  we reported slightly improved operating losses during the second half of fiscal despite the reduction in revpar and the extra week of operations included in fiscal we also continue to maintain our properties consistent with our traditional high standards  including taking advantage of the seasonal lower occupancies during winter and spring to undertake previously planned major room renovations at two of our premier properties  the pfister and the grand geneva 
as noted in the limited service lodging discussion  while we are encouraged by the overall improvement we have seen in our revpar in recent months  we still anticipate some residual negative impact on the revenues of our hotels and resorts division during fiscal in particular  properties such as the pfister and the hotel phillips  which rely more heavily on the individual business traveler  will continue to be affected until revenues from this segment of our customer base return to previous levels 
group and leisure business  on the other hand  has improved since the initial cancellations after september occupancy rates at properties that cater to group and leisure guests  such as the grand geneva resort and spa and timber ridge lodge and to a certain extent the hilton milwaukee and hilton madison  have improved considerably  with all four of these properties contributing positively to year over year comparisons during the second half of fiscal a full year of maturation at our newer properties  as well as a reduction in preopening expenses  should contribute to improved operating margins and overall operating income for this division during fiscal the hilton milwaukee city center opened an addition during the first quarter of fiscal  making it the largest hotel in wisconsin with rooms 
the addition also included a family water park fun center  which opened during the fiscal second quarter 
a skywalk to milwaukee s new midwest express convention center and a new restaurant were added during fiscal and a new parking structure was completed and opened during the first quarter of fiscal with all major projects completed at this hotel for the first time in several years  we expect the hilton milwaukee to contribute to earnings growth in the years ahead 
the division s new hilton madison at monona terrace  a room hotel connected by skywalk to the monona terrace convention center in madison  wisconsin opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal taking the events of september and resulting economic downturn into account  we are very pleased with the operating performance of this property during its first year 
late during fiscal  we purchased the hotel phillips  a downtown kansas city  missouri landmark property 
we closed the property during the fall of in order to undertake a complete restoration of the hotel 
the room hotel had the unfortunate timing of reopening on september  and thus got off to a slower than anticipated start 
the hotel has received excellent reviews from the community and our guests and we look forward to steady improvement  particularly when the economic environment improves and business travel returns to prior levels 
we also began management in july of the timber ridge lodge  a condominium hotel project adjacent to the grand geneva resort spa in lake geneva  wisconsin and began management of a new hilton garden inn in houston  texas in may during fiscal  our vacation ownership development at the grand geneva resort spa contributed revenues of million and negatively impacted operating income by approximately  the weakened economy during fiscal contributed to a slight reduction in timeshare sales to million  but reduced sales and marketing expenses contributed to a  improvement in operating income from this business during fiscal we expect our operating performance from this development to continue to improve and we anticipate building additional ownership units during fiscal discontinued operations on may   we sold our kfc and kfc taco bell in restaurants to h k partners  llc h k 
the assets sold consisted primarily of land  buildings and equipment 
proceeds from the sale of approximately million consisted of million in cash and a  promissory note 
we realized a net before tax gain of million million after tax during fiscal as a result of the sale 
the asset purchase agreement with h k provided for a potential additional future purchase price payment if certain performance conditions were met 
shortly after the fiscal year end  h k elected to terminate this provision of the agreement by paying us an additional million of proceeds 
as a result  an additional gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax  of approximately million or 
per share will be reported during the first quarter of fiscal prior to the sale  we had non exclusive franchise rights to operate kfc restaurants in the milwaukee metropolitan area and in northeast wisconsin 
we operated kfc restaurants and three kfc taco bell in restaurants during the fiscal years and the following table sets forth revenues  operating income  and operating margin for the discontinued operations for the last three fiscal years

in millions  except percentages revenues operating income operating margin financial condition liquidity and capital resources our lodging and movie theatre businesses each generate significant and relatively consistent daily amounts of cash because each segment s revenue is derived predominantly from consumer cash purchases 
we believe that these relatively consistent and predictable cash sources  together with the availability of million of unused credit lines at fiscal year end  should be adequate to support the ongoing operational liquidity needs of our businesses 
early in the third quarter of fiscal  we replaced an expiring day revolving credit agreement with a new million  day revolving credit agreement with several banks 
any borrowings under the new credit line will bear interest at libor plus a margin which adjusts based on our borrowing levels 
in addition  on april   we issued million in senior unsecured long term notes privately placed with six institutional lenders 
the notes  which bear interest at an average rate of  were issued under a previously announced private placement program and mature in and proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay off existing short term debt and fund our capital expenditure program 
based upon current debt levels and interest rates in effect at the end of fiscal  we expect our annual interest expense to increase by approximately million during fiscal as a result of the issuance of these senior notes in lieu of existing short term borrowings 
the actual increase in interest expense may differ due to changing debt levels during the year 
we believe that our long term interests are best served by having a significant portion of our outstanding debt with longer maturities  due to the significant real estate component of our total assets 
freeing up our borrowing capacity under our credit lines also provides us with significantly more flexibility in the future  giving us readily available capital if attractive opportunities present themselves 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  or  to million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased earnings from continuing operations  a reduction in real estate and development costs and timing differences in payments of accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
the reduction in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of reduced capital expenditures  offset by decreased net proceeds from disposals of property  equipment and other assets 
cash proceeds from the disposals of property  equipment and other assets totaled million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the cash proceeds received during fiscal were primarily the result of the sale of several parcels of land 
the cash proceeds received during fiscal were primarily the result of the sale of our discontinued restaurant operations  in addition to the sale of one baymont inn suites  two former restaurant locations and the sale of a parcel of land adjacent to the grand geneva resort spa to the developers of the new timber ridge lodge 
total capital expenditures including normal continuing capital maintenance projects and business acquisitions of million and million were incurred in fiscal and  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal included million incurred in the hotels and resorts division  including the renovation of the hotel phillips  our investment in the common areas of the timber ridge lodge  construction of a new parking garage at the hilton milwaukee city center  and room renovations at the grand geneva resort spa and pfister hotel 
in addition  capital expenditures of million were incurred in the limited service lodging division and million were incurred by the theatre division to fund ongoing maintenance capital projects 
we have not altered our maintenance capital expenditure plans as a result of the current economic environment  but we did delay the start of some non critical capital projects  many of which are now scheduled for completion during fiscal during fiscal  million was incurred for hotels and resorts division projects  million for limited service lodging division projects and million for theatre division projects 
total capital expenditures in fiscal are currently expected to be approximately to million and are expected to be funded by cash generated from operations  net proceeds from the disposal of selected assets and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
the only new company owned location currently included in the fiscal capital expenditure plans is the anticipated development of our first urban baymont inn suites in downtown chicago 
the remaining capital is expected to be divided fairly evenly across all three divisions and will include selected theatre screen additions  potential strategic equity investments in hotel or limited service lodging projects  and maintenance and project capital 
principally as a result of our reduced capital spending during fiscal  our total debt decreased to million at the close of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal net cash used in financing activities in fiscal totaled million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal during fiscal  we received million of net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable and long term debt  compared to million during fiscal as indicated earlier  the fiscal proceeds were from the issuance of senior unsecured notes 
the majority of our borrowings during fiscal were from commercial paper and our revolving credit facilities 
we made total principal payments on notes payable and long term debt of million during fiscal  representing the payment of current maturities and payment of borrowings on commercial paper and revolving credit facilities with the proceeds from our senior note issuance 
total principal payments totaled million during fiscal our debt capitalization ratio was at may   compared to at the prior fiscal year end 
based upon our current expectations for fiscal capital expenditure levels and potential asset sales proceeds  we anticipate our long term debt total and debt capitalization ratio to continue to decline during fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased  of our common shares for approximately  in conjunction with the exercise of stock options  compared to  of common shares repurchased for approximately million primarily in the open market during fiscal our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of our outstanding common stock 
as of may   approximately million shares remained available under this authorization for repurchase 
any such repurchases are expected to be executed on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon a number of factors  including prevailing market conditions 
contractual obligations we have obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt and operating leases 
the following schedule details these obligations at may  in thousands payments due by period total less than after year years years years long term debt      operating lease obligations      total contractual obligations      included in our long term debt totals are commercial paper borrowings issued through agreements with two banks 
we have included these borrowings with long term debt because we have the ability and intent to replace the borrowings with long term borrowings under our credit lines 
additional detail describing our long term debt is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we guarantee debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures and other entities 
our joint venture partners also guarantee all or a portion of this same debt

variable interest rate debt outstanding as of may  was million  carried an average interest rate of  and represented of our total debt portfolio 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our borrowings under our revolving credit agreements  floating rate mortgages  industrial development revenue bonds and unsecured term notes 
fixed interest rate debt totaled million as of may   carried an average interest rate of and represented of our total debt portfolio 
fixed interest rate debt included the following senior notes bearing interest monthly at  maturing in  senior notes which bear interest semiannually at fixed rates ranging from to  maturing in through  fixed rate mortgages and industrial development revenue bonds bearing interest from to  maturing in through  and unsecured term notes with stated rates of to  maturing in and the fair value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair value of our million of senior notes is approximately million 
based upon the respective rates and prepayment provisions of our remaining fixed interest rate senior notes and mortgages at may   the carrying amounts of such debt approximates fair value 
the variable interest rate debt and fixed interest rate debt outstanding as of may  matures as follows in thousands thereafter total variable interest rate    fixed interest rate        total debt        we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at may  on may   we terminated a swap agreement that had effectively converted million of our borrowings under revolving credit agreements from floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of the swap on the date of the termination was a liability of million 
the remaining loss in other comprehensive income at may  of million will be reclassified into earnings as interest expense through november   the remaining life of the original hedge  as interest payments affect earnings 
we expect to reclassify approximately million of loss into earnings during fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  insurance reserves  carrying value of investments in long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we review long lived assets  including fixed assets and goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during fiscal  we recorded a before tax impairment charge of million related to our two imax r theatre screens 
o we sponsor an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plan covering certain employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of pension expense recorded by us 
o we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation and general liability claims utilizing a retroactive insurance policy 
under this policy  we are responsible for all claims up to our stop loss limitation of  it is not uncommon for insurance claims of this type to be filed months or even years after the initial incident may have occurred 
it also can take many months or years before some claims are settled 
as a result  we must estimate our potential insurance liability based upon several factors  including historical trends  our knowledge of the individual claims and likelihood of success  and our insurance carrier s judgment regarding the reserves necessary for individual claims 
actual claim settlements may differ from our estimates
