item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
when used in this discussion  the words believes  anticipated  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth elsewhere in this report 
please see important factors regarding forward looking statements  below 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assum ptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to arrangements with extended payment terms  product returns  bad debts  income tax provisions and legal contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and bad debt we recognize revenues from long term research and development agreements subcontracted for the us government when services are rendered 
we recognize revenues in respect of products when  among other things  we have delivered the goods being purchased and we believe collectibility to be reasonably assured 
our provision for returns is based on our past experience 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and we require collateral as deemed necessary 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those accounts that we have determined to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  and this might cause a revision of recognized revenues 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory write offs and write down provisions are provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items or technologi cal obsolescence 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are primarily based upon forecasted demand for our products  and any change to the reserves arising from forecast revisions would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
subsequent developments on january  we issued and sold to grenville finance ltd  for an aggregate purchase price of  an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
on january  we issued and sold to special situations private equity fund  lp  special situations fund iii  lp  special situations technology fund  lp and special situations cayman fund  lp  for an aggregate purchase price of  an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
our total cash on hand immediately subsequent to these offerings was approximately million 
in march  we demonstrated our zinc air electric bus in a public demonstration in washington  dc  on capitol hill  with the participation of certain members of the united states senate 
general during  we accelerated our efforts to further develop  commercialize and market our disposable instant power zinc air chargers and batteries for cellular phones and pdas 
we also introduced several new devices  including a line of disposable  ready to use back up batteries for popular models of camcorders and digital cameras under our instant power brand 
these products use the proprietary high rate primary zinc air technology that we developed for use in portable electronic devices 
we also focused during the past year on expanding the distribution channels for our products  in order to continue the transition from a research and development company to a global consumer goods company  and on expanding the range of products that we offer 
our line of existing products now includes batteries for nokia phones  and chargers with smartcords for various series and models of nokia  motorola  ericsson  panasonic  siemens  samsung  audiovox  nextel  mitsubishi  sagem and philips cellphones  models of pocketpc  palm  handspring  sony  hp  casio and compaq pdas and novatel wireless modems 
during  we continued to increase our marketing development with respect to our instant power line  particularly in the united states  where we received orders from eleven and radioshack  canada  where we received orders from radioshack canada  germany  where we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with respect to our chargers with dnt gmbh  and the uk  where we received initial orders from orange uk 
as of the end of  our products were being carried by retailers in the us  the us  australia  canada  germany  italy  spain and israel 
while we have successfully marketed our products to retailers  certain of our customers have indicated to us in response to a dramatic slowdown in sales of cellular phone accessories particularly aggravated since september th  as well as in retail in general  that we would benefit from educating consumers and retail sales personnel as to the advantages of disposable chargers and batteries for cellphones and pdas 
we have begun addressing this need  both on our own and in cooperative programs with certain of our retailers  through a merchandizing campaign  as well as through in store merchandizing and training programs 
our zinc air cells are produced using a custom designed  high capacity automatic line designed  engineered and custom built for our needs 
during  we continued to invest in strengthening our intellectual property position 
we have unexpired us patents and corresponding european patents issued covering general aspects and various applications of our zinc air technology 
we also have more than new applications filed  focusing specifically on instant power chargers and batteries for consumer electronic devices and cellphones 
our electric vehicle division is continuing its american all electric transit bus development project  subcontracted by the federal transit administration fta 
we successfully completed phase i of the fta program in june  and are now engaged in phase ii of the program  which focuses on conducting evaluation of the system and vehicle performance  including track testing and limited on road demonstrations  enhancing the all electric propulsion system developed in phase i  including incorporating ultracapacitors and associated interface controls  and testing and evaluating the zinc air fuel cell system 
in august  we announced that we had successfully completed the performance testing of our zinc air electric bus 
in the final performance test  the bus was driven a record breaking total of miles  more than of them under the rigorous stop and go driving conditions of the society of automotive engineers central business district cbd cycle  and with a load simulating of the passenger payload for which the bus was designed 
the bus was designed to be driven for miles on the cbd cycle with a passenger load 
the most recent testing took place at rome  new york  on a taxiway of the former griffiss air force base  and included evaluation of constant speed driving and acceleration tests 
we conducted the first public on road demonstration drives of our zinc air electric bus on the streets of las vegas  nevada on november  to conclude the first milestone of our phase agreement with the fta to demonstrate and evaluate the all electric zinc air transit bus 
our defense and security products division is continuing with the production of zinc air fuel cell packs for the us army s communications electronics command cecom 
the volt  watt hour battery pack for battlefield power  which is based on our zinc air fuel cell technology  is approximately the size and weight of a notebook computer 
the battery is based on a new generation of lightweight  ampere hours cells developed by us for both military and future commercial products with high energy requirements 
additionally  the defense and security products division is continuing with the introduction of the new emergency lights for the marine life jackets market 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in the sources and amounts of our revenues and expenses  and we believe that the following comparisons of results of operations for the periods presented do not necessarily provide a meaningful indication of our development 
during these periods  we have received periodic lump sum payments relating to licensing and other revenues from our strategic partners  which have been based on the achievement of certain milestones  rather than ratably over time 
our expenses have been based upon meeting the contractual requirements under our agreements with various strategic partners and  therefore  have also varied according to the timing of activities  such as the need to provide prototype products and to establish and engineer refueling and regeneration facilities 
our research and development expenses have been offset  to a limited extent  by the periodic receipt of research grants from israel s office of the chief scientist 
we expect that  because of these and other factors  including general economic conditions and delays due to legislation and regulatory and other processes and the development of competing technologies  future results of operations may not necessarily be meaningfully compared with those of current and prior periods 
thus  we believe that period to period comparisons of its past results of operations should not necessarily be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of chargers and batteries for portable electronic devices  components of the electric fuel electric vehicle system  including refueling and electric fuel services and defense and safety products that we manufacture  as well as from licensing rights to our technology to third parties  there can be no assurance that we will ever derive such revenues or achieve profitability 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
further  we believe that the operations of efl s subsidiaries are an integral part of the israeli operations 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  a decrease of  during  we recognized revenues from the sale of consumer batteries  lifejacket lights and portable high power zinc air fuel cell packs for military use 
we also recognized revenues from subcontracting fees received in connection with the united states department of transportation dot program which began in and  after we completed phase i in july of  was extended in the fourth quarter of we participate in this program as a member of a consortium seeking to demonstrate the ability of the electric fuel battery system to power a full size  all electric transit bus 
the total program cost of phase ii is approximately million  of which will be covered by the dot subcontracting fees 
subcontracting fees cover less than all of the expenses and expenditures associated with our participation in the program 
we also received electric vehicle revenues during from our german consortium efrb project 
in  we derived revenues principally from the sale of lifejacket lights and consumer batteries 
additionally  we also recognized revenues from activities related to the dot program 
in  revenues were million for the instant power division compared to million in  a decrease of  or   for the electric vehicle division compared to  in  an increase of  or and million for the defense and security products division formerly known as the defense and safety products division compared to  in  an increase of  or 
cost of revenues and gross loss 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was the result of increased number of units produced in  as well as a mark down and write off of certain inventory as a result of price reductions 
gross loss was million during  compared to  during  an increase of million 
research and development expenses  net 
research and development expenses less royalty bearing grants for were million  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
research and development expenses were reduced by  during as a result of recognition of grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade 
our research and development grant applications have been approved by the research committee of the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade 
as a result  royalty bearing grants of  from the chief scientist were recognized during compared to  in  a decrease of  or to offset research and development expenses 
in addition  of royalty bearing grants from the bird foundation were recognized during compared to  in 
research and development expenses and cost of operations related to instant power and security applications are expected to continue to increase for  as we intensify our efforts in these new areas 
direct expenses for our three divisions for the fiscal year ended december  were million for the instant power division million in  an increase of million  or   for the electric vehicle division  in  an increase of  or  and million for the defense and security products division million in  an increase of  or 
the increase of expenses in the electric vehicle division and the instant power division was the result of progress that was made in phase ii of the fta program and the german program  and an increased number of units produced in our instant power division 
net costs of fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation at december  in the instant power  electric vehicle and defense and security products divisions were million   and  respectively 
selling expenses 
selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expenses in the instant power division 
we expect further increases in selling expenses  particularly with respect to marketing expenses  as we continue to market our products to consumers and expand the applications for our technology 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
financial income 
financial income  net of interest expenses and exchange differentials  totaled approximately  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to lower interest rates and lower balances of invested funds as a result of our use of the proceeds of private placements of our securities conducted in may and november  which was only partially offset by income from the proceeds of private placements of our securities conducted in may  november and december  as well as a decrease in interest income from certain shareholder loans 
income taxes 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
taxes in these entities incurred in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
net loss 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was the result of an increase in revenues from the instant power division that resulted from increased marketing of our instant power batteries for cellular phones  an increase that was only partly offset by the completion of phase i of the fta program and the concomitant drop off in revenues in the electric vehicle division attributable to that program 
during  we recognized revenues from the sale of lifejacket lights and sale of consumer batteries 
we also recognized revenues from subcontracting fees received in connection with the united states department of transportation dot program which began in and  after we completed phase i in july of  was extended in the fourth quarter of we participate in this program as a member of a consortium seeking to demonstrate the ability of the electric fuel battery system to power a full size  all electric transit bus 
the total program cost of phase ii is approximately million  of which will be covered by the dot subcontracting fees 
subcontracting fees cover less than all of the expenses and expenditures associated with our participation in the program 
in  we derived revenues principally from the sale of lifejacket lights and consumer batteries 
additionally  we also recognized revenues from activities related to the dot program 
in  revenues were million for the instant power division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  million for the electric vehicle division compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  and million for the defense and safety division compared to million in  an increase of million  or research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
research and development expenses and cost of revenues totaled million during  compared with million during an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in operations and engineering costs related to new product development  and the ramping up of our automated production line 
in  we believed that  given our stage of development  it was not yet meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
we did distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues in in addition to the increase in the overall research and development expenses in  the internal division of expenses also changed between and this was principally attributable to a reduction of expenses related to electric vehicle battery development 
this overall reduction was partially offset by significant increases in the costs associated with consumer product development and the production of increased quantities of lifejacket lights in the defense and safety division 
research and development expenses were reduced by million during as a result of recognition of grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade and the bird foundation 
our research and development grant applications have been approved by the research committee of the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade 
as a result  royalty bearing grants of  from the chief scientist were recognized during compared to  in  a decrease of  or to offset research and development expenses 
in addition   of royalty bearing grants from the bird foundation were recognized during compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses and cost of operations related to instant power and defense and safety applications are expected to continue to increase for  as we intensify our efforts in these new areas 
direct expenses for our three divisions for the fiscal year ended were million for the instant power division million in  an increase of million  or  million for the electric vehicle division million in  a decrease of million  or  and million for the defense and safety division million in  a decrease of million  or 
the shift in expenses from the electric vehicle division to the instant power division was the result of the completion of phase i of the fta program and the increased marketing of our instant power batteries for cellular phones  as discussed above 
net costs of fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation at december  in the instant power  electric vehicle and defense and safety divisions were million  million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expenses in the instant power division during we expect additional increases in selling  general and administrative expenses during  particularly relating to marketing expenses in consumer battery applications  as we continue to expand the applications for our technology 
financial income 
financial income  net of interest expense  exchange differentials  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or  due primarily to higher balances of invested funds as a result of the deposit of the proceeds of private placements of our securities conducted in income taxes 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
taxes in these entities incurred in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
net losses 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared with a net loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  compared with million as of december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in cash was primarily the result of the private placements of our securities described below 
we used available funds in primarily for continued research and development expenditures  and other working capital needs 
we increased our investment in fixed assets by million during the year ended december   primarily in the instant power division 
our fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
our israeli subsidiary efl presently has a line of credit with the first international bank of israel ltd 
fibi of up to  secured by such security as we and the bank shall agree upon from time to time 
this credit facility imposes financial and other covenants on efc and efl 
as of december   the bank had issued letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling approximately  during  certain of our employees exercised options under our registered employee stock option plan 
the proceeds to us from the exercised options are approximately  on november  we issued and sold to orsay services inc  for an aggregate purchase price of  an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
on december  we issued and sold to vertical ventures international  for an aggregate purchase price of  an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
we have no long term debt outstanding  and we are using our cash reserves and revenues from operations primarily to continue development of chargers and batteries for consumer electronic devices  as well as to participate in the fta electric vehicle program 
furthermore  in the third quarter of  we established a commercial production line and we are preparing for market penetration of our new instant power zinc air chargers and batteries for several models of cellular telephones and pdas 
approximately of the stock of our israeli based subsidiary efl is now owned directly  indirectly or by application of certain attribution rules by four united states citizens 
if at any time in the future  more than of either i the voting power of our stock  or ii the total value of our stock  is held or deemed to be held by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of our stock who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company stock ownership test under the internal revenue code and we could be subject to additional us taxes on any undistributed foreign personal holding company income of efl 
for  efl had no income which would qualify as undistributed foreign personal holding company income 
however  no assurance can be given that in the future efl will not have income that qualifies as undistributed foreign personal holding company income 
we believe that our present cash position and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements through the next year 
we are seeking additional funding  including through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain any such additional funding 
if additional funding is not secured  we intend to further modify  reduce  defer or eliminate certain of our anticipated future commitments and or programs  in order to continue future operations 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations historically  the majority of our revenues have been in us dollars 
the united states dollar cost of our operations in israel  with regard to expenses incurred in nis  is influenced by the extent to which an increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the past two years  inflation in israel has been more than fully compensated by the devaluation of the nis and  accordingly  the dollar cost of our nis expenses has decreased 
even if the recent trend is reversed as was the case in previous years  we do not believe that continuing inflation in israel or delays in the devaluation of the nis are likely to have a material adverse effect on us  except to the extent that such circumstances have an impact on israel s economy as a whole 
in the years ended december   and  the annual rates of inflation in israel were  and  respectively  compared to the devaluation of the nis against the dollar during such periods of  and  respectively 
effective corporate tax rate our production facilities in israel have been granted approved enterprise status under the israel law for encouragement of capital investments   and consequently are eligible for certain tax benefits for seven to ten years after they first generate taxable income provided the maximum period as prescribed by law has not elapsed 
we have elected to receive a grant of funds together with a reduced tax rate for the aforementioned period 
efl s effective corporate tax rate may be affected by the classification of certain items of income as being approved income for purposes of the approved enterprise law  and hence subject to a lower tax rate to  depending on the extent of foreign ownership of efl presently than is imposed on other forms of income under israeli law presently 
the effective tax upon income we distribute to our stockholders would be increased as a result of the withholding tax imposed upon dividends distributed by efl to efc  resulting in an overall effective corporate tax rate of approximately for income arising from efl s approved enterprises and regarding other income 
efc and efl have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december   and and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities paid in  and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that are available to offset future taxable income  expiring primarily in  and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income 
important factors regarding forward looking statements the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we have had a history of losses and may incur future losses 
we were incorporated in and began our operations in we have funded our operations principally from funds raised in each of the initial public offering of our common stock in february  the offering of our common stock in february  a private placement of our common stock in october  and placements of our common stock in december  january  may and november  may  october and december  and january  funds from licensing arrangements  research contracts and supply contracts  funds received under research and development grants from the government of israel  and sales of instant power batteries  instant power chargers  and lifejacket lights 
we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december     and  and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in these losses may increase as we expand our research and development activities and establish production facilities  and these losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability or that our business will continue to exist 
additionally  because we do not presently meet the transaction requirements for filing registration statements for primary offerings of our securities on the simpler form s registration statement  raising capital through sales of our securities may be more difficult in the future than it has been in the past 
we need significant amounts of capital to operate and grow our business 
we require substantial funds to conduct the necessary research  development and testing of our products  to establish commercial scale manufacturing facilities  and to market our products 
in order to satisfy existing orders of batteries in commercial quantities  we need to implement our automated production line and  in the future  may need to upgrade or expand our automated production line to satisfy future orders 
we plan to expand both sales and production activities  which will require additional funding 
we continue to seek additional funding  including through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain any such additional financing in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  stockholders may incur further dilution 
if additional funding is not secured  we will have to modify  reduce  defer or eliminate parts of our anticipated future commitments and or programs 
we cannot assure you of market acceptance of our products 
in  we began commercial deliveries of our cellphone battery and charger products  and in we expanded our product line to include chargers for pdas and batteries for digital cameras and camcorders 
however  our products have not yet been widely accepted by the consumer products market for this application 
furthermore  while we have developed chargers for several models of cellphones and pdas and batteries for several models  we do not have such products for many models 
we cannot assure you that the electric fuel battery or charger will be competitive either in terms of price or performance or that we will be able to sell our batteries or chargers in commercial quantities 
while we have successfully marketed our products to retailers  certain of our customers have indicated to us in response to a dramatic slowdown in sales of cellular phone accessories particularly aggravated since september th  as well as in retail in general  that we would benefit from educating consumers and retail sales personnel as to the advantages of disposable chargers and batteries for cellphones and pdas 
our cellphone and pda chargers  our batteries for cellphones  digital cameras and camcorders  and a signal light powered by water activated batteries for use in life jackets and other rescue apparatus are the only commercial products we currently have available for sale 
significant resources will be required to develop and produce additional consumer products on a commercial scale 
additional development will also be necessary in order to commercialize our technology and each of the components of the electric fuel system for electric vehicles and defense products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop  engineer or commercialize our products  technology or system components  or that we will be able to develop products for commercial sale or that  if developed  they can be produced in commercial quantities or at acceptable costs or be successfully marketed 
the likelihood of our future success must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the operation and development of a relatively early stage business and with development activities generally 
we believe that public pressure and government initiatives are important factors in creating an electric vehicle market 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient public pressure or that further legislation or other governmental initiatives will be enacted  or that current legislation will not be repealed  amended  or have its implementation delayed 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that even if an electric fuel vehicle market develops  a different form of zero emission or low emission vehicle will dominate the market 
in addition  we cannot assure you that other solutions to the problem of containing emissions created by internal combustion engines will not be invented  developed and produced 
any other solution could achieve greater market acceptance than electric vehicles 
the failure of a significant market for electric vehicles to develop would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize this aspect of our technology 
even if a significant market for electric vehicles develops  there can be no assurance that our technology will be commercially competitive within that market 
we will need to develop the experience to manufacture our products in commercial quantities and at competitive prices 
we currently have limited experience in manufacturing in commercial quantities and have  to date  produced only limited quantities of components of the batteries for electric vehicles 
in order for us to be successful in the commercial market  our products must be manufactured to meet high quality standards in commercial quantities at competitive prices 
the development of the necessary manufacturing technology and processes will require extensive lead times and the commitment of significant amounts of financial and engineering resources  which may not be available to us 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop this technology or these processes 
moreover  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement the quality control measures necessary for commercial manufacturing 
the price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may change rapidly in the future 
the following factors  among others  may cause significant volatility in our stock price 
announcements by us  our competitors or our customers  
the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by us or our competitors  
changes in the perceived ability to commercialize our technology compared to that of our competitors  
rumors relating to our competitors or us  
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  and 
general market or economic conditions 
if our shares were to be delisted  our stock price might decline further and we might be unable to raise additional capital 
one of the continued listing standards for our stock on the nasdaq national market is the maintenance of a bid price 
while our stock price has never gone below per share  it has recently closed as low as per share  and traded as low as per share 
if our bid price were to go and remain below for consecutive business days  nasdaq could notify us of our failure to meet the continued listing standards  after which we would have calendar days to correct such failure or be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
we would also have the opportunity to appeal this notification  although there can be no assurances that this appeal would be resolved favorably 
there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq national market  we might apply to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  however  there can be no assurance that we would be approved for listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has the same minimum bid requirement as the nasdaq national market 
while our stock would continue to trade on the over the counter bulletin board following any delisting from the nasdaq  any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of  and the efficiency of the trading market for  our common stock 
also  if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public equity markets 
our field of business is highly competitive 
the competition to develop consumer batteries  defense and safety products and electric vehicle battery systems  and to obtain funding for the development of these products is  and is expected to remain  intense 
our technology competes with other battery technologies  as well as other zinc air technologies 
the competition consists of development stage companies  major international companies and consortia of such companies  including battery manufacturers  automobile manufacturers  energy production and transportation companies  consumer goods companies and defense contractors  many of which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours 
various battery technologies are being considered for use in electric vehicles  consumer batteries and defense and safety products by other manufacturers and developers  including the following lead acid  nickel cadmium  nickel iron  nickel zinc  nickel metal hydride  sodium sulfur  sodium nickel chloride  zinc bromine  lithium ion  lithium polymer  lithium iron sulfide  primary lithium  rechargeable alkaline and zinc air 
additionally  some manufacturers of primary alkaline batteries offer alkaline battery packs for cellphone users 
some of the components of our technology and our products pose potential safety risks which could create potential liability exposure for us 
some of the components of our technology contain elements that are known to pose potential safety risks 
also  because electric vehicle batteries contain large amounts of electrical energy  they may cause injuries if not handled properly 
in addition to these risks  and although we incorporate safety procedures in our research  development and manufacturing processes  there can be no assurance that accidents in our facilities will not occur 
any accident  whether occasioned by the use of all or any part of our products or technology or by our manufacturing operations  could adversely affect commercial acceptance of our products and could result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries 
any of these occurrences would materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
failure to receive required permits from or to comply with the various regulatory regimes we are subject to could adversely affect our business 
regulations in europe  israel  the united states and other countries impose various controls and requirements relating to various components of our technology 
while we believe that our current and contemplated operations conform to those regulations we cannot assure you that we will not be found to be in non compliance 
we have applied for  and received  the necessary permits under the israel dangerous substances law   required for the use of potassium hydroxide and zinc metal 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities 
our business is dependent on patents and proprietary rights that may be difficult to protect and could affect our ability to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
we hold patents  or patent applications  covering elements of our technology in the united states and in europe 
in addition  we have patent applications pending in the united states and in foreign countries  including the european community  israel and japan 
we intend to continue to file patent applications covering important features of our technology 
we cannot assure you  however  that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or  if patents issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any of our patents will not be challenged or invalidated or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor 
litigation  or participation in administrative proceedings  may be necessary to protect our patent position 
this type of litigation can be costly and time consuming  and this could harm us even if we were to be successful in the litigation 
the invalidation of patents owned by or licensed to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws  rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that foreign patent applications related to patents issued in the united states will be granted 
furthermore  even if these patent applications are granted  some foreign countries provide significantly less patent protection than the united states 
in the absence of patent protection  and despite our reliance upon our proprietary confidential information  our competitors may be able to use innovations similar to those used by us to design and manufacture products directly competitive with our products 
in addition  no assurance can be given that others will not obtain patents that we will need to license or design around 
to the extent any of our products are covered by third party patents  we could require a license under such patents to develop and market our patents 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we may not be successful in doing so 
in addition  competition is intense  and there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  in the event of patent litigation  we cannot assure you that a court would determine that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for those inventions 
if existing or future third party patents containing broad claims were upheld by the courts or if we were found to infringe third party patents  we may not be able to obtain the required licenses from the holders of such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain these licenses could cause delays in the introduction of our products or necessitate costly attempts to design around such patents  or could foreclose the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in patent infringement suits brought by others and in prosecuting patent infringement suits against infringers 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our customers  employees  consultants  strategic partners and potential strategic partners 
we cannot assure you that these agree ments will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we are dependent on key personnel and our business would suffer if we fail to retain them 
we are highly dependent on certain members of our management and engineering staff  and the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could adversely affect us 
we are especially dependent on the services of our president and chief executive officer  yehuda harats  and our chairman of the board of directors and chief financial officer  robert s 
ehrlich 
the loss of either of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are party to employment agreements with messrs 
harats and ehrlich  each of which agreements expires in  with an option on our part to extend to we do not have key man life insurance 
we are subject to significant influence by some stockholders that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
as of march   our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders and their affiliates collectively owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or prevent a change in control 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operating results will be impaired 
we are currently experiencing a period of development activity which could place a significant strain on our personnel and resources 
our activity has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
many of our management personnel have had limited or no experience in managing growing companies 
we have sought to manage our current and anticipated growth through the recruitment of additional management and technical personnel and the implementation of internal systems and controls 
however  our failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be subject to increased united states taxation 
we believe that efc and efl will be treated as personal holding companies for purposes of the personal holding company phc rules of the internal revenue code of under the phc rules  a phc is subject to a special tax on its undistributed phc income  in addition to regular income tax 
we believe that efc and efl have not had any material undistributed phc income 
however  no assurance can be given that efc and efl will not have undistributed phc income in the future 
approximately of the stock of efl was owned directly or indirectly by application of certain attribution rules as of march  by four united states citizens 
if more than of either i the voting power of our stock  or ii the total value of our stock  is ever acquired or deemed to be acquired by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of our shares who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company fphc stock ownership test under the internal revenue code  and we could be subject to additional us taxes including phc tax on any undistributed fphc income of efl 
we believe that efl has not had any material undistributed fphc income 
however  no assurance can be given that efl will not become a fphc and have undistributed fphc income in the future 
a significant portion of our operations takes place in israel 
the offices and facilities of our principal subsidiary are located in israel 
although we expect that most of our sales will be made to customers outside israel  we are nonetheless directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in that country 
accordingly  any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
historically  arab states have boycotted any direct trade with israel and to varying degrees have imposed a secondary boycott on any company carrying on trade with or doing business in israel 
although in october  the states comprising the gulf cooperation council saudi arabia  the united arab emirates  kuwait  dubai  bahrain and oman announced that they would no longer adhere to the secondary boycott against israel  and israel has entered into certain agreements with egypt  jordan  the palestine liberation organization and the palestinian authority  israel has not entered into any peace arrangement with syria or lebanon 
moreover  since september  there has been a significant deterioration in israel s relationship with the palestinian authority  and a significant increase in terror and violence 
efforts to resolve the problem have failed to result in an agreeable solution 
continued hostilities between the palestinian community and israel and any failure to settle the conflict may have a material adverse effect on our business and us 
moreover  the current political and security situation in the region has already had an adverse effect on the economy of israel  which in turn may have an adverse effect on us 
many of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
no assessment can be made of the full impact of such requirements on us in the future  particularly if emergency circumstances occur  and no prediction can be made as to the effect on the company of any expansion of these obligations 
however  further deterioration of hostilities with the palestinian community into a full scale conflict might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our employees  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any failure to obtain the tax benefits from the state of israel that we expect to receive could negatively impact our plans and prospects 
we benefit from various israeli government programs  grants and tax benefits  particularly as a result of the approved enterprise status of a substantial portion of our existing facilities and the receipt of grants from the office of the chief scientist of the israeli ministry of industry and trade 
to be eligible for some of these programs  grants and tax benefits  we must continue to meet certain conditions  including producing in israel and making specified investments in fixed assets 
if we fail to meet such conditions in the future  we could be required to refund grants already received  adjusted for inflation and interest 
from time to time  the government of israel has discussed reducing or eliminating the benefits available under approved enterprise programs 
we cannot assure you that these programs and tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
the government of israel has announced that programs receiving approved enterprise status in and thereafter will be entitled to a lower level of government grants than was previously available 
the termination or reduction of certain programs and tax benefits particularly benefits available to us as a result of the approved enterprise status of a substantial portion of our existing facilities and approved programs and as a recipient of grants from the office of the chief scientist could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our israeli subsidiary has granted a floating charge lien over all of its assets as a security to the state of israel to secure its obligations under the approved enterprise programs 
exchange rate fluctuations between the dollar and the nis may negatively affect our earnings 
although a substantial majority of our revenues and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in us dollars  a significant portion of our costs  including personnel and facilities related expenses  is incurred in new israeli shekels nis 
inflation in israel will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in israel  unless it is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the nis relative to the dollar 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our international sales  production and funding requirements 
our research  development and production activities are primarily carried out by our israeli subsidiary  efl  at its facility in beit shemesh  and accordingly we have sales and expenses in new israeli shekels 
however  the majority of our sales are made outside israel in us dollars  and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred in us dollars 
therefore  our functional currency is the us dollar 
please see impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  above and note b to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although we have a line of credit that may be affected by interest rate changes  given our level of borrowing  we do not believe the market risk from interest rate changes is material
