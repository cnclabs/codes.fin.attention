effective january   we changed our fiscal year end financial reporting period to a or week year ending on the last sunday in january 
we elected not to restate the previous reporting periods ending december as a result  the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year ended january  are and week periods  respectively  with the remaining quarters being week periods 
all four quarters of fiscal  and year ended january  are week periods 
restatement we conducted a review of our accounting records and financial statements in response to an inquiry from the sec 
based on the results of the review  we restated the financial statements and related disclosures for the first three quarters of fiscal year and for the fiscal years and all information  discussions and comparisons in this form k reflect the restatement 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying restated january  and january  consolidated financial statements as of and for the three years ended january  for additional information on the restatement  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements

our graphics processors are designed to be architecturally compatible backward and forward between generations  giving our original equipment manufacturers  or oems  customers and end users a low cost of ownership 
we have five major product brands geforce  nforce  geforce go  quadro and tnt the geforce family represents our desktop gpus 
we are recognized for developing the world s first programmable gpus  the geforce and geforce the geforce and geforce gpus are designed to deliver the highest performance and cinematic quality for interactive entertainment  digital image editing and digital video playback applications through the use of highly programmable processing elements 
the nforce and xbox igp and mcp are the industry s first highly integrated platform processors to incorporate a comprehensive set of multimedia capabilities  such as d  d  dvd  hdtv  dolby digital audio playback and fast broadband and networking communications 
our mobile product family  which consists of the geforce and geforce go gpus  are designed to deliver desktop graphics performance and features for multiple laptop configurations from desktop replacements to thin and lights 
the quadro family of workstation gpus consists of an extensive range of products for the high end  mid range  entry level  multi display d and digital content creation markets 
the nvidia tnt family of graphics processors delivers high performance d and d graphics at affordable prices  making them the graphics hardware of choice for a wide range of applications for both consumer and commercial use 
our entire product family provides superior processing and rendering power at competitive prices and is architected to deliver the maximum performance from industry standards such as microsoft s directd api and sgi s opengl api on windows operating systems and linux platforms 
currently  all of our product sales and our arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars 
we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
since the pc market is our core business  our business would suffer if for any reason our graphics processors do not achieve widespread acceptance in the pc market 
a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers and sales are highly concentrated 
we sell graphics processors to add in board and motherboard manufacturers  primarily asustek  and cems including celestica  mitac  micro star  sci and visiontek 
these manufacturers incorporate our processors in the boards they sell to pc oems  retail outlets and systems integrators 
the average selling prices for our products  as well as our customers products  vary by distribution channel 
our three largest customers accounted for approximately of revenues for fiscal sales to edom accounted for  sales to micro star accounted for and sales to atlantic accounted for of our total revenue for fiscal for fiscal  sales to edom accounted for and sales to celestica accounted for of total revenue 
for fiscal  sales to creative accounted for  sales to edom and sales to diamond  inc each accounted for and sales to asustek accounted for of total revenue 
although we have major customers  our end customers include acer  apple  compaq  dell  emachines  fujitsu siemens  gateway  hp  ibm  micron  nec  packard bell  sgi and sony 
as markets for our d graphics processors develop and competition increases  we anticipate that product life cycles in the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline 
in particular  average selling prices and gross margins are expected to decline as each product matures 
our add in board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year for the high end  typically based on spring and fall design cycles 
in order to maintain average selling prices and gross margins  our existing and new products must achieve competitive performance levels to be designed into new system configurations and must be produced at low costs  in sufficient volumes and on a timely basis  especially with respect to our new products 
we currently utilize taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  to produce semiconductor wafers and we utilize independent contractors to perform assembly  testing and packaging 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business 
in addition  cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory  which could harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations 
we may build memory and component inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major oems 
we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding write downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand 
a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results 
product returns or delays or difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income  which could harm our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs  revenue recognition  sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we have a relatively short operating history on which to base judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of sales and related cost of sales until the distributors and representatives resell the product 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized 
if market conditions decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on historical return rates and analysis 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our reserve consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we will have higher gross margins when products are sold 
tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended january  year ended january  year ended january  as restated see note as restated see note revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets acquisition related charges discontinued use of property total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income fiscal years ended january   january   and january  revenue revenue was billion in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal product revenues increased by from fiscal to  and from fiscal to the growth was primarily the result of increased sales of our graphics processors driven by the strong demand for our products in the pc  workstation and mobile laptop markets and the introduction of our graphics processors into the game console market 
revenue from sales outside of the united states accounted for and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
geographic sales are based on bill to address and this decrease in revenue from sales outside of the united states is primarily attributable to sales of the graphics and media communication processors used in the microsoft xbox product billed to microsoft in the united states 
revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign cems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers located in the united states 
although we achieved substantial growth in product revenue from fiscal to and fiscal to  we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods 
in addition  we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the products 
the declines in average selling prices of d graphics processors in general may accelerate as the market continues to develop and competition increases 
gross profit gross profit consists of total revenue  net of allowances  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from contract manufacturers including assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory provisions and shipping costs 
our gross profit margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold 
our gross profit margins were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit increased from fiscal to fiscal due to an increase in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin geforce graphics processors  partially offset by increased sales of the lower margin xbox graphics and media communication processors 
gross profit increased from fiscal to  primarily due to significant increases in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin geforce graphics processors  partially offset by declining profit margins in our older product families 
although we achieved substantial growth in gross profit in fiscal  and  we do not expect to sustain these rates of growth in future periods 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  cost of development tools and software  cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel  including certain employees hired from dfx in connection with our acquisition of certain of their assets as discussed below  a million increase associated with lab equipment  software licenses  maintenance fees and depreciation charges  a million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into our new headquarters and other expenses during the year 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to  primarily due to the addition of personnel and related engineering costs to support our next generation products  such as depreciation charges incurred on capital expenditures and software license and maintenance fees 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses  promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses  travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel and commissions  a million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into our new headquarters and other increases associated with general administrative activities  american red cross donation associated with the events of september   and travel and entertainment expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to  primarily due to costs associated with additional personnel  commissions on sales of the nvidia tnt and geforce families of graphic processors and bonuses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations and our sales 
general and administrative expenses are also likely to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations and to be affected by legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with our recent internal accounting review 
discontinued use of property discontinued use of property consists of write offs of million relating to our previous office space in santa clara  california 
since we relocated in june  we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
the write offs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease  including rental payments  capitalized leasehold improvements  and furniture and fixtures 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and intangible assets from the asset purchase from dfx 
the initial allocation of the purchase price was a million to workforce in place  amortized over two years  b million to patents and trademarks  amortized over five years  and c million to goodwill  amortized over five years 
additional consideration is potentially payable to dfx  subject to dfx satisfying certain conditions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  amounts allocated to workforce will be reclassified into goodwill and all goodwill will no longer be amortized beginning fiscal year these assets will be assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
acquisition related charges acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets of dfx 
these charges primarily consisted of bonuses for former dfx employees 
interest and other income expense  net interest income primarily consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and interest on our convertible debt 
interest income increased million from fiscal to due to higher average cash balances as a result of a million advance received from microsoft in connection with our agreement with microsoft and the receipt of million from our convertible subordinated note and common stock offerings  which both closed in october interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in october income taxes we had income tax expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased foreign income  which is taxed at rates lower than the statutory rates in the united states 
amortization of stock based compensation with respect to stock options granted to employees  we recorded deferred compensation of million in and  in the one month ended january  these amounts were amortized over the vesting period of the individual options  generally four years 
we amortized approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal deferred compensation was fully amortized in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of million from the end of fiscal we historically have held our cash balances in cash or cash equivalents  such as money market funds 
in august  we began to invest in marketable securities 
our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions 
our investment policy requires the purchase of top tier investment grade securities  the diversification of asset type and limits on our portfolio duration 
operating activities generated cash of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the million in fiscal includes the million advance from microsoft 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to the draw down of the million advance from microsoft  offset by the increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
income tax benefit derived from the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association with employees exercise of stock options totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to a substantial increase in net income  offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated 
at january   micro star and edom accounted for approximately and of accounts receivable  respectively 
we may be required to write off bad debts in the future  which could harm our business 
our investing activities have consisted primarily of the purchase of certain assets from various businesses  investments in marketable securities  and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements for our new facility 
we incurred acquisition costs of million during fiscal  primarily due to purchase of assets from dfx 
there were no significant asset purchase transactions in the prior years 
we purchased marketable securities totaling approximately million during fiscal we incurred million  million and million in capital expenditures in fiscal  and  respectively  primarily attributable to our new facility as well as for purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and development 
we expect capital expenditures to increase as we further expand research and development initiatives and as our employee base grows 
the timing and amount of future capital expenditures will depend primarily on our future growth 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for software licenses  emulation equipment  purchase of computer and engineering workstations  future phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation  and tenant and leasehold improvements in our new headquarters facility 
in addition  we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of businesses or assets 
in april  we entered into leases for our new headquarters complex in santa clara  california 
our new complex comprises four buildings  representing approximately  total square feet 
the first phase of two buildings consisting of approximately  square feet was completed in june  and the second phase of one building consisting of approximately  square feet was completed in july restricted cash deposits of million were released upon completion of the first and second phases 
the last phase consisting of approximately  square feet was completed in february the million in restricted cash relating to letters of credit in place for the developer of the new facility is expected to be released in may the leases expire in and include two seven year renewals at our option 
the future minimum lease payments under these operating leases total approximately million over the terms of the leases 
financing activities provided cash of million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal on march   we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed  under certain terms and conditions  to develop and sell processors for use in the xbox video game console 
in april  microsoft paid us million under the agreement as an advance against processor purchases 
this advance has been fully utilized due to purchases made by microsoft through the quarter ended april  and microsoft is currently paying in advance for processor chipsets sold to it 
we have been engaged with microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the xbox chipset sold to them by nvidia 
these discussions and our agreement with microsoft contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on april  microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration 
microsoft has requested that the arbitration panel require that we supply chipsets in whatever quantities are ordered by microsoft 
microsoft has also asked for damages for alleged violations of the agreement and requested that the arbitration panel reduce chipset prices paid by microsoft 
we do not believe we have a requirements obligation to microsoft and we plan to submit our position to the arbitration panel shortly 
for sales of the xbox media communication processor  we have deferred revenue in an amount equal to the difference between the price being paid by microsoft and the price microsoft claims it should be paying 
this amount was approximately million as of january   the end of our fiscal we expect that we will continue to defer such amount on future sales of this processor until resolution of the matter 
common stock and convertible subordinated note offering in october  we sold  shares of our common stock and million of convertible subordinated notes due october  in a public offering 
proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
issuance costs related to the offering are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the term of the notes 
interest on the convertible subordinated notes accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on april and october of each year  commencing april  the convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after october  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
dfx asset purchase on april   we completed the purchase of certain assets of dfx  including patents and patent applications 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the cash consideration due at the closing was million  less million that was loaned to dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december   between us and dfx 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  following the closing  we are to pay dfx additional consideration in the form of stock equal to two million shares of nvidia common stock  subject to dfx satisfying certain conditions 
if the debts and liabilities of dfx can be satisfied for less than million and in accordance with the provisions as set forth in the agreement  under some circumstances  dfx could receive a post closing advance from us of up to million and this advance would reduce the number of shares of nvidia common stock potentially payable to dfx by up to one million shares 
in the event dfx cannot satisfy all of its obligations for million  nvidia will not be obligated to pay any additional consideration 
at this time  dfx has not satisfied all terms and conditions necessary to receive any contingent consideration 
consequently  due to the possibility of contingent consideration  the components of the final purchase price could differ from those presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the transaction is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  this purchase transaction has impacted our working capital in fiscal year and may have further impact if the additional conditions are met by dfx 
contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods contractual cash obligations total year years years after years in thousands interest on note obligation dfx post closing advance interest on capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations royalty and maintenance commitments other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations our convertible subordinated notes due possess a fixed interest rate of 
the amount of interest obligation assumes that the notes are held until maturity and not redeemed or converted into shares of common stock at an earlier date 
the convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after october  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date 
as such  actual future cash obligations may be significantly lower 
if the debts and liabilities of dfx cannot be satisfied  under some circumstances  dfx could receive a post closing advance from us of up to million and this advance would reduce the number of shares of common stock potentially payable to dfx by up to one million shares 
represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments at january  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  which could harm our business 
factors which could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 
for additional factors see business risk our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate  and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading new accounting pronouncements  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates  however  we reduce our interest rate risk by investing cash primarily in instruments with short maturities 
as of january   a sensitivity analysis was performed on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
however  because our debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized unless such securities are sold 
the average holding periods until maturity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately and days  respectively 
the principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio were million and for cash equivalents  and million and for marketable securities as of january  our convertible subordinated notes due possess a fixed interest rate of and are not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
exchange rate risk we consider our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
business risks in addition to the risks discussed in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our business is subject to the risks set forth below 
risks related to our operations our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate  and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 
many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period 
it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses 
as a result  it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially 
we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue  gross profit and results of operations 
factors that have affected our results of operations in the past  and could affect our results of operations in the future  include the following demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  the successful development and volume production of next generation products  new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products in accordance with oem design requirements and design cycles  changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers products  fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields  declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the us and international economies  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues  the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship  seasonal fluctuations associated with the pc market  substantial disruption in our suppliers operations  either as a result of a natural disaster  equipment failure  terrorism or other cause  supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers products  including memory devices  our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products  legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits  bad debt write offs  costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products  unexpected inventory write downs  and introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers 
any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business 
in addition  cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory  which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations 
we may build memory and component inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major oems 
we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding write downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand 
a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results 
we may be required to reduce prices in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts  our business could suffer 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
we need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed 
our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for the d graphics market 
our add in board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year  typically based on spring and fall design cycles 
accordingly  our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations 
this requires that we do the following anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of pc oems  cems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers  price our products competitively  and introduce the products to the market within the limited window for pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future 
the success of new product introductions will depend on several factors  including the following proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability of tsmc and any additional third party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner  the quality of any new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  and availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products 
our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third party foundries 
use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems 
new products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by pc oems  add in board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of d graphics 
in addition  we may not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the pc oems design cycles and market demand 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products 
our failure to successfully develop  introduce or achieve market acceptance for new d graphics products would harm our business 
our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 
as markets for our d graphics processors develop and competition increases  we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline 
in particular  we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our d graphics processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases 
as a result  we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins 
in order for our d graphics processors to achieve high volumes  leading pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our d graphics processor for design into their products  and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them 
we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion any new products 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that any new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers products  that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold 
as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for products increases  there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the development  introduction or volume shipment of our products 
we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we developed 
in addition  we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products 
failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices  reduced margins  and reduced demand for products or loss of market share 
in addition  technologies developed by others may render our d graphics products non competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory  any of which would harm our business 
we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 
products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released 
we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or lost revenue to correct any new defects in the future 
errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution 
as a result  our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution 
if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution  we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results 
the production and distribution of defective products could harm our business 
failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and or new products would reduce our gross margins 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design  which is developed largely by us  and process technology  which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 
the risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers  any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers 
this could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit 
our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business 
we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process 
in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall  our business could suffer 
failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively 
our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third party foundries 
use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems 
manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs 
we currently use 
micron process technology for the geforce  quadro  geforce  quadro dcc  xbox and nforce families of graphics processors  and we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
we are currently evaluating and qualifying the 
micron process technology for products that are estimated to begin commercial shipment later in our fiscal other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
we may experience similar difficulties and the corresponding negative effects 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we may be unable to migrate to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 
we may be unable to manage our growth and  as a result  may be unable to successfully implement our strategy 
our rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
as of january   we had  employees as compared to employees as of january  we expect that the number of our employees will increase substantially over the next months 
our future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis  as well as our ability to maintain effective cost controls 
further  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our strategy 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm our business 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
none of our officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement  and so our relationships with these officers and employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers  technical personnel or other key employees  particularly jen hsun huang  our president and chief executive officer  would harm our business 
our success will depend on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 
our reliance on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly  testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including the following unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including terrorism  which may delay the shipment of our products 
we also are subject to general political risks in connection with our international trade relationships 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 
currently  all of our arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
failure in operation or future enhancement or implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could harm our operations 
we are heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems to conduct our business 
system failure or malfunction may result in disruptions of operations and inability to process transactions 
our results of operations and financial position could be harmed if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to system operations or future implementations 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions include the following the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval  the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  a classified board of directors  and advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals 
on march   we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in a product under development by microsoft 
in the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock 
the provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability to grow our business and sell our products 
in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products  services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels 
for any previous or future acquisition or investment  the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and  ultimately  could impair our ability to sell our products difficulty in combining the technology  operations or workforce of the acquired business  disruption of our ongoing businesses  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel 
in addition  the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and common stock 
if the consideration is paid with our common stock  existing stockholders would be further diluted 
risks related to our partners we are dependent on a small number of customers and we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties 
we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated 
we primarily sell our products to add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems  which incorporate graphics products in the boards they sell to pc oems and system builders 
sales to add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems are primarily dependent on achieving design wins with leading pc oems 
the number of add in board and motherboard manufacturers  cems and leading pc oems is limited 
we expect that a small number of add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems directly  and a small number of pc oems indirectly  will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our business could be harmed by the loss of business from pc oems or add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems 
in addition  revenue from add in board and motherboard manufacturers  cems and pc oems that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  may not continue  or may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
our business may be harmed by instability in asia due to the concentration of customers who are located or have substantial operations in asia  including taiwan 
the people s republic of china and taiwan have in the past experienced strained relations 
a worsening of these relationships or the development of hostilities between the two could result in disruptions in taiwan and possibly other areas of asia  which could harm our business 
in addition  if relations between the us and the people s republic of china become strained  our business could be harmed 
while we believe political instability in asia has not harmed our business  because of our reliance on companies with operations in asia  continued economic and political instability in asia might harm it 
we rely on third party vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products 
in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  we rely on third party software development tools 
while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools  some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future 
for example  we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products 
the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from d graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us 
if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands  our business could suffer 
we may not be successful in producing the processors in volumes required for microsoft s xbox and  even if successful we may not achieve profit margins consistent with management s expectations 
our xbox igp and mcp are new and complicated processors 
both processors have increased in complexity and features from what was contemplated at the time we entered into the agreement with microsoft 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to produce these processors in the volume necessary and within the required time frames or that the payments for these processors will be consistent with profit margins achieved on our other products 
finally  there can be no assurance that the xbox program will achieve long term commercial success  given the high level of competition in the game console market 
if any of these risks occur  our business may be harmed 
we may not prevail in the arbitration with microsoft over pricing of the xbox chipset and even if we do prevail  there is no assurance that our business will not be materially harmed 
we have been engaged with microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the xbox chipset 
these discussions and our agreement contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on april  microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration 
microsoft has requested that the arbitration panel require that we supply chipsets in whatever quantities are ordered by microsoft 
microsoft has also asked for damages for alleged violations of the agreement and requested that the arbitration panel reduce chipset prices paid by microsoft 
we do not believe we have a requirements obligation to microsoft and we plan to submit our position to the arbitration panel shortly 
for sales of the xbox media communication processor  we have deferred revenue in an amount equal to the difference between the price being paid by microsoft and the price microsoft claims it should be paying 
this amount was approximately million as of january   the end of our fiscal we expect that we will continue to defer such amount on future sales of this processor until resolution of the matter 
the arbitration will be conducted in new york by a panel under the rules of the american arbitration association 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in the arbitration or continue to supply graphics and other processors for the xbox 
if we do not prevail  we may i be compelled to deliver xbox processors at reduced pricing  resulting in reduced gross margins  or a loss  on such processors  ii be required to reduce production and delivery of other products in order to satisfy obligations to microsoft  iii be required to pay significant damages to microsoft  or iv be subject to other remedies that could have a material adverse impact on our business 
even if we do prevail  there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially harmed 
we depend on foreign foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which would harm our business 
we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
our products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
we utilize tsmc to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent contractors to perform assembly  testing and packaging 
we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields  and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis 
these manufacturers may be unable to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirements 
we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and tsmc has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product 
tsmc fabricates wafers for other companies  including certain of our competitors  and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
because the lead time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product 
we believe that long term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with tsmc and any other manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand 
because of our reliance on tsmc  our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan  including the worsening of the strained relations between the people s republic of china and taiwan  or if relations between the us and the people s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events 
furthermore  any substantial disruption in our suppliers operations  either as a result of a natural disaster  political unrest  economic instability  equipment failure or other cause  could harm our business 
we are dependent primarily on tsmc and we expect in the future to continue to be dependent upon third party manufacturers to do the following produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields  deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis  and allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs 
our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc 
although our products are designed using tsmc s process design rules  tsmc may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis and or at an acceptable cost 
additionally  tsmc may not continue to devote resources to the production of our products  or to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
any difficulties like these would harm our business 
we are dependent on third parties for assembly  testing and packaging of our products 
our graphics processors are assembled and tested by siliconware precision industries company ltd  chippac incorporated and advanced semiconductor engineering 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
as a result of our dependence on third party subcontractors for assembly  testing and packaging of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business 
due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components 
any delays in delivery of our products could harm our business 
risks related to our competition the d graphics industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 
the market for d graphics processors for pcs in which we compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance  breadth of product offerings  access to customers and distribution channels  backward forward software support  conformity to industry standard apis  manufacturing capabilities  price of graphics processors and total system costs of add in boards and motherboards 
we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than our d graphics processors  or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products 
we may be unable to compete successfully in the emerging pc graphics market 
our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide d graphics solutions for the pc market 
our competitors include the following suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate d and d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as intel  silicon integrated systems and via technologies  inc or via  suppliers of graphics add in boards that utilize their internally developed graphics chips  such as ati technologies inc and matrox electronics systems ltd  suppliers of mobile graphics processors that incorporate d or d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati technologies  trident microsystems  inc and the joint venture of a division of sonicblue incorporated formerly s incorporated and via technologies  and companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and provide high end d solutions for pcs and workstations  including dlabs and ati technologies inc if and to the extent we offer products outside of the d graphics processor market  we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete 
we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 
we may not successfully compete with intel in the integrated chipset market 
it is projected by analysts that integrated chipsets are likely to become a majority share of the pc graphics market 
we have recently introduced and begun shipment of the nforce platform processor  an integrated d graphics chipset 
the nforce platform processor is initially designed to support microprocessors produced by amd 
intel is the dominant supplier of integrated d graphics chipsets and has commenced production of an integrated chipset for its pentium microprocessor 
intel has significantly greater resources than we do  and the nforce platform processor  or other d graphics products that we may introduce  may not compete effectively against intel s current chipset products or its future products  either in terms of price or performance 
in addition  due to the widespread industry acceptance of intel s microprocessor architecture and interface architecture  including its accelerated graphics port architecture  or agp  intel exercises significant influence over the pc industry and over companies developing products for such architecture 
any significant modifications by intel to the agp  the microprocessor or core logic components or other aspects of the pc microprocessor architecture could result in incompatibility with our technology  which would harm our business 
in addition  any delay in the public release of information relating to modifications like this could harm our business 
in addition to its influence over the pc architecture  intel has asserted intellectual property rights in various pc architecture interfaces 
for example  as a result of patents held by intel  it has asserted that companies wishing to develop a chipset compatible with the pentium microprocessor or similar microprocessors obtain a license from intel 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance  breadth of product offerings  access to customers and distribution channels  backward forward software support  conformity to industry standard apis  manufacturing capabilities  price of graphics processors and total system costs of add in boards and motherboards 
in september intel filed a patent infringement suit against via with respect to a via chipset for the pentium we do not have a license from intel for such a chipset 
we expect intel to continue to do the following invest heavily in research and development and continue development of integrated d graphics products  maintain its position as the largest manufacturer of pc microprocessors  use its intellectual property position with respect to the pc microprocessor and architecture to defend its position in d graphics  including the filing of patent infringement suits against competitors  follow business practices in its pc business  which strongly encourage use of intel integrated chipsets  increasingly dominate the pc platform  and promote its product offerings through advertising campaigns designed to engender brand loyalty among pc users 
our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 
our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins  which entails having our existing and future products chosen as the d graphics processors for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
our add in board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year  generally based on spring and fall design cycles 
accordingly  our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations 
our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 
the process of being qualified for inclusion in a pc oem s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature  which also could harm our business 
our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards 
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers  including intel and microsoft 
this would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time  our ability to achieve design wins could suffer 
risks related to financial and market conditions we are dependent on the pc market and the slowdown in its growth may have a negative impact on our business 
during fiscal  we derived most of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop pc market  from professional workstations to low cost pcs 
we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc market in the next several years 
the pc market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and significant price competition 
these factors result in short product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the life of a specific product 
a reduction in sales of pcs  or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales  could reduce demand for our products 
moreover  changes in demand could be large and sudden 
since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions 
in these cases  pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed 
it is possible that the recent slowing of the economy in the us and international regions  which has negatively impacted some pc manufacturers and led to some reductions in the demand for pcs  could lead to reductions in inventory purchases by pc manufacturers 
any reduction in the demand for pcs generally  or for a particular product that incorporates our d graphic processors  could harm our business 
the acceptance of next generation products in business pc d graphics may not continue to develop 
our success will depend in part upon the demand for performance d graphics for business pc applications 
the market for performance d graphics on business pcs has only recently begun to emerge and is dependent on the future development of  and substantial end user and oem demand for  d graphics functionality 
as a result  the market for business pc d graphics computing may not continue to develop or may not grow at a rate sufficient to support our business 
the development of the market for performance d graphics in business pcs will in turn depend on the development and availability of a large number of business pc software applications that support or take advantage of performance d graphics capabilities 
currently  there are only a limited number of software applications like this  most of which are games  and a broader base of software applications may not develop in the near term or at all 
consequently  a broad market for full function performance d graphics on business pcs may not develop 
our business prospects will suffer if the market for business pc d graphics fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected 
our d graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the pc market 
our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our d graphics processors for high performance d graphics in pc applications 
the market for d graphics processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products  often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results  changes in dynamic random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add in boards  as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions 
only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance  if achieved  is difficult to sustain due to intense competition 
since the pc market is our core business  our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future d graphics processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc market 
if we are unable to complete the timely development of or successfully and cost effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the pc market  our business would be harmed 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business 
the semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the following factors rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant average selling price erosion  fluctuating inventory levels  alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints  and variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
our stock price may continue to experience significant short term fluctuations 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are non company specific  such as the decline in the us economy  or due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has been initiated against the issuing company 
since february  multiple securities class action lawsuits and several derivative suits have been filed against us 
we expect that this litigation  whether or not resolved favorably  may result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our revenues and earnings 
any adverse determination in this litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
see legal proceedings and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading litigation for a description of this litigation 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
for additional information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
risks related to intellectual property  litigation and government action our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions  which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation 
the d graphics market in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions  and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions 
in addition  from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we expect that  as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases  and as competition in our markets intensifies  the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase 
if infringement claims are made against us  we may seek licenses under the claimants patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us  particularly by competitors 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products  which could reduce our revenues and harm our business 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products 
litigation against us or our customers concerning infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
we are currently subject to patent infringement suits  and we may be subject to patent infringement suits brought by other parties in the future 
we do not believe that current suits will have a material impact on our business or financial condition 
however  these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial damages 
our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property 
our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved 
in addition  any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property 
our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 
we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our graphics processors  and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products 
these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties  the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration 
if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms  our business could suffer 
future actions by the sec or other governmental or regulatory agencies and resolution of related litigation arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters could harm our business 
the sec staff informed us in january that it had concerns relating to certain accounting matters and that the sec along with the us attorney s office for the northern district of california had authorized a private investigation into such matters 
in accordance with the suggestion and advice of the sec staff  we launched a review of these matters 
on april   we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors had  with assistance from the law firm of cooley godward llp and forensic auditors from the firm of kpmg llp  concluded its review and determined that it was appropriate to restate our financial statements for fiscal  and the first three quarters of fiscal the audit committee has worked in cooperation with the sec and has provided the sec with extensive information and the conclusions of the review 
further actions by the sec or other governmental or regulatory agencies with respect to us or our personnel arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters may take significant time  may be expensive and may divert management s attention from other business concerns and harm our business 
in addition  a number of lawsuits have been filed against us following our announcement on february  of the internal review 
the defense of  and any resolution of such lawsuits may require significant expenditures and materially impact our business and results of operations
