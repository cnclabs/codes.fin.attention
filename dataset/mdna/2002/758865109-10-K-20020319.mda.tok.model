item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction general our company was formed in november to acquire  own and operate clusters of radio stations in mid sized and small markets 
the proceeds from our january initial public offering ipo and borrowings from our credit facility have given us the ability to increase our size significantly over the past two years 
we currently own and operate radio stations in markets 
during the year  we acquired radio stations in two new markets and two of our existing markets and disposed of three radio stations in one market 
we also disposed of one station during the first quarter of we have agreements to purchase four additional radio stations in two of our existing markets 
we began providing programming services to two of our pending radio stations in december  and to the remaining two radio stations in january the principal source of our revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on our radio stations for advertising 
as a result  our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations charge 
correspondingly  the rates are based upon a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic arbitron radio market reports 
in  our radio stations derived approximately of their net broadcast revenues from local and regional advertising in the markets in which they operated  and the remainder resulted principally from the sale of national advertising 
the financial results of our business are seasonal 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our first calendar quarter will be expected to produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter will be expected to produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
excluding gains on the sale or exchange of radio stations  we have historically generated net losses  primarily as a result of significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization relating to the acquisitions of radio stations and interest charges on outstanding debt 
prior to july   we historically amortized on a straight line method the fcc licenses and goodwill attributable to substantially all of our radio station acquisitions over a to year period 
during  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance on purchase accounting and the amortization of intangible assets  which will significantly reduce the amount of non cash amortization charges we recognize in our financial statements beginning in further information regarding this accounting change is included under effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
based upon the large number of acquisitions we consummated within the last two years  we anticipate that depreciation charges will continue to be significant for several years 
to the extent that we complete additional acquisitions  our interest expense and depreciation charges related to property and equipment and other intangible assets are likely to increase 
the performance of a radio station group  such as ours  is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the term broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before depreciation and amortization and corporate general and administrative expenses 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with 
table of contents generally accepted accounting principles  we believe that broadcast cash flow is accepted by the broadcasting industry as a generally recognized measure of performance and is used by analysts who report publicly on the performance of broadcasting companies 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income loss  net income loss  net cash provided by used in operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  the ability to provide popular programming  local market and regional competition  relative efficiency of radio broadcasting compared to other advertising media  signal strength and government regulation and policies 
from time to time  the markets in which we operate experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect our revenue 
we believe  however  that this impact is somewhat mitigated by our diverse geographical presence 
september  the effects of the september  terrorist activities had a significant impact on our business during the second half of at the time of the attacks  we decided the public interest would be best served by the presentation of continuous  commercial free coverage of the unfolding events on our stations 
the resulting loss of revenue  plus the economic uncertainty fueled by the attacks  on top of an already sluggish economy  resulted in reduced earnings during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
we were able to recover some of the lost revenues by rescheduling missed spots to later dates 
however some of the advertising spots were time sensitive  causing the revenue to be permanently lost 
additionally  revenues were affected as some advertisers marketing budgets were reduced due to the effect of the terrorist attacks upon their own revenues  and in some cases  advertisers made significant contributions to the september relief funds  further reducing their available advertising dollars 
while we don t expect to experience any further impact upon our revenues from the september  attacks  we cannot predict the effect upon our business of future terrorist attacks  if any 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
furthermore  future operating losses relating to discontinued operations can no longer be recorded before they occur 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting sfas 
table of contents in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas that addresses the recognition of asset retirement obligations 
the objective of sfas is to provide guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting sfas in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas  which became effective on july   eliminated the use of pooling of interests for all business combinations initiated after june  and also established specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separate from goodwill 
as we have historically reflected acquisitions using the purchase method  we do not believe sfas will have a significant impact on us 
sfas requires that a company no longer amortize the goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite life and also requires an annual impairment testing of those assets 
sfas must be adopted in the first quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after december  we will adopt sfas on january  we are currently evaluating the full impact that sfas and sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements  and believe that sfas could have a material impact on our financial statements  as amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets represents a significant expense for us 
amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles was approximately million  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and in addition  upon adoption  we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles and have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our financial position or results of operations 
when amortization of our indefinite lived assets ceases on january   due to the adoption of sfas  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets will no longer be assured within the company s net operating loss carryforward period 
we are in the process of assessing the effects of this pronouncement on the realizability of our deferred tax assets  and a valuation allowance could be required 
we have not yet determined the magnitude of this adjustment 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets and determining the recoverability of our long lived assets 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 

table of contents deferred tax assets at december   we had a deferred tax asset of approximately million  the primary component of which is our net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that at december   these carryforwards are fully realizable due to the existence of certain deferred tax liabilities  primarily related to broadcast licenses and goodwill  that under current accounting guidance  would be expected to reverse during the carryforward period  as well as a tax planning strategy that is available to us 
accordingly  we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
the need to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is reviewed quarterly  and if we were to determine that we would be unable to realize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as expense in the period such determination was made 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  or if laws change unfavorably  we could experience losses in excess of the current or deferred income tax provisions we have established 
for discussion regarding the pending adoption of sfas  see effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
long lived assets we have a significant amount of long lived assets  such as property  equipment  goodwill  fcc licenses and other intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we determine the recoverability of our long lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
numerous factors could impact the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset  including changing listenership patterns  increased competition in the market and future industry trends 
if we were to determine a permanent impairment had occurred  a charge would be made against income in the period such determination was made

results of operations following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years 
this commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
compared to in compared to  we experienced increases in net broadcast revenues and station operating expenses  due primarily to our year acquisition of radio stations in peoria  illinois and full year results for our year acquisitions in albany  new york and grand rapids  michigan 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the same categories due to the disposition in of our palmdale  california radio stations and our year dispositions of our flagstaff  arizona  mansfield  ohio  and victorville  california markets 
accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period  nor are they necessarily indicative of results in the future 
additionally  our results were impacted by the events of september   and we cannot predict the effect on our operations  if any  of any future terrorist attacks 
net broadcast revenues  station operating expenses  and broadcast cash flow net broadcast revenues  station operating expenses and broadcast cash flow in increased  and  respectively  over that of the period 
while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of any markets disposed of during those years 
these comparable results between and are listed in the table below by quarter  excluding the effect of barter transactions dollars in thousands 
net revenue broadcast cash flow number of markets number of stations first quarter first quarter change second quarter second quarter change third quarter third quarter change fourth quarter fourth quarter change 
table of contents during the second quarter of  same station broadcast cash flow decreased compared to the same period of the primary reason behind this decrease was increased operating expense  primarily in the area of promotional spending 
we believe that investment spending to promote our stations will provide positive long term revenue growth in our markets 
to a lesser extent  higher medical care costs and the new k match contribution increased operating expenses also 
during the third and fourth quarter of  the impacts of the september  terrorist attacks and the poor economy were clearly seen on same station revenue  compared to corporate expenses corporate general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million in to approximately million in beginning in the second quarter of  we began increasing the size of our infrastructure to meet the demands of supporting a public company whose stock is listed on a national stock market 
we believe our corporate structure is now adequate to meet the requirements of a public company  but future acquisitions could result in further expansion of our corporate infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately from this is due to a combination of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense for acquisitions that occurred at various times throughout the year  plus depreciation expense on approximately million of depreciable property and equipment additions attributable to station acquisitions in  and to a lesser extent  depreciation on approximately million of capital expenditures during interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately in compared to after removing the effect of approximately million of the interest expense  which was the result of the mark to fair market value of our warrant liability  interest expense increased approximately 
the increase is due to an average debt level of approximately million during compared to approximately million in average debt levels were lower in as we had paid down all our debt with proceeds from the ipo in january and subsequently did not incur any borrowings under our new credit facility until august the increase in interest expense was mitigated somewhat by significant decreases in interest rates during the weighted average interest rates were approximately and at december  and  respectively 

table of contents gain on the sale of radio stations on june   we completed the sale of our three stations in palmdale  california to concord media group  inc we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on this transaction  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  on august   we completed an exchange agreement entered into with clear channel broadcasting  inc  capstar radio operating company and their affiliates  in which we exchanged our eight stations serving the mansfield  ohio fm am and victorville  california fm am markets plus approximately million in cash for ten stations serving the grand rapids  michigan fm am and albany  new york fm am markets 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized a pre tax gain on the exchange of approximately million  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  income tax benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of  in this tax benefit represents a federal rate offset by state income taxes and the amortization of intangibles in excess of the amounts that are deductible for tax purposes 
we have cumulative federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  these loss carryforwards will expire in years through the utilization of a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes is limited pursuant to the annual utilization limitations provided under the provisions of internal revenue code section in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the years ended december  and  we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses  and a tax planning strategy available to us 
consequently  we determined that no valuation allowance was required at december  and during  we released the entire valuation allowance see compared to 
as a result of these events  no income tax expense was recorded in extraordinary loss on january   we paid off the outstanding debt from our old credit facility  accrued interest and related fees totaling approximately million using proceeds from our ipo 
this final paydown resulted in an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of income tax  from the write off of deferred financing costs 
compared to net broadcast revenues  station operating expenses  and broadcast cash flow in compared to  we experienced substantial increases in net broadcast revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expenses  and interest expense  due primarily to our year acquisitions of radio stations in el paso  texas  utica rome  watertown and albany  new york  grand rapids  michigan  and chico  california  as well as a time brokerage arrangement in st 
cloud  minnesota 
accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period  nor are they necessarily indicative of results in the future 
net broadcast revenues  
table of contents operating expenses and broadcast cash flow in increased  and  respectively  over that of the period 
corporate expenses corporate general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  reflecting the increased infrastructure required to support a public company whose stock is listed on a national stock market 
corporate personnel increased by approximately from to additionally  we moved into new corporate facilities in the third quarter of to accommodate the new infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization due to purchase price allocations of million of property and equipment  in addition to million of intangible assets from acquisitions in  depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately compared to from million in to million in additionally  for properties acquired in  intangibles were amortized over years rather than years for properties acquired in and prior years 
interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately in compared to as average debt levels in were approximately million  compared to average debt levels of million in average debt levels were lower in  as we paid down all our debt with proceeds from the ipo in january  and subsequently did not incur any borrowings until august  when we borrowed million under our credit facility 
the interest expense savings on the lower debt levels in were partially offset by increased commitment fees on the unborrowed capacity of our new credit facility 
gain on the sale of radio stations on august   we completed an exchange agreement entered into with clear channel broadcasting  inc  capstar radio operating company and their affiliates  in which we exchanged our eight stations serving the mansfield  ohio fm am and victorville  california fm am markets plus approximately million in cash for ten stations serving the grand rapids  michigan fm am and albany  new york fm am markets 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized a gain on the exchange of approximately million which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  income tax expense in  we recognized a gain of approximately million on the asset exchange from the clear channel transaction 
for tax purposes this transaction was treated as a like kind exchange resulting in a deferred tax liability pursuant to the provisions of internal revenue code section  of approximately million 
in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the year  we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses  and a tax planning strategy available to us 
consequently  we determined that no valuation allowance was required for and released the full valuation allowance 
as a result of these events  no income tax expense was recorded in in  we established a valuation 
table of contents allowance against our deferred tax assets following an assessment of the realizability of such amounts and consequently did not record any income tax credit on the million recorded pretax loss 
extraordinary loss on january   we paid off the outstanding debt from our old credit facility  accrued interest and related fees totaling approximately million using proceeds from our ipo 
this final paydown resulted in an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of income tax  from the write off of deferred financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was approximately million compared to approximately  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in compared to approximately million in the increase was due primarily to the operating activities of radio stations acquired in and in the latter part of cash flow used in investing activities decreased to approximately million in compared to approximately million used in the decrease is due primarily to fewer acquisitions of radio stations in compared to  and due to higher proceeds from the disposition of radio stations in cash flows provided by financing activities decreased to approximately million in compared to approximately million in during  cash provided by financing activities was the result of debt issued in connection with our acquisitions and a private placement of securities during the fourth quarter 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of net proceeds received from our ipo in january and borrowings under our credit facility  offset by related cash outflows of stock issuance costs and payments related to the redemption of our preferred stock and associated dividends 
additionally  our cash flows provided by financing activities was reduced by treasury stock purchases made under our stock buyback program during the year 
sources of funds in  our sources of cash totaled approximately million and were derived from a combination of borrowings under our credit facility  net proceeds from the sale of our stations in palmdale  california  cash provided from operating activities  and  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a private placement offering 
on january   we entered into a new credit facility  which is a million senior secured seven year reducing revolving facility  that also provided for an additional million on substantially the same terms  to fund future acquisitions  subject to terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
this additional million borrowing capability expired unused on january  this credit facility permits the borrowing of available credit for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes  including transaction fees and expenses  and to fund pending and permitted future acquisitions 
the credit facility also permits us to request from time to time that the lenders issue letters of credit in an amount up to million in accordance with the same lending provisions 
the commitment  and our maximum borrowings  will reduce over five years beginning in as follows in thousands 
table of contents december  commitment amount the million letter of credit sub limit also reduces proportionately but not below million 
mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions are also required from certain asset sales  subordinated debt proceeds  excess cash flow amounts and sales of equity securities 
under the credit facility  we are required to maintain a minimum interest rate coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum corporate overhead  and maximum financial leverage ratio and to observe negative covenants customary for facilities of this type 
during  we believe that the financial leverage ratio covenant will be the most difficult to satisfy due to the inclusion of the results of operations for the third and fourth quarters of in such calculation 
these results were severely negatively impacted by the september  attacks 
although our continued compliance with these financial covenants is subject to future operating results that we cannot predict with certainty  we have the ability to implement certain strategies to increase cash flow provided by operations or reduce cash flow used in investing and financing activities  if needed  to help mitigate this risk 
accordingly  regent expects that it will meet all of the credit facility covenants during  although there can be no assurances in this regard 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either a the higher of the rate announced or published publicly from time to time by the agent as its corporate base of interest or the overnight federal funds rate plus  in either case plus the applicable margin determined under the credit facility  or b the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin which varies between and depending upon our financial leverage 
borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at an average rate of as of december  we are required to pay certain fees to the agent and the lenders for the underwriting commitment  administration and use of the credit facility 
our indebtedness under the credit facility is collateralized by liens on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of our operating and license subsidiaries stock and is guaranteed by these subsidiaries 
as of march   we had borrowings under this facility of approximately million 
on june   we completed the sale of our palmdale  california radio stations to concord media group  inc and received net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings on the credit facility 
on november   we completed a private placement offering of  shares of our common stock at per share see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
 of these shares  sold to a venture capital fund related to one of our independent directors  and the associated cash proceeds  were held in escrow until february  pending confirmation from nasdaq that stockholder approval would not be required for such sale 
the proceeds from the private placement were used to partially fund the acquisition of our radio stations in lafayette  louisiana 
on march   we completed the disposition of substantially all the operating assets of wgna am  serving the albany  new york market  for million in cash to abc  inc on february   abc  inc 
began providing programming and other services to the station under a time brokerage agreement 
we anticipate recognizing a gain on the sale of approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale of the station will be used to pay down borrowings under our credit facility 

table of contents uses of funds in  we utilized our sources of cash primarily to acquire radio stations totaling approximately million  to pay escrow payments for pending acquisitions of  and to repay approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility 
additionally in  we funded capital expenditures of approximately million to upgrade our equipment and facilities  primarily at stations recently acquired  in order to remain competitive and to create cost savings over the long term 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in due primarily to scheduled expenditures at the radio stations we acquired in and the correlating increase in the size of our infrastructure 
pending sources and uses of funds on july   we entered into an agreement  as amended  to acquire by merger with the frankenmuth radio co  inc wzrz fm serving the flint  michigan market for approximately million  consisting of approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million 
we made an escrow deposit in in the amount of  to secure our obligations under this agreement 
the federal communications commission has approved the assignment of the station licenses  and we anticipate closing this acquisition in on january  we began providing programming and other services to the station under a time brokerage agreement 
we anticipate using borrowings from our credit facility to fund the cash portion of this acquisition 
also on july   we entered into an agreement  as amended  to purchase the outstanding stock of haith broadcasting corporation  owner of wfgr fm serving the grand rapids  michigan market for approximately million in cash 
we have made an escrow deposit in the amount of  to secure our obligations under this agreement 
in conjunction with the above stock purchase  on february  we purchased the option to buy wfgr fm from connoisseur communications of flint  llp for approximately million  paid by the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the federal communications commission has approved the assignment of the station licenses of wfgr fm  and we anticipate closing this acquisition in on january  we began providing programming and other services to the station under a time brokerage agreement 
we anticipate using borrowings from our credit facility to fund the cash portion of this acquisition 
on november   we entered into an agreement with covenant communications corporation to acquire substantially all of the assets of wrxf fm and wlsp am  serving the flint  michigan market  for approximately million in cash 
we placed in escrow  to secure our obligations under the agreement 
applications seeking approval from the federal communications commission for the assignment of the station licenses were filed in november  and are currently pending 
on december  we began providing programming and other services to the stations under a time brokerage agreement 
we anticipate using borrowings from our credit facility to fund this acquisition 
in march  we anticipate filing an omnibus shelf registration to offer  at our discretion  a variety of stock and or debt securities  with a maximum aggregate offering amount of million 
proceeds received from the above offering  if any  would be used to pay down borrowings under the credit facility and or fund future acquisitions 
we believe the cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our credit facility  and or various other sources of funds that may be available to us  will be sufficient to 
table of contents complete our pending acquisitions and to meet our requirements for corporate expenses and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  based on our projected operations and indebtedness 
after giving effect to all pending asset and equity transactions and the subsequent sale of wgna am  the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility would be approximately million with available borrowings of approximately million  subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements with related or unrelated parties  and no unconsolidated subsidiaries 
contractual obligations related to our credit facility and other long term debt  capital leases and operating leases are summarized below in thousands 
under the terms of our credit facility  our maximum borrowings will reduce over five years  beginning in based upon our outstanding borrowings at december   the payments detailed below under long term debt would be required to maintain compliance with our credit facility 
payments due by period one year two to four to contractual obligation total or less three years five years thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates 
it is our policy to enter into interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
as of december   we have not employed any financial instruments to manage our interest rate exposure 
based on our exposure to variable rate borrowings at december   a one percent change in the weighted average interest rate would change the company s annual interest expense by approximately
