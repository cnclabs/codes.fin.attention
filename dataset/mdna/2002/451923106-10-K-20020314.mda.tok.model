item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe the company s financial position and results of operations for each of the previous three years in the period ended december  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
general we are building a product driven oncology focused pharmaceutical company by developing and commercializing a portfolio of novel treatments for both early and late stage cancers 
we are leveraging our core competencies in clinical drug development to identify  develop and commercialize our proprietary product candidate pipeline 
our lead product  campath  has been approved in the united states and europe for treating patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is distributed by schering ag schering and its us subsidiary  berlex laboratories  inc berlex 
in addition  we have five oncology product candidates in clinical trials  three others that we are considering for further clinical development as well as several active preclinical programs 
to date  we have built this pipeline primarily through the licensing and acquisition of promising drug candidates 
in addition to our clinical development programs  we conduct drug discovery research  translational research and preclinical studies in the fields of angiogenesis inhibition  molecular receptor chemistry and targeted medicinal phosphonate chemistry 
campath was developed in a partnership with leukosite inc  formed in millennium pharmaceuticals  inc millennium acquired leukosite and leukosite s interests in the partnership two years later 
in december  we acquired millennium s equity interest in the partnership 
we acquired millennium s interest because we believe the transaction will have a positive impact on our income statement and will enable us to more effectively develop campath in other indications such as other leukemias  lymphomas and multiple sclerosis 
in addition  we will have the opportunity to enhance commercialization by co promoting campath in the us with our development and marketing partner  berlex 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit through december  of million 
our losses have resulted primarily from product development activities  including in licensing of products for which we pay fees  and related administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to product development and product royalty revenue for campath  interest income  and other miscellaneous income 
campath was developed in partnership with millennium pharmaceuticals  inc millennium through millennium ilex partners  lp the partnership 
most of the development of campath has been conducted by us on behalf of the partnership 
the partnership pays us for these services 
we have historically accounted for these campath development activities as follows o our operating revenue includes product development revenue we receive from the partnership  o our research and development expenses include all of the development costs for campath  which are largely offset by the partnership s revenue we receive  and o our actual share of campath sales and marketing expenses and development costs is reported as equity in income losses of research and development partnership 
our contract research organization cro business generates revenue by performing services for companies within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
the terms of our contracts vary  ranging from several months to three years  or completion of the project  and generally may be terminated upon notice of to days by our customers 
we recognize revenue with respect to our services either on a percentage of completion or fee for service basis as work is performed 
the cro business performs all of the development services for ilex products  however  our consolidated cro revenue does not include any amounts related to the services provided to ilex products 
in february  we announced our intention to transition out of the cro business 
we completed a pivotal clinical trial in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll for our most advanced product candidate  campath 
we submitted a biologics license application bla to the us food and drug administration fda for campath alemtuzumab in december the application was accepted for filing in february  and the fda returned a complete response letter to the partnership in june the partnership submitted a response to the fda in august in december  campath was reviewed by the ilex oncology  inc 
annual report on form k oncologic drugs advisory committee odac and was recommended for accelerated approval 
we received a class i response letter from the fda in february  indicating the timeframe for accelerated approval was being extended into the second quarter of campath received us regulatory approval for marketing in may additionally  the marketing authorization application for campath was accepted for review in april by the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea 
the application  which was submitted in late march of  was reviewed under the emea s centralized procedure  required for biotechnology products 
the emea s committee on proprietary medicinal products cpmp issued a positive opinion in march to recommend approval under exceptional circumstances of mabcampath tm  the trademark for campath in europe 
the european commission ratified the opinion and issued a marketing authorization in july under this authorization  the partnership have been granted a single license for marketing mabcampath in the member states of the european union and received national licenses in two additional countries  iceland and norway 
in august  the partnership licensed worldwide marketing rights except for japan and east asia for campath to schering ag 
in november  we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold million shares 
the number of shares sold includes the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option 
proceeds  net of offering costs  to the company from this offering were approximately million  which includes the reissuance of our  treasury shares 
the net proceeds of this offering will be used in the next two years to fund a portion of the acquisition of millennium s partnership interest in the partnership 
the balance of the net proceeds will be used to expand clinical trials and preclinical research  to fund research and development programs  for potential licenses or other acquisitions of complementary technologies or products  for general corporate purposes and for working capital 
on october   we entered into an agreement with millennium pharmaceuticals  inc to purchase millennium s interest in the partnership for a total purchase price of approximately million based on the net present value of the required cash payments  discounted at  our estimated incremental borrowing rate 
the terms of the agreement included an initial cash payment of million and an additional million in scheduled payments to millennium over the next three years  of which million may be paid with our common stock 
in march  we entered a definitive agreement to co develop clofarex  a nucleoside analog  with bioenvision inc we paid million upon execution of the agreement and may be required to make future payments in accordance with the agreement if certain drug development milestones are met 
in clinical studies  clofarex has shown promise as a potential new treatment for patients with hematological malignancies  including acute lymphocytic leukemia all and acute myelogenous leukemia aml  and in preclinical studies  for solid tumors 
we are taking the lead role in developing clofarex in the us and canada  where it will have exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights in exchange for an in licensing fee  milestone payments and royalties 
bioenvision will retain the lead role in developing the compound in europe and elsewhere  where it will have exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights and we will have rights to royalties 
in february  we acquired symphar and its research platform in targeted medicinal chemistry and nuclear receptor biology  which has led to drug candidates in several therapeutic fields  including cancer and bone disease  an important complement to our oncology pipeline 
the symphar acquisition  combined with our preclinical angiogenesis inhibition program in boston  gives us the strong capability to translate early stage research leads into clinical drug development programs 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired symphar for million  including million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
in july  we entered into an agreement with basf pharma basf for an exclusive  worldwide license of ilx  a synthetic pentapeptide analog of dolastatin 
we filed an investigational new drug ind application in late and expects to begin human clinical trials shortly 
we incurred million in license issue fees as of december   of which million was paid during the third quarter of  and million was paid in cash in the first quarter of we recorded a license fee expense accrual of million in and this amount was paid in january we may be required to make future license maintenance fees in either cash or common stock in accordance with the agreement if certain drug development and time based milestones are met 
in march  ilex services  inc signed a multi year services agreement with british biotech plc british biotech to provide contracted drug development services to complete the ongoing clinical development of british biotech s drug  marimastat  in north america 
ilex oncology  inc 
annual report on form k in march  we sold million shares of common stock at per share to selected institutional and other accredited investors in a private placement 
gross proceeds to the company were approximately million 
net proceeds to us were approximately million 
in september  ilex services sold million of its preferred stock initially convertible beginning in september  or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events  into  shares of our common stock to impath  inc in november  impath elected to convert its convertible preferred stock to shares of our common stock 
in july  we acquired convergence pharmaceuticals  inc convergence of boston  massachusetts  a privately held research based pharmaceutical company with an emerging portfolio of angiogenesis and dna repair inhibitors 
the terms of the agreement called for us to issue shares in exchange for convergence s assets  as well as potentially issue earn out shares  if certain development milestones are met 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired convergence in exchange for one million shares of our common stock 
the total aggregate purchase price was approximately million 
the first milestone for the earn out shares is defined as the initiation of treatment of the first patient following initiation of a phase i trial of one of the convergence compounds in the united states or europe which  according to the agreement  had to occur no later than december  the first milestone was met in the fourth quarter of the value of the common stock issued in connection with the achievement of the first milestone related to the acquisition was calculated using a fair value of per share 
this per share fair value represents the closing price of our stock on the date the first milestone was achieved 
this additional purchase price of approximately was expensed as in process research and development costs 
the second milestone for the earn out shares is defined as the initiation of treatment of the first patient following initiation of a phase ii trial of one of the convergence compounds in the united states or europe  which must occur no later than december  we expect to issue the shares in connection with the achievement of the second milestone in critical accounting policies we believe that our most critical accounting issues include revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts for which we use a percentage of completion method of accounting and the process of determining the amount of in process research and development obtained in an acquisition 
the percentage of completion accounting method is applied by our fee for service cro business 
approximately of total revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting during this method relies on the estimated total cost and revenues at completion  and we believe that dependable estimates can be made during contract performance 
management reviews these estimates periodically and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the revision is known 
if our business conditions were different  or we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements 
we are currently in the process of exiting the cro business and we expect our revenues from the cro and thus  under the percentage of completion method of accounting to decrease over the next year 
amounts recorded as in process research and development are based upon assumptions and estimates regarding the amount and timing of projected revenues and costs as well as the appropriate discount rates and expected trends in technology 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate revenue  development costs or profitability or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
the most significant and uncertain assumptions relating to the in process projects relate to the projected timing of completion and revenues attributable to each project 
the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for  and it should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  the notes thereto and other financial information beginning on page f of this report 
ilex oncology  inc 
annual report on form k results of operations december  and operating revenues total revenue decreased to million in  from approximately million in the decrease of approximately million  or  was due to our decision to discontinue our fee for service cro business 
this decision was announced in february we expect our revenue from contract research services to further decrease as we complete our existing contracts 
the increase in product development revenues of  reflects an increase in development revenue for campath in indications other than cll 
operating expenses total operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased to million in from approximately million in this increase of approximately million  or  is primarily attributable to a million increase in in process research and development costs associated with our acquisition of symphar in february and our acquisition of millennium s interest in the partnership in december also contributing to the increase in total operating expenses are the increases in research and development costs  licensing costs and general and administrative costs  partially offset by a decrease in the direct costs of research services 
we believe that our research and development costs will continue to increase in future periods as we expand our preclinical studies and clinical trials associated with developing our own proprietary products 
research and development costs 
research and development costs increased to million in  from approximately million in this increase of million  or  was due to increased development spending on our product candidates  particularly for clofarex  eflornithine and ilx additionally  research and development costs increased due to the acquisition of symphar  our drug discovery research firm in geneva  switzerland 
licensing costs 
licensing costs increased to million in from million in or an increase of million or 
the primary reason for the increase is a license fee expense accrual of million related to an exclusive  worldwide license from knoll ag basf pharma for ilx  a synthetic pentapeptide analog of dolastatin

general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs increased to million in  from approximately million in this increase of million  or  was due in part to our transition out of the fee for service cro business  and the corresponding transition of our internal resources to focus on new business opportunities  build strategic relationships and develop our proprietary product candidates 
the costs associated with these management and business development activities were previously included in direct costs of research services and are now reflected in general and administrative costs

special charges 
we incurred special charges of million in the first half of these charges included million in costs associated with the termination of our agreement with prn 
in july  we entered into a service agreement with prn to jointly market our ability to conduct clinical trials 
as part of our arrangement  we issued to prn  shares of our common stock in and the value of these shares was recorded as an intangible asset to be amortized over the term of the relevant agreement

as of december   we had incurred such an ownership change 
however  we do not believe that this change in ownership significantly affects our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards as of december   because the amount of the cumulative limitation based upon our current market capitalization during the carryforward period exceeds the total amount of nol and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of our capital stock  through development and licensing fee revenues provided by our collaborative partners under our collaborative agreements and through fee for service or participatory revenues pursuant to contracts with our cro clients
