item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies stated below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from service fees relating to our products  including installation  maintenance and training 
our revenue recognition policy follows sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we generally recognize product revenue from our end user and reseller customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
revenue from service obligations under maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically months 
we make certain sales to partners in two tier distribution channels 
the first tier consists of a limited number of independent distributors that sell primarily to resellers and  on occasion  to end user customers 
under specified conditions  we grant the right to these distributors to return a portion of unsold inventory to us for the purpose of stock rotation 
therefore  we defer recognition of revenue on sales to distributors until the distributors sell the product  as evidenced by a monthly sales out report that each distributor provides us 
the second tier of the distribution channel consists of a large number of third party resellers that sell directly to end users and are not granted return privileges  except for defective products 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and return policies which has been netted against net revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
if the historical data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future returns  these estimates would have to be modified  thus resulting in an impact to net revenue 
inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we perform a detailed assessment of 
table of contents inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
in recent quarters  demand for our products has been adversely affected by the downturn in the united states economy and reduced telecommunications and infrastructure capital spending 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be written down  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our operating margin in that period will be unusually favorable 
warranty reserves networking products can contain undetected software or hardware errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product upgrades 
our hardware warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to the end user and months from the date of shipment to channel partners 
upon shipment of products to our customers  including both end users and channel partners  we estimate expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrue the amount as revenue is recognized 
our determination of our warranty requirements is based on our actual historical experience with the product or product family  the frequency of new product introductions and product upgrades anticipated during the period  an estimate of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment 
we adjust these accruals at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied in calculating this accrual is appropriate  the assumptions used are based on estimates and estimated amounts could differ materially from our actual warranty expenses in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts in general and administrative expense when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends in the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asian region  excluding japan  to secure letters of credit prior to placing an order with us 
during the year ended june   we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts  reflecting the adverse economic conditions affecting our customer base 
while we believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is appropriate  a change in the financial condition of specific customers may result in further adjustment to our estimates of the recoverability of receivables 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance is established 
for fiscal and  we did not record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets because we believed the amount was more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we are unable to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to income in the period such determination is made 

table of contents purchase commitments currently  we have strategic partnerships with three contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products 
our agreements allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast provided by us 
we are contractually obligated to the purchase of long lead time component inventory that our contract manufacturers procure in accordance with the forecast  unless we give notice of order cancellation outside of applicable component leadtimes 
as of june   we were committed to purchase approximately million of such inventory over the next four months 
if actual demand of our products is below these projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments of long lead time components with our contract manufacturers 
as a consequence  we may then need to record a charge to cost of revenue to reflect the impact of such excess purchase commitments 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we may revise our estimates related to these pending claims and litigation 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
for further detail  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings 
first quarter fiscal on september   we announced that we expected revenue for the first quarter ended september  to be approximately million 
based on this revenue level  we expect to report a loss of approximately to per share for the quarter on a gaap basis 
results of operations net revenue net revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in revenue in the united states  as our business was negatively impacted by the cautious purchasing behavior of customers in the difficult economic environment during fiscal  offset in part by an increase in revenue from customers in japan 
the increase in net revenue for fiscal resulted primarily from a higher volume of sales due to an increase in market acceptance of our products 
sales outside of the united states accounted for  and of net revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in united states sales in fiscal as a percentage of total sales was primarily attributable to reduced sales within the united states in the first half of as a result of the events of september  sales within the united states in the second half of fiscal steadily increased as a percentage of total sales 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenue  although export sales may decline as a percentage of net revenue 
all sales transactions are currently denominated in united states dollars 
during fiscal  the united states economy experienced a rapid and increasingly severe downturn 
this adversely affected our product demand and made it increasingly difficult to accurately forecast future production requirements 
our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal will be adversely affected by the continuing weakness and uncertainty in the economies of the united states and other industrialized countries 
while we 
table of contents expect this economic downturn to continue for the remainder of calendar year  we cannot predict the extent  severity or length of this economic downturn in the united states or in the other geographic regions where we currently sell our products 
we expect to experience some erosion of average selling prices of our products due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and rapid technological change 
our revenue is derived primarily from sales of our summit  blackdiamond and alpine products and fees for services relating to our products  including installation maintenance and training 
the level of sales to any customer may vary from period to period  however  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
one customer  who is a distributor of our products  accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenue in fiscal and fiscal no customer accounted for more than of our net revenue in fiscal cost of revenue cost of revenue includes costs of raw materials  direct labor  manufacturing overhead and amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  and other costs related to warranty and contractual obligations 
net revenue less cost of revenue gross profit was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the related decrease in revenue  and the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in revenue 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal year the increase in gross margin in fiscal over fiscal resulted primarily from a shift in product mix and a decrease in the net charges related to contract manufacturers and other costs associated with the carrying value of inventory  including a benefit to cost of revenue in fiscal of million relating to products sold that were written off in fiscal this increase in gross margin in fiscal over fiscal was adversely affected by a significant increase in warranty expense 
during fiscal we experienced a higher than normal rate of warranty expense due to problems with various component parts within our products and our election  in some cases  to address those problems by replacing such products with new rather than refurbished replacements 
we continued to experience higher than normal rates of warranty expense in the first quarter of fiscal we intend to reduce these expenses in the future  however our gross margin will continue to be adversely affected until we have completed the implementation of operational changes designed to reduce these expenses 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to a million charge for excess and obsolete inventory  non cancelable purchase commitments and warranty expenses 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon our forecast of future sales 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past  we built inventory levels for certain components with long lead times and entered into long term commitments for certain components 
due to a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products that became apparent in the third quarter of fiscal  inventory levels  including non cancelable purchase commitments  exceeded our requirements based on our forecast of expected demand 
this additional excess inventory charge was calculated based on the inventory levels in excess of our forecast of expected demand for each product 
based on our future demand forecast  we do not currently anticipate that the excess inventory subject to these provisions will be used at a later date 
furthermore  we may be required to take additional write downs in the future related to excess inventory 
our gross margin is variable and dependent on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
some of the primary factors affecting gross margin include demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  and the mix of products sold 
our gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  increases in warranty expense  heightened price competition  obsolescence charges and higher inventory balances 
in addition  our gross margin may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  including the effects of our two tier distribution model 
any significant decline in sales to our resellers  distributors or end user customers  or the loss of any of our resellers  distributors or end user customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  an increase in distribution channels generally makes it more difficult to forecast the mix of products sold 
table of contents and the timing of orders from our customers 
new product introductions may result in excess or obsolete inventories  which may also reduce our gross margin 
furthermore  if product or related warranty costs associated with these new products are greater than we have experienced  gross margin may be adversely affected 
cost of revenue includes the cost of our manufacturing overhead 
we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations  and we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and repairs at our facility in santa clara  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to our contract manufacturers flextronics international  ltd  plexus corp 
and solectron corporation 
as part of our business relationship with mcms  inc  the predecessor in interest to plexus corp  in september  we entered into a million operating equipment lease for manufacturing equipment with a third party financing company  we  in turn  subleased the equipment to mcms 
due to the liquidity problems at mcms and its voluntary bankruptcy filing for protection under chapter on september   we recorded a charge of million related to the equipment lease in the first quarter of fiscal on january   mcms completed an agreement to sell a majority of its assets to plexus corp 
for million 
we expect to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturers as a result of volume efficiencies if and as volumes increase 
however  we do not know if or when such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain these price reductions could have a material adverse effect upon our gross margin and operating results 
sales  marketing and service expenses sales  marketing and service expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support and service functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
sales  marketing and service expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to lower aggregate sales commissions and a reduction of approximately people in our sales  marketing and support organization 
as a percentage of net revenue  sales  marketing and service expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this percentage increase was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  sales  marketing and service expenses increased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional sales  marketing and customer support personnel  increased sales commission expenses resulting from increased net revenue and increased promotional expenses 
service expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these increases were due to increased staffing and new programs for our distributors and resellers 
the rate of future spending increases in our sales  marketing and service expenses  if any  will depend on the pace of recovery in the market for networking products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal these increases were primarily due to higher payroll and related personnel expenses associated with the addition of new personnel  partly through acquisitions  to support our multiple product development efforts as well as non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this percentage increase was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this percentage decrease was primarily the result of an increase in our net revenue in fiscal we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increased professional fees and directors and officers insurance premiums 
from fiscal to fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the percentage increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue 
the percentage increase in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense  the hiring of additional finance  information technology  legal and administrative personnel and increased professional fees 
the rate of any future spending increases in our general and administrative expenses  if any  will depend on the pace of recovery in the market for networking products 
impairment of acquired intangible assets in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded in operating expenses asset impairment charges totaling million against certain acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
the acquired intangible assets and goodwill that were impaired originated primarily from the acquisitions of optranet in january and webstacks in march optranet s products were originally targeted at the building local exchange carrier  or blec  and multi tenant unit  or mtu  markets 
it was believed that  by incorporating optranet s technology into our alpine product family  we would be able to expand our presence in customer networks and give metropolitan service providers an advanced ethernet service provisioning platform for ethernet access over several transport systems 
we believed we would be able to exploit the synergies and growth opportunities of optranet s in process products due to their complementary nature to our strategy and compatibility with our products 
however  following the acquisition date  demand for optranet s products fell sharply  as the majority of optranet s targeted customers either entered into bankruptcy or dissolved 
based on industry analysis  the blec and mtu markets are not expected to recover in the next few years  and in the event that a recovery eventually occurs  blec and mtu service providers may likely require different solutions 
as of the impairment valuation date of march   the optranet products were repositioned to address the remote and branch office access needs of enterprise customers 
however  this secondary market has also slowed due to decreased information technology spending and has largely been addressed by competing products based on legacy technologies 
webstacks products were originally targeted at the e business and hosting facility markets 
we acquired webstacks in an effort to expand our ip services to provide robust layer layer switching solutions required for building high performance content aware networks 
we believed that we would be able to exploit the growth opportunities of webstacks products by complementing our layer product focus with high end layer layer networking devices 
however  demand for higher cost layer layer switches in these markets did not materialize  largely due to worsening economic conditions 
e business customers continued to rely on slower speed networking devices and host facilities have not yet grown to a scale that necessitates data transfer at gigabit speeds 
as of the impairment valuation date of march   the webstacks products were repositioned to address enterprise data center needs  including security products 
although this market has slowed since the acquisition date  based on industry analysis  we believe there continues to be potential for moderate growth in this market 
based on the foregoing impairment factors  we worked with valuation experts to perform asset impairment tests at the lowest operational level that had separately identifiable cash flows related to the webstacks and optranet intangible assets and goodwill 
the tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows over month periods for each of webstacks and optranet to the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
table of contents resulting from the acquisitions 
we found that the sum of the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the webstacks and optranet intangible assets and goodwill was less than their carrying value and thus we needed to record an impairment loss 
the impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the carrying values of such assets exceeded their fair value 
the fair value was calculated based on analyses of the discounted future cash flows for each of webstacks and optranet 
in performing these analyses  we used the best information available under the circumstances  including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future operating results 
the discount rates used in the analyses were for each of webstacks and optranet  which were based on historical risk premiums that investors required for companies of our size  industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to the sectors in which the two companies operated 
these amounts are based on our best estimate of future results 
as a result of our analysis  we recorded a charge to reduce goodwill and purchased intangible assets by million in the third quarter of fiscal amortization of deferred stock compensation  goodwill and purchased intangible assets amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal the amortization of deferred stock compensation relates primarily to options awarded to employees that were assumed in the optranet and webstacks acquisitions in fiscal  primarily in research and development 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal the increases in fiscal were due to the amortization related to the optranet and webstacks acquisitions in fiscal in fiscal  amortization of goodwill arising from warrants issued in april increased by million to million and amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to the optranet and webstacks acquisitions was million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review could result in a charge to earnings in the period any impairment is determined 
amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred stock compensation may continue to increase if we acquire companies and technologies 
we will no longer record amortization of goodwill in future periods because under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but rather is periodically evaluated for impairment 
see new accounting pronouncements 
restructuring and special charges during the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to lower our overall cost structure 
restructuring and special charges in fiscal included a charge related to the purchase of leased properties of million  a write off of excess facilities of million and a write off related to asset impairments of million  as described below 
we incurred a million charge in fiscal relating to two property leases we entered into in june  as described in note of notes to financial statements 
effective may   we exercised the option to purchase the leased properties for an aggregate of million  which represented the residual value guarantee under the lease arrangement of million  net of a million improvement allowance 
the appraised fair value of the land and buildings at the time of the option exercise was million 
accordingly  we recognized a charge of million 
upon completion of this transaction the purchased land and buildings were categorized as property and equipment on our balance sheet and the buildings are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives of years 
excess facilities charges for fiscal were million 
these costs are the result of our decision to permanently reduce the space occupied or to vacate certain domestic and international facilities 
the estimated 
table of contents facilities costs are based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets or estimated termination fees 
the actual loss could differ from this estimate if we are unsuccessful in negotiating affordable termination fees on certain facilities  if facility operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets  if it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  or if other estimates and assumptions change 
we anticipate that we will continue to make cash outlays to meet lease obligations for these facilities through unless estimates and assumptions change or we are able to negotiate to terminate the leases prior to the following is a summary of the excess facility charges in millions location reduced vacated amount santa clara  ca reduced february pleasanton  ca never occupied facility relates to optranet acquisition pleasanton  ca reduced march others various asset impairments were million for fiscal this charge represented the unamortized amount of the assets at the date a decision was made to discontinue use and these assets were not utilized subsequently and were not held for sale 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  restructuring and special charges included a write off of acquired in process research and development of million and a restructuring charge of million  as described below 
we recorded in process research and development charges of million related to the purchase of optranet in january and million related to the purchase of webstacks in march the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined through valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high technology industry and was immediately expensed in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified 
the charges are discussed in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march  we implemented a restructuring plan in order to lower our overall cost structure 
in connection with the restructuring  we reduced our headcount and consolidated facilities 
restructuring charges included in other operating expenses were million in the quarter ended march  and million in the quarter ended june  the restructuring expense included million for severance and benefits for approximately terminated employees  million for the write off and write down in carrying value of summit equipment and million in facility closure expenses 
as of june   all liabilities related to the restructuring plan have been paid 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower interest rates  offset by an increase in our available investment balances due to the net proceeds we received from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in december the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to the increased amount of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted investments and marketable securities from the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering in april and our secondary public offering in october interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of million in fiscal 
table of contents from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to interest expense on the convertible subordinated notes issued in december other expense other expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to write downs of investments in privately held companies that are being accounted for under the cost method 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to our share of losses from companies in which we had a minority interest which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting of million and write downs of investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting of million 
income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million for fiscal the benefit for fiscal results in an effective tax benefit rate of  which consists primarily of federal and state income tax benefits offset by nondeductible goodwill 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for fiscal  which consisted primarily of federal and state income tax benefits  offset by foreign taxes  nondeductible in process research and development and goodwill 
we recorded a tax provision of million for fiscal  which consisted primarily of federal taxes  state income taxes and foreign taxes  offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and total investments were million and million at june  and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in december and cash provided by operating activities of million  offset by capital expenditures of million and payments for acquisitions of million 
we generated million in cash from operations in fiscal despite a net loss of million 
the net loss included significant non cash charges  offset somewhat by the effect of deferred taxes 
the principal non cash charges were for impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets of million  restructuring and special charges of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
accounts receivable decreased from million at june  to million at june  days sales outstanding in receivables decreased to days at june  from days at june  the decrease in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding were primarily due to shipment linearity and improved collections performance 
inventory levels decreased from million at june  to million at june  inventory turns were times for fiscal and times for fiscal inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times and avoid stock outs with the risk of inventory excess or obsolescence because of recent declining demand  rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
as a result of the rapid change in the market for networking products  we recorded million and million in charges for excess and obsolete inventory and non cancelable purchase commitments in fiscal and  respectively 
deferred revenue increased from million at june  to million at june  this increase was due primarily to increased service obligations under maintenance contracts 
in june  we entered into two operating lease agreements for approximately acres of land and the accompanying  square feet of buildings to house our main campus in santa clara  california the property 
the two lease agreements provided us with the option to purchase the property at any time during the lease term 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we exercised our option to purchase the property for million using our investment securities previously held as collateral to fund the purchase 

table of contents we have a revolving line of credit for million with silicon valley bank 
as of june   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
the line of credit contains a provision for the issuance of letters of credit not to exceed the unused balance of the line 
at june   we had letters of credit totaling million 
the line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial covenants related to tangible net worth and liquidity with which we were in compliance as of june  the line of credit expires on november  it is our intention to renew this line of credit when it expires 
in december  we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes mature on december  interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are redeemable in cash at our option at an initial redemption price of of the principal amount on or after december if not converted to common stock prior to the redemption date 
each holder of the notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest upon a change of control of ownership of extreme  as defined in the offering circular 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations including interest expense at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years after three years contractual obligations convertible subordinated notes non cancelable operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures or non cancelable purchase commitments as of june  we require substantial capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
as a result  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital at any time 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
new accounting pronouncements goodwill and intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for a business combination as of the date a business combination is completed 
specifically  it requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after 
table of contents june   thereby eliminating use of the pooling of interests method 
sfas establishes guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after a business combination is completed 
among other things  it requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets will no longer be amortized and will instead be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired 
we adopted this statement beginning july  the effect of adopting sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of june   the unamortized balance of acquired intangible assets was approximately million  which is recorded in goodwill and purchased intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
this amount represents acquired technology and other identifiable intangibles  which will continue to be amortized upon adoption of sfas impairment of long lived assets in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas  the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the statement also supersedes certain provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period or periods in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date  as presently required 
we adopted this statement on july   and do not believe the effect of adopting this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
exit or disposal activities in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our operating results or financial position

prior to the adoption of eitf  reimbursable out of pocket expenses were reflected as a reduction to cost of revenue 
the impact upon revenue and cost of revenue in the six months ended june  was not material 
the announcement will have no impact on our gross margin or net income loss but will increase our net revenue and cost of revenue 
prior periods were not materially affected 

table of contents risk factors we have a limited history of profitability  we are not currently profitable and we cannot assure you that we will return to profitability in the future fiscal was the only year in which we have achieved profitability 
we reported a loss for fiscal and fiscal although we achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our revenues will decline for the first quarter of fiscal  and we expect to report a loss for the quarter 
we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales  marketing and service  product development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to rationalize expense levels and increase revenue levels to achieve profitability in future fiscal quarters 
a number of factors could cause our quarterly financial results to be worse than expected  resulting in a decline in our stock price our failure to control our operating expenses at a level that is consistent with anticipated revenues may cause our financial results to be worse than expected 
a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  so any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our stock to fall 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
orders at the beginning of each quarter do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time 
accordingly  we are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in the first quarter of fiscal we did not receive product orders during the quarter sufficient to meet our revenue expectations for the quarter  and we will report a loss for the quarter 
in addition  the timing of product releases and purchase orders  in addition to product availability  often results in a majority of our product shipments being scheduled near the end of a quarter 
failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
our customer agreements generally allow customers to delay scheduled delivery dates or to cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant charges to the customers 
furthermore  some of our customers require that we provide installation or inspection services that may delay the recognition of revenue for both products and services  and some of our customer agreements include acceptance provisions that prevent our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following changes in general and or specific economic conditions in the networking industry  seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services  particularly in asia and europe  our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products  which in the case of lower than expected sales  may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non cancelable purchase commitments for component parts  product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers  service providers and other potential large customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products on a timely basis  
table of contents increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  decreases in the prices of the products that we sell  our ability to achieve and maintain desired production volumes and quality levels for our products  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  costs relating to possible acquisitions and the integration of technologies or businesses  and the effect of amortization of deferred compensation and purchased intangibles resulting from existing or new transactions 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and returning to profitability the market for networking equipment is intensely competitive 
our principal competitors include cisco systems  enterasys networks  foundry networks  nortel networks and riverstone networks 
in addition  a number of private companies have announced plans for new products  or have introduced products  that may compete with our own products 
some of our current and potential competitors have superior market leverage  longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  in addition to wider name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
these competitors may have developed  or may in the future develop  new competing products based on technologies that compete with our own products or render our products obsolete 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic partnerships that enable them to offer or bring to market competitive products 
to remain competitive  we believe that we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products  improve our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
if we fail to do so  we may not compete successfully with our competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and future profitability 
if our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses and lose sales network products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are first released to the marketplace 
in the past  we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we recently experienced two component problems which caused us to incur unexpected costs and expenses and take an accrual for anticipated expenses and we have experienced such problems in prior periods 
our fiscal results for and for at least the first quarter of fiscal were adversely affected by such expenses 
we expect that such errors or component failures will be found from time to time in the future in new or existing products  including the components incorporated therein  after the commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts  delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems 
further  if product is not accepted by customers due to defects  and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defect returns based on our historical experience  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether or not caused by our products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue and our ability to grow our international sales depends on successfully expanding our international operations international sales constitute a significant portion of our sales 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the continued expansion of international sales 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors 
the failure of our resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  the payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations  difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  political and economic turbulence  potential adverse tax consequences  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including compliance with us and foreign export laws and regulations 
in addition  conducting our business on a global basis subjects us to a number of frequently changing and complex trade protection measures and import or export regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with these measures and regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of financial penalties and restrictions on our ability to conduct business in and with certain countries  which may harm our business and damage our reputation 
pursuant to regulations of the us department of commerce providing for voluntary disclosure  we have disclosed information regarding a possible violation of certain export regulations 
following such disclosures the department of commerce will determine whether to conduct an investigation 
if an investigation is commenced  we believe that these matters will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our business  and we are implementing procedures to reduce the risk of violations in the future 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency which will expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are not successful in managing these hedging transactions  we could incur losses from hedging activities 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease  which may reduce gross margin or revenue the network equipment industry has traditionally experienced a rapid erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing  technological progress and a slowdown in the economy that has resulted in excess inventory and lower prices as companies attempt to liquidate this inventory 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  excess inventories  increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors  including  for example  competitive products manufactured with low cost merchant silicon 
we may experience substantial decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
competitive pressures are expected to increase as a result of the industry slowdown that 
table of contents began in the first half of  coupled with the recent downturn in the broader economy 
to maintain our gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
some of our customers may not have the resources to pay for our products as a result of the current economic environment with the current economic slowdown  some of our customers are forecasting that their revenue for the foreseeable future will generally be lower than originally anticipated 
some of these customers are experiencing  or are likely to experience  serious cash flow problems and  as a result  find it increasingly difficult to obtain financing  if at all 
if some of these customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or securing alternate financing arrangements  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment for  the amounts that they owe us 
furthermore  they may not order as many products from us as originally forecast  or cancel orders with us entirely 
the inability of some of our potential customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our cash flow  the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue  which may cause our stock price to decline 
the market in which we compete is subject to rapid technological progress and to compete we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment  our product lines will become obsolete 
developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for our products 
alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture 
we cannot assure you that our technological approach will achieve broad market acceptance or that other technologies or devices will not supplant our own products and technology 
when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
the market for switching products is evolving and we believe our ability to compete successfully in this market is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
in particular  the networking industry has been characterized by the successive introduction of new technologies or standards that have dramatically reduced the price and increased the performance of switching equipment 
to remain competitive  we need to introduce products in a timely manner that incorporate  or are compatible with  these emerging technologies 
we cannot assure you that any new products we introduce will be commercially successful 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the past that resulted in lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
we may experience similar delays in product development and releases in the future  and any delay in product introduction could adversely affect our ability to compete  causing our operating results to be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against claims may adversely affect our ability to compete we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  
table of contents documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we are actively involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  or if we otherwise settle such claims  we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights 
any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may become engaged in litigation regarding intellectual property rights  and an adverse outcome could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs we have received notice from several major companies alleging that we are infringing their patents 
without regard to the merits of any of these claims  if judgments by a court of law on any claim received in the future were to be upheld  or if we otherwise agree to the settlement of such claims  the consequences to us may be severe and could require us to  among other actions stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use the disputed technology 
if we are compelled to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
adjustments to the size of our operations may require us to incur unanticipated costs prior to the quarter ended march   we experienced rapid growth and expansion that placed  and may in the future place  a significant strain on our resources 
subsequent to the quarter ended march   we have incurred unanticipated costs to downsize our operations to a level consistent with downward forecasts in sales 
even if we manage the current period of instability effectively  as well as possible expansion in the future  we may make mistakes in restructuring or operating our business such as inaccurate sales forecasting or incorrect material planning 
any of these mistakes may lead to unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to size our operations in accordance with growth or decline of our business in the future 
delays in the implementation of new management information systems may cause a significant burden on our operations we are implementing additional management information systems and developing further operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls to maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  accounting  finance  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
in addition  we recently completed the transition to a new enterprise resource planning system 
we may be unable to operate adequate control systems in an efficient manner  and our current or planned personnel systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
the difficulties associated with designing and implementing these new systems  procedures and controls may place a significant burden on our management and our internal resources 
in addition  as we grow internationally  we will need to expand our worldwide 
table of contents operations and enhance our communications infrastructure 
any delay in the implementation of such new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  or any disruption in the transition to such new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain  and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
we must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenue and improve our operating results our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels through resellers and distributors 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
many of our resellers also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional reseller and or distribution agreements or that we will be able to successfully manage our product sales channels 
our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
in addition  our operating results will likely fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and amount of orders from our resellers 
we cannot assure you that our resellers and or distributors will continue to market or sell our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
most of our revenue is derived from sales of three product families  so we are dependent on widespread market acceptance of these products during fiscal  we derived substantially all of our revenue from sales of our summit  blackdiamond and alpine products and related service 
we expect that revenue from these product families will account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  widespread market acceptance of our product families is vital to our future success 
factors that may affect the sales of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include the demand for switching products gigabit ethernet and layer switching technologies in particular in the enterprise and service provider markets  the performance  price and total cost of ownership of our products  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  our ability to match supply with demand for certain products  and the success and development of our resellers  distributors and field sales channels 
we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our product families  which could reduce our revenue and cause our stock price to fall 
future performance will depend on the introduction and acceptance of new products our future performance will also depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address customer requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
in the past  we have experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future 
we are currently engaged in development of a third generation chipset planned for use in future products 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
therefore  to the extent customers defer or cancel orders in the expectation of new product releases  any delay in the development or introduction of new products could cause our operating results to suffer 
the inability to achieve and maintain widespread levels of market acceptance for our current and future products may significantly impair our revenue growth 
if a key reseller  distributor or other significant customer cancels or delays a large purchase  our net revenue may decline and the price of our stock may fall to date  a limited number of resellers  distributors and other customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
if any of our large customers stop or delay purchases  our revenue and profitability would be 
table of contents adversely affected 
for example  in fiscal and  one customer  who is a distributor of our products  accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenue 
our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term  so a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller  distributor or other customer could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
although our largest customers may differ from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of customers  particularly in view of the relatively high per unit sales price of our products and long sales cycles 
while our financial performance depends on large orders from a limited number of key resellers  distributors and other significant customers  we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them 
for example our service provider and enterprise customers can stop purchasing  and our resellers and distributors can stop marketing  our products at any time  our reseller agreements are non exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation upon the resellers to renew the agreements  and our reseller  distributor and end user customer agreements generally do not require minimum purchases 
under specified conditions  some third party distributors are allowed to return products to us 
we do not recognize revenue on sales to distributors until the distributors sell the product to their customers 
the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated the use of indirect sales channels may contribute to the length and variability of our sales cycle 
our products have a relatively high per unit sales price  and the purchase of our products often constitutes a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
accordingly  the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and as a result  our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks  including the risk that budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales  the risk of substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer  making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess  the risk that we may incur substantial sales  marketing and service expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers  but not succeed  and the risk that  if a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results 
we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  static random access memory  or sram  and printed circuit boards have been  and may be in the future  in short supply 
we have in the past  and are likely in the future  to encounter shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components  and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole source components include asics  microprocessors  
table of contents programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memories  dynamic and static random access memories  or drams and srams  respectively  and printed circuit boards 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if forecasts exceed orders  we may have excess and or obsolete inventory on hand or under non cancelable purchase commitments that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if orders exceed forecasts  we may have inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we do not have agreements fixing long term prices or minimum volume requirements from these suppliers 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time consuming and costly  and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production 
in addition  during the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
we cannot assure you that similar delays will not occur in the future 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the performance of the components as incorporated in our products will meet the quality requirements of our customers 
our dependence on contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity  and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation  and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we rely on independent contractors to manufacture our products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of these manufacturers 
we currently utilize three companies for the manufacture of our products flextronics international  ltd  located in san jose  california  solectron corporation  located in milpitas  california and plexus corp  located in nampa  idaho and penang  malaysia 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from contract manufacturers in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
similar or other problems may arise in the future  such as inferior quality  insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we do not know whether we will effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to transition the manufacture of some of our products from one contract manufacturer to another 
we also intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or a reduction in the number of contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturers by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower cost geographies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
legislative actions  higher insurance costs and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there have been regulatory changes  including the sarbanes oxley act of  and there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings  which will have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and other rule changes and proposed legislative initiatives are likely to increase general and administrative costs 
in addition  insurers are likely to increase rates as a result of high claims rates over the past year and our rates for our various insurance policies are likely to increase 
further  proposed initiatives could result in changes in accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as an expense 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles  and adversely affect our operating results 
we have been named as a defendant in a shareholder class action lawsuit arising out of our public offerings of securities in if we do not prevail in this lawsuit  our business may suffer beginning on july   purported securities fraud class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the cases were consolidated and the litigation is now captioned as in re extreme networks  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
no 
sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas sdny on or about april   plaintiffs electronically served an amended complaint 
the amended complaint is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased extreme s common stock from april  through december  it names as defendants extreme  six of its present and former officers  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of extreme s initial public offering and october secondary offering 
the complaint alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the registration statement for the offerings did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the offerings in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the securities act of allegations against extreme and its officers are made as to the secondary offering only 
the amended complaint also alleges that false analyst reports were issued 
no specific damages are claimed 
we are aware that similar allegations have been made in other lawsuits filed in the southern district of new york challenging over other initial public offerings and secondary offerings conducted in and on july   we and the other issuer defendants filed a motion to dismiss 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the lawsuit 
failure to prevail could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
in addition  we may become subject to other types of litigation in the future 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we and manufacturers of our products rely on a continuous supply of power to conduct operations  and an energy crisis could disrupt our business and increase our expenses california experienced an energy crisis in the recurrence of an energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for california fall below  electricity providers have on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts 
two of the manufacturers of our products  flextronics and solectron  are located in 
table of contents california 
in the event of an energy crisis  these contractors may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs  or they may increase the fees charged for their services 
we do not have long term contracts with either flextronics or solectron 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of products would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill our orders  which could harm our business  and any increase in their fees could adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  the majority of our operations are located in california 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would temporarily be unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at these facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operation 
our headquarters are located in northern california where disasters may occur that could disrupt our operations and harm our business our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our and our manufacturers property 
in addition  terrorist acts or acts of war targeted at the united states  and specifically silicon valley  could cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors and resellers  and customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we currently do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster or catastrophic event 
in the event of such an occurrence  our business would suffer 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our goals our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales  marketing and service and operations personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with these individuals nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and service  finance and operations personnel 
the market for these personnel is competitive  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty hiring employees  particularly engineers  in the timeframe we desire 
in addition  retention has become more difficult for us and other public technology companies as a result of the recent stock market decline  which caused the price of many of our employees options to be above the current market price of our stock 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring desired personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as new product introductions 
in addition  companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time received claims like this from other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we do not know whether we will receive additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel or that such claims will not result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against any such claims  regardless of the merits of such claims 

table of contents our products must comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations or else our products may not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from growing our net revenue or achieving profitability the market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards  and in the future we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
our products must comply with various united states federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  in addition to standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability 
failure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results the sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we may not be able to increase net revenue unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families 
a failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
from time to time we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in  and to acquire  businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or expend significant cash 
these actions by us could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock 
moreover  even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings  there may be a lag between the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits 
this is particularly relevant in cases where it is necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre existing relationships 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  
table of contents the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation or similar items  and impairment charges taken in the future for goodwill amounts that cannot be supported in future periods 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations and  if it is not available when needed  we may need to reduce our planned development and marketing efforts  which may reduce our net revenue and prevent us from achieving profitability we believe that our existing working capital  based on proceeds from our initial public offering in april  proceeds from our secondary offering in october  proceeds from our convertible subordinated debt offering in december and cash available from credit facilities and future operations  will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of reseller and distribution channels and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
in addition  if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated  or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenue  we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital 
as a result  we could be required to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities may provide the holders certain rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of common stockholders  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we significantly increased our leverage as a result of the sale of convertible subordinated notes in connection with the sale of convertible subordinated notes in december  we incurred million of indebtedness 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of interest on the convertible notes  payment of the principal amount of the convertible notes  future capital expenditures  payments on our leases and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
the degree to which we are financially leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity  we could attempt to refinance the notes  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  
table of contents if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default under the indenture and could cause a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness 
we have entered into long term lease agreements for several facilities that are currently vacant and may be difficult to sublease due to current real estate market conditions we have certain long term real estate lease commitments carrying future obligations for non cancelable lease payments net of estimated sublease income 
reductions in our workforce and the restructuring of operations during fiscal year resulted in the need to consolidate certain of these leased facilities  located primarily in northern california 
we recorded excess facilities charges of million during fiscal see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
we intend to sublease certain of these facilities and may obtain sublease income to offset the carrying costs of these facilities 
however  based on a recent deterioration of real estate market conditions in connection with a downturn in the economy  we may not be able to sublease these facilities at the times or on the terms we anticipated when we took the excess facilities charge and therefore if the market does not improve  we may incur additional charges in the future 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements  and these costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price and the price of the notes may significantly fluctuate in the future in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our customers results fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change  or when investors change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights prior to those of our common stock  including the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to you or us 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our common stock and  therefore  the notes our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate 
table of contents with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  under the plan  each right will entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for 
each such fractional share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
generally  the rights may become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own or more of our common stock 
when the rights become exercisable  our board of directors has the right to authorize the issuance of one share of our common stock in exchange for each right that is then exercisable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of june  and june  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fairvalue in thousands june  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate 
table of contents exchange rate sensitivity currently  all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the year ended june  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  british pounds  swedish krona and euros 
these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
at june   these exposures amounted to million and were partially offset by forward foreign currency contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses  denominated in japanese yen  the euro  swedish krona and british pound 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas at june   these exposures amounted to million and were partially offset by forward foreign currency contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
typically  changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by changes upon remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these contracts have original maturities ranging from one to three months 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency transaction losses from operations  including the impact of hedging  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
investments in equity securities we have historically made investments in several privately held companies 
these nonmarketable investments are accounted for under the cost method  as ownership is less than percent and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  financing and investing activities of the investee companies 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is possible that we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
as a part of management s process of regularly reviewing these investments for impairment  we recorded write downs of million on certain investments  which were determined to be other than temporarily impaired in fiscal at june   the carrying value of our remaining investments was immaterial
