item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  produce and market sophisticated wireless telecommunications transmission products and systems and solid state high power broadband amplifiers for commercial and government purposes 
our products are used in point to point and point to multipoint telecommunication applications such as satellite communications  over the horizon microwave systems  telephone systems and cable and broadcast television 
our broadband amplifier products are also used in cellular and pcs instrumentation testing  medical instrumentation and certain defense systems 
our business consists of three segments telecommunications transmission  rf microwave amplifiers and mobile data communications services 
our sales are made to domestic and international customers  both commercial and governmental 
international sales including sales to prime contractors for end use by international customers are expected to remain a substantial portion of our total sales for the foreseeable future due to the worldwide demand for wireless and satellite telecommunication products and services 
at times  a substantial portion of our sales may be derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of which cannot be predicted 
quarterly sales and operating results may be significantly affected by one or more of such contracts 
accordingly  we can experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
sales consist of stand alone products and systems 
for the past several years  we have endeavored to achieve greater product sales as a percentage of total sales  because product sales generally have higher gross profit margins than systems sales 
in the future  as our installed base of mobile data communications terminals is established  an increasing amount of our sales may be attributable to the recurring service revenue component of our mobile data communications services segment 
we generally recognize income on contracts only when the products are shipped 
however  when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period  income is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
profits expected to be realized on contracts are based on total estimated sales value as related to estimated costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts in progress are recorded in the period in which such losses become known 
since our contract with the us army for the movement tracking system is for an eight year period  revenue recognition is based on the percentage of completion method 
the gross margin is based on the estimated sales and expenses for the entire eight year contract 
the amount of revenue recognized has been limited to the amount of funded orders received from the us army 
the portion of such orders representing service time revenue is being deferred until the service time is used by the customer 
significant changes in the estimates used to derive the gross profit margin can materially impact our operating results and financial condition in future periods see critical accounting policies below for more information 
our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services sold  production efficiency  price competition and general economic conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for marketing  sales and administrative employees  advertising and trade show costs  professional fees and amortization of deferred compensation 
our research and development expenses relate to both existing product enhancement and new product development 
a portion of our research and development efforts is related to specific contracts and is recoverable under those contracts because they are funded by the customers 
such customer funded expenditures are not included in research and development expenses for financial reporting purposes  but are reflected in cost of sales 
comtech wireless  inc designed and manufactured wireless local loop systems for the rural and remote telephony market 
due to disappointing results and uncertain prospects  effective july   we adopted a plan to liquidate comtech wireless  inc on or about january  the results of operations for the segment have been shown as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
in january  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of hill engineering inc hill in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price amounted to approximately million  which principally represents the fair value of the initial  shares of common stock to be issued to hill 
the remaining  shares were placed in escrow and will only be released to the sellers if certain profit goals  as defined in the agreement are met and will be recorded at fair value on the date when the profit goals are met 
this business is part of the rf microwave amplifiers segment 
the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired of approximately million  net of amortization  is included in goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in july  we acquired the business of ef data  the satellite communications division of adaptive broadband corporation for cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development and expensed as of the acquisition date 
forty million dollars of the purchase price was supplied through institutional secured borrowings bearing interest at due in installments through  and the balance from internal company funds 
in april  we acquired certain assets and product lines of mpd technologies  inc for cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million 
the purchase price was financed through million of institutional secured borrowings and the balance from internal company funds 
the secured borrowing bears interest at a rate of and requires interest only payments through june at which time the entire principal is due 
we combined this operation with our comtech pst corp 
operation in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
on july   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of advanced hardware architectures  inc for cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development and expensed as of the acquisition date 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition on long term contracts as discussed above  when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period  revenue and related costs are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses become known 
some of the company s largest contracts  including its contract with the us army for the movement tracking system  are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
if the company does not accurately estimate the total sales and related costs on such contracts  the estimated gross margins may be significantly impacted or losses may need to be recognized in future periods 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
the cumulative orders to date under the movement tracking system contract have been far below the army s initial requirements 
the company is currently in active discussions with the army to address the funding shortfalls experienced to date on this program 
the ultimate resolution of these discussions could result in  among other things  material changes to the estimates used in applying the percentage of completion method of accounting 
impairment of intangible assets as of july   the company s intangible assets  including goodwill  aggregated million 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to the company s results of operations 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends 
the review of excess and obsolete inventory primarily relates to our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifier segments 
several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories  including our decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in a change in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in the company s financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charges could be material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
generally  we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly 
in addition  we have obtained credit insurance for certain international customers that we have determined could be a credit risk 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of our net sales year ended july  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses amortization of intangibles operating income loss from continuing operations interest expense income  net income loss before income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to the weak economic environment  particularly in our telecommunications transmission segment 
sales from our telecommunications transmission segment were million in fiscal  as compared to sales of million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
we believe sales in this segment will continue to be adversely impacted until conditions in the telecommunications industry improve 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  sales from our rf microwave amplifier segment were million as compared to million in fiscal this increase of million or was principally the result of the acquisition in april of certain assets and product lines of mpd technologies  inc our rf microwave amplifier segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal sales from our mobile data communications segment were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
this increase was due to increased sales of our movement tracking system to the us army 
sales from this segment represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  our sales to the us army for the movement tracking system represented of our total net sales 
there were no customers in fiscal which constituted or more of our total net sales 
international sales represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal domestic commercial sales represented of total net sales as compared to in fiscal and sales to the us government and its agencies represented and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to the reduced total level of sales discussed above 
gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin percentage was driven by the significant decrease in telecommunications transmission segment sales which generally carry higher margins than sales from the other two segments 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million 
the decrease is related to the reduction in sales during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
despite the softness in sales discussed above  we are continuing to invest in the future by enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which amounts are not reflected in the reported research and development expenses 
in process research and development 
in connection with the purchase of certain assets and liabilities of advanced hardware architectures  inc  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development 
this allocation was part of the overall purchase price allocation performed by an independent third party 
the value of in process research and development is based upon new product development projects that were underway at the time of the acquisition and are expected to eventually lead to new products but had not yet established technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we recorded a one time charge of million for the write off of this amount 
there was no in process research and development expense in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
separate intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal if sfas no 
had been effective august   approximately million of amortization expense would not have been expensed in fiscal operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we had operating income from continuing operations of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the in process research and development charge in fiscal  operating income was million 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additional interest on borrowings in connection with the acquisition of mpd technologies  inc in april were more than offset by interest savings from the prepayment of million of debt in august interest income 
interest income was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was the result of a lower level of investable funds during fiscal  as well as lower interest rates 
other  net 
our other income for fiscal was  as compared to other expense of million for fiscal the amount in fiscal primarily related to the loss realized upon the sale in march of a short term investment classified as available for sale  offset by royalty and other income received of million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
during fiscal  the company conducted an independent study and identified certain research and experimentation tax credits  relating to the current and prior years  which can be used to offset regular income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the total amount of these credits more than offset the provision for income taxes 
the net effect was a benefit of million for fiscal comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the acquisition in july of ef data 
this business  which is included in our telecommunications transmission segment  increased our product offerings and broadened our customer base for satellite earth station equipment 
sales from our telecommunications transmission segment were million or of our total net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of our total net sales in fiscal substantially all of the increase in the telecommunications transmission segment was the result of the ef data acquisition 
in fiscal  sales from our rf microwave amplifier segment were million as compared to million in fiscal approximately million of this million increase was due to the acquisition we completed in april of certain assets and product lines of mpd technologies  inc this acquisition has increased our product offerings and our customer base in our rf microwave amplifier segment 
the rf microwave amplifier segment was of our total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal sales from our mobile data communications services segment were million or of our total net sales in fiscal compared to million or in fiscal this increase of approximately million was primarily due to increased sales of our movement tracking system to the us army 
international sales represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of international sales reflects the absence in fiscal of significant revenues from one customer for over the horizon microwave equipment which occurred in fiscal domestic sales represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal us government sales represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal there were no customers in fiscal that represented or more of our total sales 
in fiscal  sales to one customer  a major us prime contractor for ultimate sale to an international end user  represented of total sales 
sales during the second half of fiscal were adversely impacted by the weakening economy 
particular softness was experienced in our telecommunications transmission segment as a result of the significant downturn in the telecommunications market 
we believe sales will continue to be adversely impacted until such economic conditions improve 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the higher gross margin in fiscal was largely due to the increase in the sale of satellite earth station equipment products by our telecommunications transmission segment as a result of the ef data acquisition 
those products generally have a lower per unit cost and yield a higher gross margin than most other products and systems we sell 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
this increase was the result of additional expenses  including additional personnel  sales and marketing expenses and other administrative expenses  required to support the higher sales volume 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were and of total net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in fiscal was principally due to the continuation of research and development for the projects that were underway at the time of our acquisition of ef data in july  as well as for expenses related to new product development and product announcements for all of our businesses 
as an investment for the future we are continually enhancing and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which amounts are not reflected in the reported research and development expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the full year of amortization expense relating to goodwill and other identified intangibles associated with our acquisition of ef data in july the increase also reflects the amortization of intangibles resulting from our april acquisition of mpd technologies 
in process research and development 
there was no in process research and development expense in fiscal in fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of ef data  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development 
our financial statements for fiscal include a one time charge of million for the write off of this amount in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
operating income loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we had operating income from continuing operations of million in fiscal as compared to an operating loss from continuing operations in fiscal of million 
excluding the impact of the in process research and development charge in fiscal  operating income was million 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and  for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately million 
the increase was primarily due to the interest on the long term debt we incurred in connection with the acquisition of ef data in july the original amount of the loan was million payable over five years 
in connection with our acquisition of certain assets and product lines from mpd technologies  inc in april  we borrowed an additional million 
interest income 
interest income was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of  this increase in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in the amount of cash available in excess of working capital requirements  principally as result of the proceeds received from a follow on stock offering completed in the third quarter of fiscal other expense  net 
other expense  net was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the amount in fiscal related to a loss of  realized upon the sale in march of a short term investment classified as available for sale  offset by royalty and other income of  the amount in fiscal primarily related to the loss realized upon the sale of a short term investment classified as available for sale 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal reflects an effective tax rate of 
the fiscal provision for income taxes was effected by a change in the valuation allowance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the provision for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents position decreased to million at july  from million at july  during fiscal  we prepaid million of long term debt and paid approximately million  including expenses  for the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of advanced hardware architectures  inc net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal such amount reflects i net income of million  plus the impact of non cash items such as depreciation and amortization aggregating million  and the write off of in process research and development of million  and ii the changes in working capital balances 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million 
cash of million was used for capital expenditures and million was used for the acquisition of advanced hardware architectures  inc net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million 
we prepaid million of long term debt 
principal payments on capital lease obligations amounted to million 
these uses of cash were offset by proceeds from the sale of stock and exercise of stock options aggregating approximately million 
in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
we do not expect that these commitments as of july  will materially adversely affect our liquidity 
at july  we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt including capital lease obligations and to make payments under operating leases 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows obligations due by fiscal year in thousands and and after total long term debt   capital lease obligations    operating lease commitments      total contractual cash obligations      we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements with financial institutions relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
at july   the balance of these agreements was million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we identify a significant acquisition that requires additional cash  we would seek to borrow additional funds or raise additional equity capital

forward looking statements and risk factors many statements in this form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements include o statements of goals  intentions and expectations  o estimates of risks and of future costs and benefits  and o statements of the ability to achieve financial and other goals 
these forward looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by o management s estimates and projections of us and international economic and business conditions  o future laws and regulations  and o a variety of other matters  including those described below 
because of these uncertainties  actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements  which are inherently predictive and speculative 
the following are some of the risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such statements 
all of our businesses are subject to rapid technological change  we must keep pace with changes to compete successfully 
we are engaged in businesses characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product announcements and enhancements  and changing customer demands 
the introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive 
the technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly  and our business position depends  in large part  on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development  either through internal research and development or acquisitions  of new or enhanced products and technologies 
we may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost effective fashion 
a significant technological breakthrough by others  including smaller competitors or new firms  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
a slowing economy and continued reduction in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
during the second half of fiscal and all of fiscal  our revenues were negatively affected by the increasingly uncertain economic environment both in the overall market  and more specifically in the telecommunications sector 
if the economy continues to slow  some of our customers may further reduce their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems 
as a consequence  our current customers and other prospective customers may postpone  reduce or even forego the purchase of our products and systems  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our mobile data communications services business is subject to risk 
our mobile data communications services business has a limited operating history 
it is subject to all of the risks inherent in the operation of a new business enterprise 
moreover  our business experience has been in producing products  not in providing services 
we may not be able to implement and operate our mobile data communications services business successfully 
in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  the risk factors applicable to our mobile data communications services business include the following o although the us army contract obligates us to provide up to  mobile terminals and worldwide satellite services over an eight year period as and when ordered by the us army and at the fixed prices and other terms set forth in this contract  the us army is not obligated to purchase any terminals or services under this contract and may terminate this contract 
sales under the us army contract will be subject to unpredictable funding and deployment decisions 
through july   we have received orders for million under this contract 
o certain components that we need have purchasing lead time of four months or longer  and the us army contract requires us to provide mobile terminals within days after we receive an order 
o our success in commercial markets will depend on  among other things  our ability to access the best distribution channels  the development of applications which create value for the customer and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
delays in delivering terminals could also adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain commercial customers 
o in general  as we seek to grow our mobile data communications services business  we anticipate that we will need to maintain a substantial inventory in order to provide terminals to our customers on a timely basis 
if forecasted orders are not received  we might be left with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts or terminals 
this could result in an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
o we lease the satellite capacity necessary to operate our system from third party satellite networks 
we currently have a long term lease with a satellite network operator tmi for satellite coverage in north america  central america and the northern rim of south america 
while several vendors have announced plans for new satellite systems  only one provider  inmarsat  presently offers the global coverage that will be required under the us army contract 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient satellite capacity or geographical coverage from any vendor to operate our mobile data communications services system on acceptable terms or on a timely basis 
o there are several existing competitors in the mobile data communications market that have established systems with sizable customer bases and much greater financial resources than us 
the largest of these competitors is qualcomm incorporated 
existing competitors  including terrestrial service providers  are also aggressively pricing their products and services and may continue to do so in the future 
competitors continue to offer new value added products and services  which we may be unable to match on a timely or cost effective basis 
increased competition may impact margins throughout the industry 
we anticipate that new competitors will enter the mobile data communications market in the future 
o all satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service 
interruptions in service could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
with respect to us satellite service  satellite network providers have arranged to provide back up satellite and ground station service for each other in the event of catastrophic failure 
o we believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our mobile data communications services business as currently contemplated 
if our terminals or services are found to infringe on protected technology  we could be required to redesign our terminals  license the protected technology  and or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party 
if we are unable to license protected technology used in our terminals or if we were required to redesign our terminals  we could be prohibited from making and selling our terminals or providing mobile data communications services 
due to many factors  including the amount of business represented by large contracts  our operating results are difficult to forecast and may be volatile 
we have experienced  and will experience in the future  significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
one reason for this is that a significant portion of our business primarily the over the horizon microwave systems and other products of our telecommunications transmission business segment and a portion of our rf microwave amplifier business segment is derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of which cannot be predicted 
while we generally recognize income on contracts when the products are shipped  income is recognized on the percentage of completion method when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period 
our net sales and operating results also may vary significantly from period to period because of the following factors product mix sold  fluctuating market demand  price competition  new product introductions by our competitors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in delivery of components or subsystems  political instability  regulatory developments  and general economic conditions 
accordingly  you should not rely on period to period comparisons as indications of our future performance because these comparisons may not be meaningful 
our dependence on international sales may adversely affect us 
sales for use by international customers including sales to prime contractors international customers represented approximately  and  of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
approximately of our backlog at july  consisted of orders for use by foreign customers 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our total sales 
these sales expose us to certain risks  including barriers to trade  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may make our products less price competitive  political and economic instability  availability of suitable export financing  tariff regulations  and other us and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products and the generally greater difficulties of doing business abroad 
we attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers  contracts denominated in us dollars  advance payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor 
foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government 
in addition  certain of our products and systems may require licenses from us government agencies for export from the united states  and some of our products are not permitted to be exported 
we cannot be sure of our ability to gain any licenses that may be required to export our products  and failure to receive required licenses could materially reduce our ability to sell our products outside the united states 
our dependence on component availability  subcontractor availability and performance and key suppliers may adversely affect us 
we do not generally maintain a substantial inventory of components and subsystems 
we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources  but believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors 
a significant interruption in the delivery of such items  however  could have a material effect on our business and results of operations 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification 
we currently have a backlog of orders  mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate 
we cannot assure you that our backlog will result in net sales 
our sales to the us government are subject to funding and other risks 
we sell our products and services to agencies of the us government or to contractors or subcontractors under contracts with us agencies 
these sales accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
as is customary for government sales  these sales are subject to various risks 
these risks include the ability of the us government to o change government policy which could reduce our business  o terminate existing contracts for its convenience  and o audit our contract related costs and fees  including allocated indirect costs 
a reduction in government agency budgets could cause us to experience declining net sales  increased pressure on operating margins and  in certain cases  net losses 
the loss or significant cutback of a large program in which we participate  such as the mobile data communications services us army contract  could also materially adversely affect our future results of operations 
all of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience 
termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed  settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination 
in addition to the right of the us government to terminate  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by congress of the necessary spending 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 
consequently  at the beginning of a major program  the contract is usually not fully funded  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if  as and when appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
the us government may review our costs and performance on their contracts  as well as our accounting and general business practices 
based on the results of such audits  the us government may adjust our contract related costs and fees  including certain financing costs  goodwill  portions of research and development costs  and certain marketing expenses  which may not be reimbursable under us government contracts 
we obtain us government contracts through a competitive bidding process 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that awarded contracts will generate sufficient net sales to result in profitability 
acquisitions and strategic investments may divert our resources and management attention  results may fall short of expectations 
we intend to continue pursuing selected acquisitions of and investments in businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including o difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  o diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and o potential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business 
our fixed price contracts subject us to risk 
almost all of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts 
this means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological  manufacturing  supply or other problems  price increases or increases in the cost of performance 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more commercially effective than our own 
we expect the department of defense s increased use of commercial off the shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market 
also  although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries  we believe competition may intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services 
many of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution resources greater than ours 
the loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel  including the key management at each of our subsidiaries 
many of our key personnel  particularly the key engineers of our subsidiaries  would be difficult to replace  and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements 
our growth and future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations is intense 
although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and keeping key personnel  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably 
also  the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow and diversify 
our success also depends to a significant extent upon our president and chief executive officer  fred kornberg 
the loss of the services of mr 
kornberg could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have entered into an employment contract with mr 
kornberg 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the risk of third party claims of infringement 
our businesses rely in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically  patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights 
however  patents are important to protecting our intellectual property rights in comtech aha s tpc chips and comtech systems mbs adaptive modem 
we rely upon the laws of unfair competition  restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
these efforts allow us to rely upon the knowledge and experience of our management and technical personnel to market our existing products and to develop new products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  the breach of their confidentiality and non disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
our operations are subject to environmental regulation 
we are subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products  particularly in the fabrication of fiberglass antennas by our comtech antenna systems  inc subsidiary 
we believe that we are currently in compliance  in all material respects  with such regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public companies 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well 
factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include o future announcements concerning us or our competitors  o receipt or non receipt of substantial orders for products and services  o results of technological innovations  o new commercial products  o changes in recommendations of securities analysts  o government regulations  o proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  o changes in market conditions generally  particularly in the market for small cap stocks  and o limited public float 
shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends 
we have never declared or paid a cash dividend and do not intend to declare any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds and short term us treasury securities
