the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a designer  developer and manufacturer of direct attached and san storage area network ready data storage enclosures and storage management software for computing operations 
our product line supports a variety of operating systems  including windows nt and windows  solaris  linux  sgi irix and macintosh platforms 
designed for storage intensive environments such as the internet or other mission critical applications  our products are offered in fibre channel  fibre to scsi and scsi architectures 
our activities in the information storage industry have evolved through several acquisitions  the first of which occurred in june when we acquired certain assets associated with the computer storage business in lake mary  florida from seagate peripherals  inc in december  we acquired substantially all the net assets of parity systems  inc in june and july  we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of andataco  inc  located in san diego  california  and in november  we acquired the remaining of andataco 
in early  we completed the transfer of our lake mary manufacturing operations to our san diego facility and moved our corporate headquarters to san diego 
as a result of the acquisition of andataco  we believe that comparisons between and may not be meaningful because andataco s operating results were not included in our consolidated financial statements until june in january  we acquired substantially all the assets of oneofus company limited  a taiwan based  privately held designer of high performance fibre channel raid controllers and storage solutions for open systems and the san market 
in addition  in january  we sold substantially all of the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary borg adaptive technologies  inc which we had acquired in april  principally consisting of certain patented technology referred to as adaptive raid  to a subsidiary of qlogic corporation 
going concern with respect to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  we have received a going concern opinion from our auditors 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our recurring operating losses  our continued experience of negative cash flows from operating activities  the fact that we are not in compliance with certain covenants and provisions of our existing bank facility and have been advised that the bank does not intend to renew that facility  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
a going concern opinion indicates that although there is substantial doubt  the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill loss from operations gain on sale of borg assets interest expense and other items  net loss before extraordinary items extraordinary gains losses net loss comparison of years ended december  and for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  results of operations for include net extraordinary gains of 
million  consisting of million of gains from negotiated discounts on purchases from vendors  less a 
million extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment 
results for also include losses on marketable securities principally unrealized of 
million 
results of operations for include a net gain of million from the sale of borg assets and a charge of million for the impairment of unamortized goodwill 
sales sales for were million as compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
the significant decrease reflects the transition from our older technology legacy products to our technology products centered around our nexstor u storage enclosures and raid systems as well as the economic downturn which has caused customer delays in acquiring technology and other capital equipment 
during  we began to expand our indirect channel business and shift our sales and marketing strategy to provide greater technical marketing and sales support to our indirect sales function 
as part of that strategy  since january  we have significantly reduced our direct sales personnel and related costs  and are currently focusing our direct sales force to targeted markets as well as existing customers 
during  direct  indirect and service revenues represented  and of our sales revenues  compared to  and in in august  we sold substantially all of our service business  accordingly  we expect our service revenues for to be insignificant 
the higher service revenues in relates to the recognition as revenue of the remaining unamortized deferred revenues following the sale of the service business 
cost of sales gross margins gross margins decreased from in to in gross margins in both periods were adversely affected by the level of fixed costs inherent in our operations as compared with significantly lower than expected sales levels as well as increases in inventory reserves due to obsolete inventory of million and million in and  respectively 
our gross margins are dependent  in part  on product mix  which fluctuates from time to time 
our material costs are subject to fluctuations experienced during business cycles that create shortages and excess supplies of some critical components  thereby creating increases and decreases in prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased to million in from million in the million decrease is primarily the result of our overall work force reduction discussed under sales 
we expect these costs to continue to decrease during as a direct result of recent further reductions in our overall workforce 
research and development research and development expenses amounted to million in  as compared to million in amounts in both years reflect the costs incurred to develop our nexstor and u product lines 
we believe that considerable future investments in research and development will be required to remain competitive 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are incurred substantially in advance of related revenues  or in certain situations  may not result in generating revenues 
depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill depreciation and amortization decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to reduced amortization resulting from the fourth quarter write down of million of goodwill which was determined to have been impaired because of our projected inability to generate sufficient future operating income from the assets acquired in the andataco acquisition 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  which revises the accounting for purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized and will be tested for impairment annually 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
the company expects its implementation of sfas in will result in the discontinuation of amortization of unamortized goodwill with a carrying amount of approximately million as of december  amortization for the year ended december  amounted to 
million 
other income  net other income  net amounted to 
million in  primarily consisting of the reversal of previously recorded liabilities which were determined in to no longer be due  partially offset by a write off of certain assets related to our taiwan facility 
in  other income was not significant 
interest expense interest expense decreased 
million to 
million in the decrease is primarily attributable to decreased lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  which  more likely than not  will not be realized based on recent operating results 
net loss available to common stock preferred stock dividends during and  with the exception of our series k preferred stock  all classes of our convertible preferred stock required dividends at per annum 
preferred stock dividends increased by 
million to million during principally due to the issuance of million and million of preferred stock in december and april  respectively  partially offset by the automatic conversion of million and million of preferred stock to common stock in july and october  respectively 
in connection with the halco investment  which closed in november  all of our remaining convertible preferred stock and accrued dividends thereon were converted to common stock 
induced conversion of convertible preferred stock in november  as a result of inducement shares issued in connection with the conversion of our convertible preferred stock as a condition to the halco investment see note to consolidated financial statements  we recorded a million non cash charge to arrive at net loss available to common stock  representing the fair value of the inducement shares issued 
the fair value was based on 
per share  the price paid by halco for its purchase of million shares of our common stock 
comparison of years ended december  and for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  results of operations for include a net gain of million from the sale of the borg assets and a charge of million for the impairment of unamortized goodwill 
results of operations for include an extraordinary loss of 
million on extinguishment of debt and a charge of million from the impairment of unamortized goodwill 
sales sales for were million as compared to million in  a decrease of 
million or 
although included a full year of sales resulting from the andataco acquisition as compared to seven months during  our overall sales decreased primarily as a result of the transition from our older technology legacy products to newer technology solutions 
our current line of products is centered around our nexstor series u storage enclosures and raid systems 
we began shipping these new generation products in the third quarter of  however  during the second half of the year  the decline in revenues of our older products exceeded the increase in sales of our newer technology products 
delays in shipments of both product lines  resulting from unexpected supplier issues  which have since been resolved  also contributed to the revenue decline 
cost of sales gross margins gross margins increased from in to in gross margins in both periods were adversely affected by less than full utilization of production capacity due to lower than expected sales levels as well as increases in inventory reserves due to obsolete inventory of million and million in and  respectively 
our gross margins are dependent  in part  on product mix which fluctuates from time to time 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased to million in from million in the 
million increase is primarily the result of the inclusion in of a full twelve months of expenses related to the andataco acquisition  as compared to seven months included in operations  partially offset by an approximate million provision for uncollectable receivables in research and development research and development expenses amounted to million in  as compared to million in during january  we sold substantially all of the assets of our borg subsidiary  which had contributed 
million to our research and development expenses during the decline in costs resulting from this sale was more than offset by additional costs incurred in in connection with the development of our new nexstor series u enclosures as well as the inclusion of a full year of expenses related to the andataco acquisition 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are incurred substantially in advance of related revenues  or in certain situations  may not result in generating revenues 
depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to a full year of amortization over seven years of million of goodwill associated with the andataco acquisition  effective in june and november  and million of goodwill over seven years associated with the january acquisition of the assets of oneofus  partially offset by reduced amortization resulting from the fourth quarter write down of million of goodwill related to our parity acquisition 
the parity goodwill was determined to have been impaired because of our projected inability to generate sufficient future operating income from the assets acquired in the parity acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill write down of approximately million 
this write down eliminated all unamortized goodwill related to the andataco acquisition 
the andataco goodwill was determined to have been impaired because of our projected inability to generate sufficient future operating income from the assets acquired in the andataco acquisition 
interest expense interest expense decreased 
million to million in  primarily as a result of the satisfaction of borrowings of million by the issuance of common stock million in december and million in april 
this reduction was partially offset by a full twelve months of interest expense on the million note issued in connection with the andataco acquisition as compared to seven months of interest expense in income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  which  more likely than not  will not be realized based on recent operating results 
net loss available to common stock preferred stock dividends during and  all classes of our convertible preferred stock required dividends at per annum 
preferred stock dividends decreased by 
million to 
million during principally due to the conversion of million of preferred stock to common stock in  partially offset by the issuance of million of preferred stock in june embedded dividend attributable to benefical conversion priviledge during  we recorded 
million as an additional embedded dividend attributable to the fair value at the date of grant of warrants issued in connection with the sale of series e convertible preferred stock based on the black scholes option pricing model and the beneficial conversion privilege on series a convertible preferred stock representing the difference between the conversion price and the quoted market price of common stock at the date of issuance 
liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
this contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as shown in the consolidated financial statements  we have experienced negative cash flows from operating activities and have suffered substantial recurring net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we are not in compliance with certain covenants and provisions under our revolving credit facility which expires on april  and have been advised that the bank does not intend to renew the credit facility 
these matters  among others  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during most of  our management team formulated and implemented our current product strategy centered around our nexstor series u line of san ready storage solutions 
this strategy included the transition from our older technology legacy products to the newer technology solutions  which we began shipping in the third quarter of during  the decline in revenues of our older products exceeded the increase in sales of our newer technology solutions 
this decline in revenues combined with the recent decline in economic and market conditions has significantly contributed to our operating losses 
during  we shifted our sales and marketing strategy to provide greater technical  marketing and sales support to expand our indirect customer channel 
as part of this strategy  since january  we have significantly reduced our direct sales personnel and related costs  and are currently focusing our direct sales team to targeted markets and existing customers 
since january   and through february   we obtained million of equity and debt financing from private investors 
of these amounts  million was received from maurice halperin  the company s chairman of the board since august   and a principal stockholder or companies controlled by mr 
halperin collectively  mr 
halperin  consisting of million in cash received between august and november  and million in marketable securities received in november see note to consolidated financial statements 
from november through march  we received million in cash from the sale of all of the marketable securities see note to consolidated financial statements 
equity and debt financing obtained from january through february  also included million from h 
irwin levy  our vice chairman of the board and a principal shareholder  or companies controlled by mr 
levy collectively  mr 
levy 
additional cash of approximately million was obtained during january when we sold substantially all the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  borg adaptive technologies  inc as of december   our revolving credit facility bank line of credit provided for borrowings based on the lesser of million or i of eligible accounts receivable  as defined  plus ii the lesser of million or of eligible inventory  as defined collectively  the borrowing base 
the bank line of credit which matures in april  provides for interest at prime plus  requires a facility fee of 
based on the average unused portion of the maximum borrowings  is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  and provides for certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth and net income requirements 
since the fourth quarter of  we have not been in compliance with the minimum net worth and net income covenants under our bank line of credit 
on february   the bank advised us that the outstanding principal balance exceeded the borrowing base by million and that they were demanding immediate payment of the over advance 
the bank also indicated that our non bank indebtedness of approximately million was incurred in violation of the loan agreement 
in addition  effective february   the bank applied the following amendments to the bank line of credit an increase in the interest rate to prime plus  a decrease in the overall facility to million  and a reduction in the inventory borrowing limit to  with further reductions of of eligible inventory per week  effective february  the bank has also advised that it does not intend to renew the bank line of credit 
we have begun to seek a replacement lender but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining a new credit facility on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
as of february   the outstanding balance of the bank line of credit was million 
we are currently exploring alternatives for raising additional debt or equity capital to finance our short term and long term plans as well as operating deficits expected to be incurred until we begin to generate positive operating cash flows 
however  due to conditions in the technology related financial markets and other uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  there can be no assurances that such required additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the future 
we currently have insufficient liquidity to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern 
cash flow results operating activities net cash used in operating activities amounted to million and million for and  respectively 
the most significant use of cash for both years was our loss from operations before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items of million in and million in during and  we used cash of million and million  respectively  in the reduction of deferred revenue  accounts payable and other liabilities 
in addition  in  we used million to increase inventories 
the most significant source of cash was the reduction of accounts receivable of million in and million in investing activities net cash used in investing activities amounted to 
million in net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million in cash used for purchases of property and equipment was 
million and 
million during and  respectively

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for amounted to million  principally consisting of borrowings from private investors of million including million from mr 
levy and million from halco of which million was satisfied by issuing convertible preferred stock and 
million was satisfied by issuing common stock 
an additional million of cash was provided in by issuing convertible preferred stock to private investors including million from halco 
net cash provided by financing activities for amounted to million  principally consisting of million in net borrowings from private investors including million from mr 
levy  million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and million from our equity draw down facility 
during and  we paid 
million and 
million  respectively  in preferred stock dividends and had net repayments on our bank line of credit of million and million  respectively 
effect of inflation during recent years  inflation has not had an impact on our operations and we do not expect that it will have a material impact in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate bank line of credit
