item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and certain risks 
automated laboratory systems a systems provider  dpc designs and manufactures laboratory instruments and software to automate the performance of immunodiagnostic assays  facilitating rapid  accurate results  while reducing labor and reagent costs 
the company has two principal immunoassay platforms 
dpc s immulite addresses the needs of high volume laboratories  while the immulite serves lower volume facilities and niche markets 
at the end of  over  immulite and over  immulite systems had been shipped 
the original immulite system was first introduced in computer driven  it uses a patented solid phase wash technology and chemiluminescent detection method  which together are capable of measurements at exceptionally low concentrations  as demonstrated by dpc s state of the art third generation assays for tsh and psa key tests related to thyroid disorders and prostate cancer  respectively 
the system is totally automated with respect to sample and reagent handling  incubation  washing  and substrate addition 
dpc s immulite has the capacity for walk away processing of up to samples per hour  on a random access basis meaning that it can perform any test  or combination of tests  on any patient sample at any time 
the immulite  dpc s next generation system  was introduced in the third quarter of it has a throughput of up to tests per hour  offering the medium to high volume laboratory increased efficiency in streamlining its testing workload 
the immulite can run for a full shift without having to replenish on board supplies 
this increased throughput allows dpc to participate in a higher volume segment of the market where the average reagent use per instrument exceeds that of the original immulite 
the immulite includes advanced features such as primary tube sampling and a proprietary autodilution capability 
the system can also be interfaced with robotic laboratory sample handling systems and can be connected to the customer s computer system for specification of the tests to be run on each sample  as well as for reporting and archiving results 
another innovative feature is its remote diagnostic capability that permits dpc s service facility to access any immulite worldwide for the purpose of diagnosing system problems 
enhancements introduced in september made it possible for laboratories to perform fully automated in vitro allergy testing for the first time in dpc s history 
in  as in the previous year  the growth of dpc s business and the company s role as an ivd systems provider for high volume facilities was driven primarily by ongoing demand for the immulite in the fourth quarter  orders for immulite test kits exceeded  for the first time  those for the immulite 
demand for the original immulite continues to be strong and the company believes that it remains an important complement to the higher throughput  state of the art immulite 
table of contents immunodiagnostic test kits dpc manufactures over immunodiagnostic test kits  exploiting several technologies and assay formats 
the company s monoclonal antibody  molecular engineering  and other basic science capabilities play key roles in optimizing these immunoassays 
chemiluminescence enhanced enzyme immunoassays are the basis for dpc s automated immulite and immulite product lines 
dpc also manufactures classic radioimmunoassays rias  based on double antibody  coated tube  and irma formats  as well as enzyme immunoassays eias in microplate format 
allergy testing uses a proprietary liquid allergen technology in tube and microplate formats  and it is now fully automated on the immulite many of dpc s assays are available both as manual rias and as immulite and immulite assays 
the automated  nonisotopic product lines now represent the core of dpc s business 
immulite and immulite assays  instruments  and service represented   and of sales in   and  respectively  a trend that is expected to continue 
in fiscal year  dpc s rias accounted for of sales  while allergy and other tests accounted for 
for additional information concerning sales by product line over the last three fiscal years  see notes to consolidated financial statements note breadth of menu immulite and immulite are closed systems  they will not perform other manufacturers tests 
accordingly  a most important factor in the successful marketing of these systems is the ability to offer a broad menu of individual assays and assay groups  that is  tests which jointly represent decision making panels for various disease states  such as thyroid disorders or infertility 
many of the relevant disease states represent either high volume opportunities in the marketplace  or unique  under served conditions that allow dpc to fill a market niche 
as of december   dpc had immulite assays available in the international market  with fda cleared for sale in the us 
in addition  out of a total of of the most important assays on the second generation immulite have been released for sale in the us 
dpc believes that the immulite and immulite have the most extensive menus of any automated immunoassay systems on the market 
the company s research and development activities continue to focus on expanding the menus  giving special attention to complete implementations of clinically important assay groups  as well as on developing new generations of instrumentation and software 
the spectrum of applications major clinical applications of dpc s immunoassays include the following areas  where dpc s extensive and sometimes unique offerings on the immulite and immulite have enabled the company to achieve a significant presence in various types of laboratories  large and small 
thyroid disorders for many hospital and clinical reference laboratories  thyroid testing is a mainstay of their routine immunoassay work 
dpc offers a comprehensive spectrum of assays for assessing and monitoring thyroid status on both the immulite and the immulite the menus include not only assays for free and total thyroid hormones  but also assays with third generation capability for thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and assays for thyroid autoantibodies and other relevant analytes which are increasingly in demand 
this combination represents a complete  high quality solution for thyroid testing 
therapeutic drug monitoring tdm there is a large market for tdm assays tests for the routine monitoring of certain therapeutic drugs 
nine of the ten most frequently monitored drugs are measured by immunoassay 
in  dpc introduced assays for most of these and expects to have all nine on both automated systems in early  thus gaining full access to the tdm market 
infertility  pregnancy dpc has been an innovator and longtime market leader in reproductive hormone testing  providing an unusually broad spectrum of assays for both routine and specialized laboratories  supplemented by studies to aid in the interpretation of results and software to facilitate data manipulation  when appropriate 
some of dpc s assays reflect the special needs of fertility clinics and in vitro fertilization ivf centers 
others are important for the routine assessment of osteoporosis and hormone balance in postmenopausal women and aging men 
dpc offers a comprehensive menu of immunoassays for maternal and fetal diagnosis  monitoring  and risk assessment 
the company s growing menu relates to medical conditions in every phase of reproductive life in men  women  and children of all ages 
cancer dpc has automated a large number of assays for tumor markers on the immulite and immulite  more than any of our competitors 
in  the fda granted dpc s four automated psa assays pre market approval for screening 
the company has a number of unique offerings  including third generation 
table of contents assays capable of measuring the extremely low psa concentrations encountered after radical prostatectomy and  in partnership with matritech  dpc is in the final stages of developing an automated assay for nmp  a marker for bladder cancer 
infectious diseases infectious disease testing is one of the fastest growing segments of the ivd market and one which has generally lagged behind in automation 
dpc s commitment in this area is reflected in its development of one of the broadest menus available on an automated platform  it includes some unique assays  eg for h 
pylori  an organism responsible for stomach ulcers 
in  dpc s automated toxoplasma  rubella  and cmv assays gained acceptance in some very large reference laboratories in the us  and dpc became the first of the larger ivd companies to receive ce mark approval in europe for these and other infectious disease assays  including herpes and hepatitis b 
allergy in vitro allergy testing  representing a worldwide market of approximately million  has been dominated for the last years by pharmacia upjohn 
traditionally  such testing has required special laboratory equipment and has been time and labor intensive  and somewhat error prone due to the lack of full automation 
with its patented liquid allergen technology  dpc established itself as the second leading supplier of in vitro allergy test kits 
in  the company introduced assays for selected allergy screening panels on the immulite 
then  in september  dpc introduced a broad spectrum of assays for individual allergens on the immulite  finally making it possible for laboratories to perform high volume allergy testing along with other routine immunoassays on a fully automated system 
as a complement to immulite allergy  dpc has developed a product line alablot of confirmatory western blotting assays 
inflammatory conditions cytokines  often referred to as hormones of the immune system  represent potentially important disease markers which are being actively investigated in major centers throughout the world 
in europe and elsewhere  assays for clinically relevant cytokines are already in routine use  eg for the management of bacterial sepsis blood poisoning in intensive care units 
dpc is the only company to offer a significant menu of cytokine assays in an automated format 
moreover  dpc offers some novel tests  having obtained  for example  exclusive rights from xoma ltd 
to market an automated immunoassay for lbp lipopolysaccharide binding protein  a marker of inflammation reflecting systemic exposure to gram negative bacteria 
cardiovascular disease this is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed nations and represents a million dollar worldwide market  which continues to show very strong annual growth 
both on the immulite and the immulite  dpc now offers the most comprehensive cardiac menu available on a single platform 
the three principal assays required on an emergency basis due to their role in diagnosing acute myocardial infarction troponin i  ck mb  and myoglobin have been implemented on the immulite with turbo software  which reduces the assay time to minutes  along with other tests needed in an emergency room or intra operative setting hcg  pth 
additional assays on dpc s automated systems  including high sensitivity crp and homocysteine  put the company in an excellent position to address all aspects of cardiac testing  from diagnosis and patient management to risk assessment 
research and development activities the company devotes substantial resources to research and development to update and improve its existing products  as well as to develop new products and technologies 
in addition to developing and adding allergy testing capabilities to the immulite  the company s research and development activities include the development of the next generation immulite system and new operating software for both the immulite and the immulite r d capabilities in the united states include fully staffed departments in organic synthesis  biochemistry  antisera hybridoma  protein chemistry  molecular biology  and infectious disease  method development  instrumentation  software  and technology development 
during the years ended december    and  the company spent   and  on research and development 
the company has embarked on an aggressive development program for new instrument systems  including the sample management system  a robotic sample handling device integrated into the immulite  the immulite  an enhanced version of the immulite with windows based software  new streamlined casework and new functional capability  the immulite  which incorporates the turbo function into the immulite  the immulite  a very high throughput immunoassay system incorporating several new technologies to deliver optimal assay performance  and the immulite  a scaled down version of the immulite manufacturing and service the company s principal test kit manufacturing facility is located in los angeles  california 
approximately of test kit production is conducted at the euro dpc facility in the united kingdom 
the company s european manufacturing facilities enable the company to improve its competitiveness in the european economic 
table of contents union eeu by minimizing import duties and freight charges 
certain kits are also manufactured by dpc in china 
dpc s instrument division in new jersey designs and manufactures immulite instrumentation and engages in software development 
component parts  such as computer hardware  are supplied by original equipment manufacturers 
the company provides a one year warranty that covers parts and labor 
underwriter s laboratories inc ul list the immulite systems 
the company s and its distributors technical service personnel install new units  train customers in the use of the system  and provide maintenance and service for the instrumentation 
the euro dpc instrumentation division in the united kingdom manufactures certain components of the immulite and immulite instruments that are then assembled into the final instrument in new jersey 
dpc s los angeles and new jersey facilities are international standards organization iso registered 
euro dpc limited  the company s wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary in wales  was the first immuno diagnostics company in the world to be registered under british standard bs euro dpc is also registered to iso and european norm en standards 
dpc provides technical support for all its products  including reagents  instruments  and software  via telephone and on site service 
marketing and sales the company markets its products to hospital  clinical  forensic  research  reference  and veterinary laboratories  as well as doctors offices and us government agencies 
the company markets its products in the united states directly to laboratories and hospitals through its own sales force 
the company sells to the us doctors office market through independent distributors as well as through its own sales force 
sales personnel and distributors are trained to demonstrate the company s product line in the customer s laboratory and are supported by the company s los angeles and new jersey based technical services departments 
the company s products are sold on a worldwide basis through distributors in over foreign countries 
these distributors  including company owned distributors  also sell other manufacturer s products that are not directly competitive with the company s products 
foreign sales including export sales  sales to non consolidated foreign affiliates  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries represented approximately of sales in  in  and in europe accounted for approximately   and of total sales in   and  respectively 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding foreign operations 
sales of test kits to customers and distributors are made against individual purchase orders as well as through volume purchase arrangements 
products are shipped directly from the company s facilities in los angeles and wales and are generally delivered domestically within hours and overseas within hours of receipt of order 
the company sells  leases  or rents the immulite instrumentation to hospitals and reference laboratories that perform volume testing 
the company s backlog at any date is usually insignificant and not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
the company s foreign operations are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political and economic instability  and trade restrictions 
because the company s consolidated foreign distributors sales are in the respective local currencies  the company s consolidated financial results are affected by foreign currency translation adjustments see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the price competitiveness of the company s products abroad is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
proprietary and other rights substantially all of the company s products are based on proprietary technologies and know how 
the company holds various us and foreign patents  including patents on the washing process used in the immulite system that expire in and patents on its novel liquid based amplification methodology which forms the basis of the alastat product lines which expire in the company also obtains licenses for chemical components and technologies used in certain of its assays 
patents that may be granted to others in the future could inhibit the company s expansion or entry into certain areas  or require it to pay royalty fees to do so 
because of rapid technological developments in the immunodiagnostic industry with concurrent extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  certain of the company s products may involve controversy concerning infringement of existing patents or patents that may be issued in the future 
the company purchases certain chemical compounds that are key components in the immulite system from lumigen  inc and tropix  inc  the sole suppliers of these chemical compounds  pursuant to agreements that expire in tropix also supplies the company with certain other chemical compounds for use in veterinary kits 
upon 
table of contents termination of these supply agreements  the company will be required to enter into new supply agreements or use alternate technologies 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain alternate technology or  if attainable  that such technology will have the same performance characteristics  or that it will be able to obtain such technology from lumigen tropix or others on favorable terms 
government regulation the company s business is affected by government regulations both in the united states and abroad  in particular western europe and japan  aimed at containing the cost of medical services 
these regulations have generally had the effect of inhibiting the growth rate of the immunodiagnostic industry 
the company believes that in vitro diagnostic ivd testing is an important tool for reducing health care expenditures 
by providing early diagnosis and therapy management  ivd tests can reduce the high costs of hospitalization  surgery  and recovery 
in response to cost containment measures  hospitals  and laboratories have consolidated and have sought to increase productivity by replacing high cost labor with automated testing systems 
the company s automated systems address these market needs 
the company also seeks to develop more rapid and sensitive tests  such as dpc s third generation tsh assay  that can eliminate the need for redundant testing 
manufacturers of immunodiagnostic tests and other clinical products intended for use as human diagnostics are governed by fda regulations as well as regulations of state agencies and foreign countries 
a new in vitro product that is substantially equivalent to one already on the market can generally be sold in the united states after it is cleared for marketing by the fda 
most of the company s products fall within the substantially equivalent category 
certain medically critical in vitro diagnostic products and totally new in vitro diagnostic products  for which there are no equivalents on the market  must be cleared by the fda after in depth review that normally takes about two years prior to marketing 
the company s products can be marketed without regulatory clearance in many foreign countries 
certain countries such as brazil  australia  japan  and those in the european union eu have their own review procedures 
the company s los angeles manufacturing facilities are licensed by the california department of health services and must be operated in conformance with the fda s good manufacturing practices governing medical devices 
the company is regulated by the california department of health services with respect to its possession and use of radioactive substances and by the us drug enforcement agency with respect to the use and storage of controlled drugs and pharmaceuticals 
given the company s high proportion of sales to the european union countries  the company has undertaken the necessary steps to comply with the eu in vitro diagnostic directive ivdd 
the company was fully compliant with all relevant aspects of the eu ivdd on june  and therefore was qualified to apply the ce mark to most of it s ivd kits and instruments as mandated by the eu 
competition the company s major competitors are broad based health care companies such as roche diagnostics  abbott diagnostics abbott laboratories  bayer  johnson johnson  beckman coulter  and pharmacia upjohn sweden 
the company competes on a worldwide basis with a number of large corporations that sell diversified lines of products  including immunodiagnostic products  for laboratory  medical  and hospital use 
the fact that these companies offer diversified products to the laboratories at times puts the company at a competitive disadvantage 
there are currently over domestic suppliers of immunodiagnostic kits 
the company believes that competition in immunoassay testing is based on quality  service  product convenience  and price and that product innovation is an important source for change in market share 
the principal competitive factors in automated systems are size of menu the number of assays that can be performed on the system  ease of use  and price equipment cost  service  and reagent cost 
the company s immulite system currently offers one of the widest menus of any automated system and the company is focusing its development efforts on expanding this menu 
employees as of december   the company including its consolidated subsidiaries had  employees  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in marketing and sales  and in administration 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union  and the company considers its employee relations to be good 
the company has experienced no significant problems in recruiting qualified technical and operational personnel

these forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties  and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include the company s ability to successfully market new and existing products  the company s ability to keep abreast of technological innovations and successfully incorporate them into new products  the company s current dependence on sole suppliers for key chemical components in the immulite assays  the risks inherent in the development and release of new products  such as delays  unforeseen costs  technical difficulties  and regulatory approvals  competitive pressures  including technological advances and patents obtained by competitors  currency risks based on the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar  domestic and foreign governmental health care regulation and cost containment measures  political and economic instability in certain foreign markets  results of operations sales the company s sales increased in to million compared to sales of million in  which was a increase over sales of million

the immulite instrument  which became commercially available in march  had sales including reagents of million in  a increase over sales of million 
sales of immulite reagents increased to million  while instrument sales and service increased to million 
in  sales of the immulite product line increased 
the immulite has a longer sales process than the immulite one due to the higher sales price 
the company has also experienced a longer time delay between instrument placement and the ramp up of reagent sales with the immulite in  as in the previous year  the growth of dpc s business was driven primarily by ongoing demand for the immulite in the fourth quarter  sales of immulite test kits exceeded  for the first time  those for the immulite 
demand for the original immulite continues to be strong  however  and the company believes that it remains an important complement to the higher throughput  state of the art immulite as of december    and  the company had shipped on a cumulative basis approximately   and  immulite instruments  respectively 
this installed base of instruments and an expanding test kit menu are expected to support continued growth in the coming years 
sales of the company s mature ria or isotopic products  with sales of million in  were up slightly from million in sales in declined from it is expected that these sales levels will decline in the future 
sales of other dpc products  including allergy reagents  decreased to million in  compared to million in these sales may be negatively impacted in due to the september introduction of a broad spectrum of allergy assays on the immulite the company also experienced a decrease in sales of non dpc products through its consolidated international affiliates from million in to million in it is anticipated that the sale of non dpc products will continue to decline 
domestic sales in increased over  reflecting in part the company s success with larger customers and purchasing organizations 

table of contents foreign sales including us export sales  sales to non consolidated foreign subsidiaries  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries as a percentage of total sales were approximately   and in each of   and europe  the company s principal foreign market  represented   and of sales in   and  respectively 
sales in germany increased to million in from million in  and million in  reflecting the success of the immulite product line 
the united kingdom  italy  and china also experienced strong sales increases in sales in brazil accounted for approximately of total sales in   and as a result of the devaluation of the brazilian currency in january  the company raised its prices in local currency  making its products more expensive in brazil than they were prior to the devaluation 
however  to date this has not had a significant impact on unit sales 
due to the significance of foreign sales  the company is subject to currency risks based on the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
in periods when the us dollar is strengthening  the effect of the translation of the financial statements of consolidated foreign affiliates is that of lower sales and net income 
based on comparative exchange rates in the immediately preceding year  the translation adjustments due to the strong us dollar had a negative impact on sales 
in there was a negative impact on sales and a negative impact in due to intense competition  the company s foreign distributors are generally unable to increase prices to offset the negative effect when the us dollar is strong 
cost of sales gross margin has improved to approximately of sales in  from approximately in and  due in part to the shift in product mix toward immulite reagents  the shift in customer mix toward domestic end users  and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
although the company expects these mix trends to continue  it is also experiencing competitive pricing pressures that may negatively impact gross margins 
operating expenses and other total operating expenses selling  research and development  and general and administrative as a percentage of sales fell to in  from in and in  although all categories increased annually in absolute dollars to support the increased levels of sales 
equity in income of affiliates represents the company s share of earnings of non consolidated affiliates  principally the owned italian distributor 
this amount increased in relative to and in relative to primarily due to increased earnings of the italian distributor 
also in  equity in income of affiliates included a one time  permanent tax benefit due to a change in the italian tax laws 
net interest and other income represents the excess of interest income and interest earned on equipment contracts relating to immulite placements over interest expense and other amounts of income and expense 
net interest income and other income was an expense of  in versus income of  in the amount included  among other things  a gain of  on the sale of a product line  a gain of  on the sale of a building  and foreign exchange losses of  in  net interest and other income was  income taxes and minority interest the company s effective tax rate in and in and includes federal  state  and foreign taxes 
minority interest represents the interest in the company s brazilian distributor held by a third party 
increases or decreases in this amount reflect increases or decreases in the profitability of the brazilian distributor 
net income for increased over primarily due to increases in sales and gross profit that were greater than percentage increases in operating expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  allowance for bad debts  allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventories  useful lives selected for depreciating property  plant  and equipment  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  estimates used in the recoverability of long lived assets  and accruals for insurance 
management believes that the methodology it utilizes to determine these amounts results in the reporting of reasonable estimates  and that differences between the estimates and actual results are usually minor and are included in the consolidated financial statements by management as soon as they are known

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in business combinations occurring prior to june   will cease upon adoption of this statement 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill  and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
under sfas nos 
and  goodwill and other intangibles are initially assessed for impairment upon adoption of the statements with subsequent assessments required annually and when there is reason to suspect that their values have been diminished or impaired  with any corresponding write downs recognized as necessary 
the company was required to implement sfas no 
on july   and has determined that the impact of this statement is not material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company was required to implement sfas no 
on january  and  as a result  annual goodwill amortization of approximately million will cease 
furthermore  a transitional impairment test is required within six months of the adoption of sfas no 
the company has not completed the transition impairment test and therefore has not determined the impact that this statement will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
during the third quarter of  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
these new standards clarify and supersede existing guidance for the reporting and accounting for asset impairments and asset retirements 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company beginning january  sfas no 
will be effective for the company beginning january  the company is still in the process of evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
was not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
euro conversion the company has significant sales to european countries the participating countries which converted to a common legal currency the euro on january  the conversion to the euro will eliminate currency exchange risk among the participating countries 
the company sells its products in the participating countries through affiliated and non affiliated distributors that determine sales prices in their respective territories 
the use of a single currency in the participating countries may affect this variable pricing in the various european markets because of price transparency 
nevertheless  other market factors such as local taxes  customer preferences  and product assortment may reduce the need for price equalization 
the company has significant sales in europe and will continue to evaluate the business implications of the conversion to the euro  but at this time the company does not expect the euro conversion to have a material impact on its business 
the company has converted or upgraded certain of its european subsidiaries to a similar computer software system that will allow them to operate in the european currency environment and to create a central repository for all european information
