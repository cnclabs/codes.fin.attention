our fiscal year end is the last friday of september or the first frida y of october 
this results in a or week year depending on the calendar 
ou r first three fiscal quarters end on the friday last preceding december  march  and june or the first friday of the following month of each quarter 
for purposes of this form k  our fiscal years are described as having ended on september the   and fiscal years were week years 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from our statements of income  expressed as a percentage of revenues  for each of the periods presented 
fis cal years ended s eptember  revenues retail institutional total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling and marketing expense general and administrative expense provision for acquisition expenses operating profit interest expense  net income tax expense extraordinary loss  net of income tax net income net income excluding provision for acquisition expense n a n a management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of oper ations overview we are the largest producer and one of the fastest growing major marketers of dry pasta in north america 
we began operations in with the introduction of new  highly efficient durum wheat milling and pasta production technology 
we believe our singular focus on pasta  our vertically integrated facilities and highly efficient production facilities focused primarily on specific market segments and our highly skilled workforce make us a more efficient company and enable us to produce high quality pasta at very competitive costs 
we believe that the combination of our low cost structure  the addition of several new brands to our portfolio of brands  our scalable production facilities and our key customer relationships create significant opportunity for continued growth 
we generate revenues in two customer markets retail and institutional retail market revenues include the revenues from sales of our pasta products to customers who resell the pasta in retail channels 
these revenues represented and of our total revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively  and include sales to club stores and grocery retailers  and encompass sales of our private label and branded products 
institutional market revenues include revenues from product sales to customers who use our pasta as an ingredient in food products or who resell our pasta in the foodservice market 
it also includes revenues from opportunistic sales to government agencies and other customers that we pursue periodically when capacity is available to increase production volumes and thereby lower average unit costs 
the institutional market represented and of our total revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
average sales prices in the retail and institutional markets vary depending on customer specific packaging and raw material requirements  product manufacturing complexity and other service requirements 
average retail and institutional prices will also vary due to changes in the relative share of customer revenues and item specifi c sales volumes ie  product sales mix 
generally  average retail sales prices are higher than institutional sales prices 
we anticipate continued changes to historical income statement patterns resulting from the mueller s r brand acquisition in november  the acquisition of seven pasta brands from borden foods in july  and subsequent smaller acquisitions in september and octobe r selling prices of our branded products are significantly higher than selling prices in our other business units including private label 
this is expected to result in higher revenues  gross profits  and gross margin percentages 
revenues are reported net of cash discounts  pricing allowances an d product returns 
we seek to develop strategic customer relationships with food industry leaders that have substantial pasta requirements 
we have a long term supply agreement with sysco and other arrangements with food industry leaders  such as sam s club  that provide for the pass through of direct material cost changes as pricing adjustments 
the pass throughs are generally limited to actual changes in cost and  as a result  impact percentage profitability in periods of changing costs and prices 
the pass throughs are generally effective to days following such cost changes and thereby significantly reduce the long term exposure of our operating results to the volatility of raw material costs 
thes e pass through arrangements also require us to pass on the benefits of any price decrease in raw material cases 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  packaging  manufacturing including depreciation and distribution costs 
a significant portion of our cost of goods sold is durum wheat 
we purchase durum wheat on th e open market and  consequently  those purchases are subject to fluctuations in cost 
we manage our durum wheat cost risk through durum wheat cost pass through agreements in long term contracts and other noncontractual arrangements with our customers and advance purchase contracts for durum wheat which are generally less than twelve months duration 
our capital asset strategy is to achieve low cost production through vertical integration and investment in the most current pasta making assets and technologies 
the manufacturing and distribution related capital assets that have been or will be acquired to support this strategy are depreciated over their respective economic lives 
because of the capital intensive nature of our business and our current and future facilities expansion plans  including completion of our new facility in arizona we believe our depreciation expense for production and distribution assets may be higher than that of many of our competitors 
depreciation expense is a component of inventory cost and cost of goods sold 
plant expansion costs include incremental direct and indirect manufacturing and distribution costs that are incurred as a result of construction  commissioning and start up of ne w capital assets 
these costs are expensed as incurred but are unrelated to current production and  therefore  reported as a separate line item in the statement of operations 
by locating our newest facility in arizona closer to our western us customers  we believe we will generate significant logistical savings and provide superior service to our west coast customers  while creatin g additional capacity to support the continued rapid growth of our business sourced from our existing plants 
we believe adding this strategic location wil l further enhance our low cost producer leadership in the industry 
selling and marketing costs have increased substantially over the last two years in line with the significant expansion of our retail business 
these costs increased from fiscal year through fiscal year  and constituted of revenues for the year ended september  we do not expect continued rapid growth in our selling and marketing expenditures because we have substantially completed the development of the selling and marketing infrastructure needed to support our branded businesses 
we expect selling and marketing expense to exceed of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as noted  in november  we purchased the mueller s pasta brand from bestfoods 
in july  we purchased seven pasta brands from borden foods in addition  we purchased lensi and gooch in september and october  respectively 
as discussed below  the timing of these brand acquisitions had an impact on the period to period comparisons 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis discusses our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  whic h have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts o f assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairmen t of intangible assets  the method of accounting for stock options  the estimates used to record product return reserves  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts and derivatives 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies 
our most critical accounting policies are described below 
impairment testing of intangible assets 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
 which we adopted on october   require us to discontinue the amortization of the cost of intangible assets with indefinite lives and to perform certain fair value based tests of the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires this testing to be performed at least annually and more frequently should events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
these impairment tests are impacted by judgments as to future cash flows and brand performance 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future events could cause our management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of intangible assets are impaired 
stock options 
we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options and adopted the pr o forma disclosure requirements under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options is equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas no 
and has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black schole s option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate of for fiscal and for fiscal and  dividend yields of zero  volatility factors of the expected market price of our common stock of 
for fiscal  
for fiscal  and 
for fiscal  and a weighted average expected life of the options of one to five years 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period 
our pro forma information follows in thousands except for earnings per share information pro forma net income    pro forma earnings per share basic diluted product return reserves 
revenue is recognized generally when our products are shipped to our customers 
it is our policy across all classes of customers that all sales are final 
as is common in the consumer products industry  customers occasionally return products for a variety of reasons 
examples include product damages in transit  discontinuance of a particular siz e or form of product and shipping errors 
we record an estimate of products to be returned by customers as a reserve against sales 
we generally base this reserv e on our historical returns experience and sales volume 
significant judgment is required when estimating the reserves for product returns and there is a risk that actual product returns may differ from our estimates 
accounts receivable significant customers 
we generate approximately of our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to two customers 
if our primary customers experience significant adverse conditions i n their industry or operations  our customers may not be able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to us for prior sales or complete the purchase of additional products from us under the terms of our existing firm purchase and sale commitments 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  and our historical experience 
if circumstances chang e ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change i n a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a materia l amount 
derivatives 
we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge a variety of risk exposures including interest rate risks associated with our long term debt and foreign currency fluctuations for transactions with our overseas subsidiary 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discusse d in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading 
hedge accounting results when w e designate and document the hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
to hedge foreign currency risks  we use futures contracts 
the fair values of these instruments are determined from market quotes 
in addition  we use some over the counter forward contracts in hedging these risks 
these forward contracts are valued in a manner similar to that used by the market to value exchange traded contracts  that is  using standard valuation formulas wit h assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates  and interest rates observed in the market 
to hedge interest rate risk  an interest rate swap is used in which we pay a variable rate and receive a fixed rate 
this instrument is valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments 
the variable cash payments are base d on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interes t rate curves 
we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values o r developing the underlying assumptions 
the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market condition s change 
our derivative instruments are not subject to multiples or leverage on the underlying commodity or price index 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we consider our budgets and forecasts in determining the amounts of ou r foreign currency denominated purchases to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of our forecast we are assuming to be probable of occurring  and therefore eligible to be hedged 
the purchases are hedged for exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate and foreign currency hedges as the counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
our exposure is in liquid currency euros  so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain our hedging program would not be available in the future 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to millio n for the fiscal year ended september   from million for the fisca l year ended september  the revenue increase was primarily due to volume growth of over the prior year  and higher per unit selling prices primarily associated with the branded product line pasta acquisitions 
in addition  we benefited from a us government dumping and subsidy offset payment  with million recorded as gross retail revenue in the year 
in accordance with the intent of the act  we implemented incremental spending programs  including slotting fees to expand distribution  adding personnel and increased promotions 
after considering the incremental expenditures  most of which were recorded as a reduction of gross revenue  the net revenue impact of the dumping and subsidy offset payment was approximately million 
revenue was recognized over the balance of the year to match it with the incremental expenditures

the million in fiscal is primarily a result of million proceeds from issuance of debt net of million deferred issuance costs offset by million principal paymen t on debt and capital lease obligations 
the million in fiscal is primarily a result of million proceeds from issuance of debt  offset by million used to purchase treasury stock 
we currently use cash to fund capital expenditures  repayments of debt and working capital requirements 
we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures  repayments of debt and working capital requirements 
on july   we secured a new five year  million revolving credit facility to replace the previous million facility 
the revolver includes million of dual currency availability in euros or us dollars to finance our international business in italy 
our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants which include  among other things  financial covenants requiring minimum and cumulative earnings levels and limitations on the payment of dividends  stock purchases an d our ability to enter into certain contractual arrangements 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on business or results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the credit agreement 
at september   the three month libor rate was  the three month euribor rate was  and our weighted average bank debt borrowin g rate was 
we utilize interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contract s to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
the principal objective of such financial derivative contracts is to moderate the effect of fluctuation s in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we  as a matter of policy  do not speculate in financial markets and therefore do not hold these contracts for trading purposes 
we utilize what are considered simple instruments  such as forward foreign exchange contracts and non leveraged interest rate swaps  to accomplish our objectives 
at this time  the current and projected borrowings under our credit facility do not exceed the facility s available commitment 
the facility mature s on october  we anticipate that any borrowings outstanding at that time will be satisfied with funds from operations or will be refinanced 
we have no other material commitments 
on december   we completed an amendment to our revolving credi t facility 
the amendment provides an additional million term loan capacity 
the terms of the original revolving credit facility provide commitment reductions of million between october  and october  the additional term loan capacity is nearly sufficient to offset the cumulative annual reductions in credit availability required by the original credit facility 
the original terms of the facility remain generally the same 
we believe that net cash expected to be provided by operating activities and net cash provided by financing activities will be sufficient to meet our expected capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this new standard  when in effect  wil l supersede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the long lived assets to be disposed of  providing one accounting model fo r the review of asset impairment 
sfas no 
retains much of the recognition an d measurement provisions of sfas no 
 but removes goodwill from its scope 
it also requires long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale to be considered as held and used until disposed of  requiring the depreciable life t o be adjusted as an accounting change 
criteria to classify long lived assets to be disposed of by sale has changed from sfas no 
 but these costs will continue to be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value les s cost to sell  and will cease to be depreciated 
sfas no 
will also supercede the section of apb no 
which prescribes reporting for the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement retains the basic presentation provisions of the opinion  but requires losses on a disposal or discontinued operation to be recognized as incurred 
it also broadens the definition of a discontinued operation to includ e a component of an entity 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the objective of this statement is to provide accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets by requiring the fair value of a liability for the asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recognized  the asset retirement costs should also be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is then accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the associated asset 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of these new pronouncements to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other matters none 
effect of inflation during the last three fiscal periods  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
we have experienced increases in our cost of borrowing and raw materials  though generally not related to inflation 
in general  we have increased the majority of customer sales prices to recover significant raw material cost increases 
however  these changes in prices have historically lagged price increases in our raw material costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk associated with financial instruments relates to interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currency 
we occasionally utilize simple derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage our mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
we had various fixed interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million outstanding at september  the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements of  is the amount we would be required to pay to terminate the swap agreements at september  if interest rates for our long term debt under our credit facility had averaged more and the full amount available under our credit facility had been outstanding for the entire year  our interest expense would have increased  and income before taxes would have decreased by million for the year ended september  we hedge our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries wit h euro borrowings under our credit facility 
changes in the us dollar equivalen t of euro based borrowings is recorded as a component of the net translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity 
the functional currency for our italy operation is the euro 
at september   long term debt includes obligations of million euros million under a credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate based upon the euribor rate
