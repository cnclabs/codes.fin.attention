item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  incorporated by reference in this report 
customers for the fiscal years ended september     and  revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government accounted for    and  respectively  of total revenues 
foreign operations for the fiscal years ended september     and  revenues from the company s operations outside the united states comprised approximately    and  respectively  of total revenues 
for fiscal years and  substantially all such foreign revenues related to the company s offices in the united kingdom  ireland  france  spain and italy  with a small portion relating to the company s operations in india 
as a result of the acquisition of the stork e c businesses parts of which were completed in fiscal and fiscal  we expanded our european operations into the netherlands  belgium and germany  and we acquired operations in south east asia 
as a result of the acquisition of the gibb businesses which was completed in fiscal  we further expanded our operations in the united kingdom  and acquired businesses in other european countries 
and as a result of the acquisition of delta completed in october we further expanded our business in north america to include canada 
although the company has foreign operations located elsewhere around the world in addition to those in europe  canada and asia  revenues earned over the past five years from these other operations were not material 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts undertaken by the company  our contracts can generally be grouped into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five fiscal years ended september cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
page when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a process plant  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table presents the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the five fiscal years ended september in millions cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts provide for reimbursement of costs incurred by the company  plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred on a contract  or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract  or it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones or performance factors defined in the contract 
the company prefers this type of contract since it believes that the primary basis for its selection should be its technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price considerations 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum bid contracts 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  the company is first selected as the contractor  and then the contract price is negotiated 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where the company has the opportunity to perform engineering and design work before negotiating the total price of the project 
under lump sum bid contracts  the company must bid against other contractors based upon specifications furnished by the client 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period  that are reduced by the negotiation process 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to the company 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of the company s fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts  or lump sum bid contracts for services rather than turn key construction 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then the company will bear all or a portion of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  the company will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
competition the company is engaged in a highly competitive business 
some of our competitors are larger than us  or are subsidiaries of larger companies  and therefore may possess greater resources than the company 
furthermore  because the engineering and technical support aspects of the business does not usually require large amounts of capital  there is relative ease of market entry for a new potential entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications 
accordingly  we compete with both national and international firms in sizes ranging from very large  to a wide variety of small  regional and specialty firms 
the extent of the company s competition varies according to the industries and markets it serves  as well as the geographic areas in which the company operates 
the company s largest competitors for engineering  construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel group  inc  fluor corporation  foster wheeler corp  parsons corporation  kellogg brown root  kvaerner  abb lummus  and amec plc

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes 
in the normal course of business  the company s results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our only source for long term credit are two revolving credit agreements totaling million 
the total amounts outstanding under these facilities at september  was million 
both agreements expire in january and provide for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
our objectives in managing our interest rate risk is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations 
foreign currency risk in general  the company s exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because  generally speaking  our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies 
in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs
