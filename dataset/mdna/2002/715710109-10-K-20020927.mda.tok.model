overview pervasive software is a leading worldwide provider of embedded data management solutions and services to support the development  deployment and management of mission critical business applications 
our high performance  flexible database  pervasive 
sql  is widely installed with more than million server seats licensed to date 
pervasive 
sql offers advanced data management technology combined with a very low total cost of ownership tco  resulting in an average to improvement over another competitor s database  according to a september aberdeen group study 
with pervasive 
sql  independent software vendors isvs can create sophisticated yet low maintenance business applications that reach far beyond the desktop to easily share information from workstations to the web 
our software is designed for integration by isvs into web or client server applications sold to small to mid size enterprises smes  which typically have environments with little to no information technology it infrastructure and require self tuning  low administration products 
as a result  end users can concentrate on running their businesses instead of managing the database underlying their applications  which is particularly critical to this large market 
we derive our revenues primarily from shrink wrap licenses through isvs  value added resellers vars and distributors and through original equipment manufacturer oem license agreements with isvs 
shrink wrap license fees are variable and based generally on user count 
our oem licensing program offers isvs volume discounts and specialized technical support  training and consulting in exchange for embedding our products in software applications and paying us a royalty based on sales of their applications 
additionally  we generate revenues from version upgrades  user count upgrades  upgrades to new or additional platforms  and from upgrades to client server or web environments from single user workstation or workgroup environments 
we generally recognize revenues from software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we generally recognize revenues related to agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees when we deliver the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
we recognize per copy royalties in excess of a fixed minimum amount as revenues when such amounts are reported to us 
we operate with virtually no order backlog because our software products are shipped shortly after orders are received 
this makes product revenues in any quarter substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
we reserve for estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights  as well as for uncollectable accounts based on experience 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from our pervasive 
sql data management products 
in addition  we released pervasive 
sql i in late march and announced a related price increase effective april the next release of pervasive 
sql  v  is slated for release in mid fiscal year our future operating results will depend upon continued market acceptance of pervasive 
sql 
any decrease in demand or market acceptance for our pervasive 
sql product would have a damaging effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in july  we announced a restructuring to focus on our core data management business  including the discontinuation of our tango product line 
in june  we completed the sale of the tango technology 
we 
table of contents recorded tango as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements  therefore  the following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations 
as part of the july restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or approximately of our worldwide workforce 
the majority of the reductions occurred in our toronto office and our austin headquarters 
the workforce reduction was primarily related to the discontinuance of our tango product line  however  we also reduced a portion of our pervasive 
sql related workforce  mostly in our pervasive 
sql development organization 
in june  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or approximately of our worldwide workforce  to further improve profitability and as a precautionary measure in light of the continued uncertain economic environment 
the reduction resulted in a non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of million  including a charge for the workforce reduction and related charges for idle leased facilities and certain intangible assets 
in july  we formed a new business venture with ag tech corporation  a company developing  selling and importing packaged software  to sell and support our products in japan 
ag tech has been engaged in the sales and support of btrieve predecessor to pervasive 
sql and pervasive 
sql products since in conjunction with the joint venture  ag tech launched a new operating division staffed with specialists experienced in selling and supporting pervasive 
sql to assume responsibility for oem sales  packaged software sales  technical support and localization and translation of our products into japanese 
the new business venture has resulted in improved profitability on sales in japan as the arrangement allowed us to significantly reduce our costs in japan 
in connection with the new business venture  we obtained a less than ownership interest in ag tech and the ability to elect one director to the ag tech board of directors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs  and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and distributors 
revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue 
table of contents from training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve for the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended june  revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support sales and marketing research and development general and administrative business restructuring charge total costs and expenses operating income loss from continuing operations interest and other income  net income tax provision income loss from continuing operations before effect of adoption of new accounting principle effect of adoption of new accounting principle income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from operations income tax benefit gain loss on disposal gain loss from discontinued operations net income loss revenues we generated revenues from continuing operations of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents a decrease of from fiscal to  and a decrease of from fiscal to the decrease in revenues from continuing operations in both fiscal years and can be attributed to competitive pressures and what we believe to be a general softening in the packaged client server applications market  contributing to decreased orders for our pervasive 
sql products embedded in these applications 
the decrease in fiscal year can also be attributed to a change in the discount structure in japan following the formation of our new business venture in july we believe each of the above factors could continue to negatively affect license revenues for pervasive 
sql in the future 

table of contents licenses of our software operating on windows nt or other microsoft operating systems continue to represent approximately to of our revenues 
we expect that the percentages of our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on particular platforms will continue to change from time to time 
we cannot be certain that our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on windows nt  or any other operating system platform  will grow in the future 
international revenues  consisting of all revenues from continuing operations from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we attribute the decrease in international revenue in both fiscal years and to competitive pressures and what we believe to be a general softening in the packaged client server applications market  contributing to decreased orders for our pervasive 
sql products embedded in these applications 
the decrease in fiscal year can also be attributed to a change in the discount structure in japan following the formation of our new business venture in july we believe each of the above factors could continue to negatively affect international license revenues for pervasive 
sql in the future 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support 
cost of revenues and technical support consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support which is typically provided within days of purchase  and license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products 
cost of revenues and technical support for continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing   and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues and technical support in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to increased technical support and consulting personnel in the united states  europe and japan 
cost of revenues and technical support increased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily as a result of the decrease in revenue in fiscal the decrease in cost of revenues and technical support in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to a reduction in costs associated with technical support and training personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan  as well as reduced license fees for third party technology embedded in or bundled with our product 
we anticipate that cost of revenues and technical support will be consistent in dollar amount in the near term  primarily as a result of the continued effect of the reduction in costs associated with technical support and training personnel following our reduction in force in june  the formation of our new business venture in japan in july and reduced license fees for third party technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in dollar amount in fiscal primarily due to a reduction of costs associated with sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of sales in fiscal primarily as a result of decreased revenue 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to reduced costs associated with sales and marketing personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan in july sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of sales in fiscal primarily as a result of decreased expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount in the near term  primarily as a result of the timing and extent of product market development activities and costs associated with new product releases  marketing promotions  brand awareness campaigns and partner programs 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
research and development costs decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to the reduction in force in july research and development costs decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to reduced costs associated with research and development personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan in july we anticipate that research and development expenses will be consistent in dollar amount in the near term as a result of the continued effect of the reduction in costs associated with research and development personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan in july general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel salaries and other costs of our finance  human resources and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
we attribute the increase in dollar amount in fiscal primarily to the increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations  both domestically and internationally 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal relates primarily to reduced costs associated with general and administrative personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan in july general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal years and primarily because of the decrease in revenue during fiscal and we believe our general and administrative expenses will decrease in dollar amount in the near term as a result of reduced costs associated with general and administrative personnel 
business restructuring charge 
business restructuring charges in fiscal consist of charges related to our reduction in workforce in june and related charges for idle leased facilities and certain intangible assets 
we incurred a non recurring charge of approximately million in fiscal  representing of revenues from continuing operations 
the business restructuring was initiated to further improve profitability and as a precautionary measure in light of the continued uncertain economic environment 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes related to continuing operations was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate related to continuing operations was for fiscal we recorded a tax provision for fiscal related to taxes on our foreign operations  despite our consolidated operating loss for the year 
we recorded a tax provision for fiscal related to taxes on our foreign operations  despite the availability of substantial domestic net operating loss carryforwards 
based on a number of factors  we believe it is more likely than not  that a substantial amount of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
these factors include recent trends in revenue related to continuing operations  the potential impact of anticipated deductions due to exercise of employee stock options on deferred tax assets with limited carryforward periods  the intensely competitive market in which we operate  which is subject to rapid change 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets based on the lack of earnings history 
we expect to continue to incur foreign taxes associated with our international operations while our domestic income taxes will remain minimal as we utilize substantial net operating losses carried forward from previous years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our provision for income taxes 

table of contents effect of adoption of new accounting principle 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  statement discontinues the amortization of goodwill and requires future periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
in addition  statement requires reassessment of the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets 
with the adoption of statement  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of july  the adoption will result in a decrease in operating expense related to goodwill amortization of approximately  per year 
additionally  we completed a goodwill impairment test as allowed by statement during the first quarter of fiscal  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately  which is recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
gain loss from discontinued operations 
gain loss from discontinued operations relates to the discontinuation of the tango product line at the end of fiscal total loss from discontinued operations was million in fiscal  net of income tax benefit of million 
gain from discontinued operations in fiscal was million 
the loss in fiscal includes a million loss from operations and a million charge for estimated loss on disposal  including a reduction of tango related assets to their estimated net realizable values and accrual for estimated future liabilities of the discontinued tango operations 
the gain in fiscal is the result of the sale of the tango technology in june  as well as a reduction in the estimated future liabilities of the discontinued tango operations 

table of contents quarterly results from operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  and we believe all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below

effect of adoption of new accounting principle income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations gain on disposal gain from discontinued operations net income loss our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
we establish our expenditure levels based on expectations as to future revenue  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
as a result  a drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  our operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
see risk factors that may affect future results 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by continuing operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by continuing operations increased from fiscal to despite a loss from continuing operations in fiscal  primarily due to non cash business restructuring charges  a decrease in current assets and to a lesser extent an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in cash provided by continuing operations from fiscal to resulted primarily from the increase in earnings from continuing operations in fiscal  a decrease in current assets and an increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
during fiscal and  we received net proceeds of million and million  respectively  from the sale or maturity of marketable securities 
during fiscal  we invested a net amount of million in marketable securities  consisting of various taxable and tax advantaged securities 
in addition  we purchased property and equipment totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this property consisted primarily of computer hardware and software for our growing employee base in fiscal and general upgrade requirements in fiscal and we expect that our 
table of contents capital expenditures may increase in the next fiscal year as compared to fiscal as a result of specific capital projects anticipated to upgrade certain front and back office systems 
in october  we purchased an additional ownership interest in our majority owned subsidiary  pervasive software co  ltd 
formerly known as btrieve technologies japan  ltd  by purchasing stock held by a minority shareholder for  in cash 
the october acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and  accordingly  the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired of  was recorded as goodwill and  prior to the adoption of statement  was being amortized over a year period 
after the acquisition  we hold of the outstanding stock of pervasive software co  ltd 
we have a stock repurchase plan in place whereby we may repurchase shares of our common stock up to a total of million through july  under the plan  more than  shares of pervasive common stock have been repurchased on the open market at a total cost of approximately million in fiscal year depending on market conditions and other factors  such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
on june   we had million in working capital including million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
recently issued accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement 
statement supercedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business as required by accounting principles board no 
the provisions of statement will be effective for the fiscal year beginning july  we do not expect that the adoption of statement will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
statement addresses accounting for restructuring costs and supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
statement requires that the liability associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when the liability is incurred 
as a contrast under eitf  a liability for an exit cost is recognized when a company commits to an exit plan 
statement also establishes that a liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  statement may affect the timing and amount of recognizing restructuring costs 
we will adopt the provisions of statement for any restructuring activities initiated after june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in japan  germany  france  england  belgium and poland and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income from continuing operations of approximately million and  respectively 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating loss of approximately million and  respectively 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal 
table of contents  the result would have been an increase in operating loss of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june   and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
